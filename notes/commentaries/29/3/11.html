There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Once more all the enemies of God are summoned together. "Assemble yourselves," (Others in the same sense render, "Haste ye,) and come, all ye pagan, round about," literally "from round about," i. e., from every side, so as to compass and hem in the people of God, and then, when the net had been, as it were, drawn closer and closer round them, and no way of escape is left, the prophet prays God to send His aid; "thither cause Thy mighty ones to come down, O Lord." Against "the mighty ones" of the earth, or "the weak" who "say" they are "mighty," (the same word is used throughout,) there "come down the mighty ones of God." The "mighty ones of God," whom He is prayed to "cause to come down," i. e., from heaven, can be no other than the mighty angels, of whom it is said, they "are mighty in strength" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm">Psalm 103:20</a> (still the same word,) to whom God gives "charge over" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/91-11.htm">Psalm 91:11</a>. His own, "to keep" them "in all" their "ways," and one of whom, in this place, killed "one hundred and fourscore and five thousand" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm">2 Kings 19:35</a> of the Assyrians.

Compare "the mighty men" (Joe 3:9). Rather, Joel speaks of God's really "mighty ones" in contrast to the self-styled "mighty men" (Joe 3:9; Ps 103:20; Isa 13:3; compare Da 10:13). Auberlen remarks: One prophet supplements the other, for they all prophesied only "in part." What was obscure to one was revealed to the other; what is briefly described by one is more fully so by another. Daniel calls Antichrist a king, and dwells on his worldly conquests; John looks more to his spiritual tyranny, for which reason he adds a second beast, wearing the semblance of spirituality. Antichrist himself is described by Daniel. Isaiah (Isa 29:1-24), Joel (Joe 3:1-21) and Zechariah (Zec 12:1-14:21), describe his army of heathen followers coming up against Jerusalem, but not Antichrist himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Assemble yourselves; </span> the war proclaimed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-9.htm" title="Proclaim you this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come up:">Joel 3:9</a></span>, pro vision made, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm" title="Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears: let the weak say, I am strong.">Joel 3:10</a></span>, now hasten to the general rendezvous; embody yourselves as you march, and hasten what you can, as the word imports. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Come all; </span> not simply and in utmost latitude, but all that are here concerned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gather yourselves together round about; </span> all round about Judea, the nations near about this valley of vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thither, </span> toward Judea and Jerusalem, the church and heritage of God, cause thy mighty ones to come down; direct and lead them by thy providence, that they may pitch their tents, or encamp there; let all thy mighty ones, whether enemies of thy church gathered against it, or friends of thy church, and gathered for its defence, let them all here encamp; or all those mighty warriors which thou wilt make use of successively to punish the proud oppressors of thy church; so the Chaldeans punished Assyria, Persians and Medes punished Babylon, Alexander punished the Persians, and the divided captains successors plagued one another with wars within sight, as it were, of Jerusalem and Judah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O Lord; </span> with which the prophet comforts himself and God’s people, intimating that all these mighty ones are under God’s conduct, and he is in the midst of them to save his own people. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/joel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Assemble yourselves,....

"For Ephraim has multiplied altars for sinning, the altars have become to him for sinning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-12.htm">Hosea 8:12</a>. I wrote to him the fulnesses of my law; they were counted as a strange thing." Israel was to have only one altar, and that in the place where the Lord would reveal His name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>.). But instead of that, Ephraim had built a number of altars in different places, to multiply the sin of idolatry, and thereby heap more and more guilt upon itself. &#1500;&#1495;&#1496;&#1488; is used, in the first clause, for the act of sin; and in the second, for the consequences of that act. And this was not done from ignorance of the divine will, but from neglect of the divine commandments. &#1488;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; is a historical present, indicating that what had occurred was continuing still. These words refer unquestionably to the great number of the laws written in the Mosaic thorah. &#1512;&#1489;&#1493;, according to the chethib &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;, with &#1514; dropped, equivalent to &#1512;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-7.htm">1 Chronicles 29:7</a>, ten thousand, myriads.

The expression "the myriads of my law" is hyperbolical, to indicate the almost innumerable multitude of the different commandments contained in the law. It was also in a misapprehension of the nature of the hyperbole that the supposition originated, that &#1488;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489; was a hypothetical future (Jerome). &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493; &#1494;&#1512;, like something foreign, which does not concern them at all. </body></html>
