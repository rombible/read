It is represented by the judgment seat, the harvest, and the vintage. The hour of judgment has arrived—Jehovah Himself is judge. The harvest-time, which is the end of the world, has come—let the angel-reapers put in their sickle. In the wine-press the grapes are gathered in—let the labourers hasten to press the juice out with their feet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm" title="Put you in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their wickedness is great.">Joel 3:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Put ye in the sickle — </span>Ye executioners of divine vengeance: begin to reap; cut down sinners ripe for judgment; let the king of Assyria and his soldiers cut down Syria and its king, for their violence against my people. Let Cyaxares and his armies cut down Assyria. Let Nebuchadnezzar cut down Moab, Ammon, mount Seir, Egypt, Tyre, Zidon, and the Philistines. After this, let Cyrus destroy the Babylonians, and Alexander the Medes and Persians. And let the divided Grecian captains cut down one another, till the Romans cut them down. And when this is done, God will have mighty ones still to cut down his enemies till the final judgment, wherein they all shall for ever be destroyed. <span class="ital">For the harvest is ripe — </span>That is, they are fit for destruction, as the ripened corn for reaping. <span class="ital">Come, get you down — </span>Namely, into the appointed valley; as though they were going into a vineyard to gather grapes.

There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe - So Jesus saith, "let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them;" and this He explains, "The harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the Angels" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>. He then who saith, "put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe," is the Son of Man, who, before He became the Son of Man, was, as He is now, the Son of God, and spake this and the other things by the Prohets; they to whom He speaketh are His reapers, the Angels; and the ripeness of the harvest is the maturity of all things here, good and evil, to be brought to their last end.<p>In itself, the harvest, as well as the vintage, might describe the end of this world, as to both the good and the bad, in that the wheat is severed from the chaff and the tares, and the treading of the winepress separates the wine which is stored up from the husks which are cast away. Yet nothing is said, here of storing up aught, either the wheat or the wine, but only of the ripeness of the harvest, and that "the fats overflow, because their wickedness is great." The harvest is sometimes, although more rarely, used of destruction <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-5.htm">Isaiah 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-33.htm">Jeremiah 51:33</a>; the treading of the winepress is always used as an image of God's anger <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-15.htm">Lamentations 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-3.htm">Isaiah 63:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-15.htm">Revelation 19:15</a>; the vintage of destruction <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-6.htm">Isaiah 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-2.htm">Judges 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-1.htm">Micah 7:1</a>; the plucking off the grapes, of the rending away of single lives or souls <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-12.htm">Psalm 80:12</a>. It seems probable then, that the ripeness of the harvests and the fullness of the vats are alike used of the ripeness for destruction, that  "they were ripe in their sins, fit for a harvest, and as full of wickedness as ripe grapes, which fill and overflow the vats, through the abundance of the juice with which they swell." Their ripeness in iniquity calls, as it were, for the sickle of the reaper, the trampling of the presser.<p>For great is their wickedness - The whole world is flooded and overflowed by it, so that it can no longer contain it, but, as it were, cries to God to end it. The long suffering of God no longer availed, but would rather increase their wickedness and their damnation. So also, in that first Judgment of the whole world by water, when "all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth, God said, the end of all flesh is before Me" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-12.htm">Genesis 6:12-13</a>; and when the hundred and twenty years of the preaching of Noah were ended without fruit, "the flood came." So Sodom was "then" destroyed, when not ten righteous could be found in it; and the seven nations of Canaan were spared above four hundred years, because the "iniquity of the Amorites was not yet full" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; and our Lord says, "fill ye up the measure of your fathers - that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the earth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/23-32.htm">Matthew 23:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm">Matthew 23:35</a>. So , "God condemneth each of the damned, when he hath filled up the measure of his iniquity." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. Direction to the ministers of vengeance to execute God's wrath, as the enemy's wickedness is come to its full maturity. God does not cut off the wicked at once, but waits till their guilt is at its full (so as to the Amorites' iniquity, Ge 15:16), to show forth His own long-suffering, and the justice of their doom who have so long abused it (Mt 13:27-30, 38, 40; Re 14:15-19). For the image of a harvest to be threshed, compare Jer 51:33; and a wine-press, Isa 63:3 and La 1:15.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/joel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Put ye in the sickle; </span> ye mighty ones, ye men of war, executioners of Divine vengeance, begin to reap, cut down sinners ripe for judgment.

Jehovah's mighty ones are summoned to execute it. By the mighty ones or heroes of Jehovah are meant his heavenly hosts or angels; thus Kimchi says, "Thy mighty ones are the angels;" so also Aben Ezra. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> The execution of Jehovah's command is represented under a double figure, that of reaping grain in harvest or treading grapes in the vintage. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-15.htm">Revelation 14:15, 18</a>, we find the two figures - that of reaping the ripe grain, and of gathering the grapes and treading them. The ripeness of the grain and of the grapes is here, perhaps, the prominent idea. "He compares," says Kimchi, "those nations to the produce which is ripe, and its time for harvesting has approached, that man should thrust in the sickle to reap it. So with respect to these nations, their season to die by the sword in this valley has arrived." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Hitzig conceives that the twofold command of Jehovah is to cut off the grapes and then tread them in the wine-press. He proceeds on the wrong assumption that <span class="accented">qatsir</span>, harvest, is employed in the sense of <span class="accented">batsir</span>, vintage; that <span class="accented">maggal</span> (from <span class="accented">nagal</span>, unused to cut, pierce, wound) is for <span class="accented">mazmerah</span>, the hook of the vinedresser; while <span class="accented">bashal</span>, ripe, which he restricts to grapes, applies to grapes and corn alike. The  passage in Revelation already cited decides us in favour of (1), the judgment being represented first by the reaping of ripened grain, and then by treading grapes in the wine-press. The verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;</span>, from <span class="accented">radah</span>, to trample underfoot, and not from <span class="accented">yarad</span>, to descend, is more poetic and emphatic than the usual <span class="hebrew">&#x5d3;&#x5e8;&#x5d3;</span>; though Kimchi maintains the contrary, saying, "<span class="accented">Descend</span> ye into this valley, for it is as it were the press which is full of grapes, when it is fit to tread them; so ye house of Israel, tread these nations in this valley, and thrust in among them the sword." The fulness of the vats, again, represents the masses of the sinful nations ripe and ready for destruction; what the wine-press is to the grapes, the wine-press of God's wrath is to the wicked. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Slain-offerings for gifts they sacrifice; flesh, and eat: Jehovah has no pleasure in them: now will He remember their transgression, and visit their sins: they will return to Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a>. And Israel forgot its Creator, and built palaces: and Judah multiplied fortified cities: and I shall send fire into its cities, and it will devour its castles." With the multiplication of the altars they increased the number of the sacrifices. &#1492;&#1489;&#1492;&#1489;&#1497; is a noun in the plural with the suffix, and is formed from &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; by reduplication. The slain-offerings of my sacrificial gifts, equivalent to the gifts of slain-offerings presented to me continually, they sacrifice as flesh, and eat it; that is to say, they are nothing more than flesh, which they slay and eat, and not sacrifices in which Jehovah takes delight, or which could expiate their sins. Therefore the Lord will punish their sins; they will return to Egypt, i.e., be driven away into the land of bondage, out of which God once redeemed His people. These words are simply a special application of the threat, held out by Moses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-68.htm">Deuteronomy 28:68</a>, to the degenerate ten tribes. Egypt is merely a type of the land of bondage, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-6.htm">Hosea 9:6</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a> the sin of Israel is traced back to its root. This is forgetfulness of God, and deification of their own power, and manifests itself in the erection of &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, palaces, not idolatrous temples. Judah also makes itself partaker of this sin, by multiplying the fortified cities, and placing its confidence in fortifications. These castles of false security the Lord will destroy.
