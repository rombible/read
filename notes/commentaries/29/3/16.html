The majestic roar of the lion is transferred to express victorious utterance of the Lord’s judgment: it is irresistible. As St. Paul wrote, “The Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1Thessalonians 2:16</a>).

There is no escaping God's judgments; hardened sinners, in that day of wrath, shall be cut off from all comfort and joy. Most of the prophets foretell the same final victory of the church of God over all that oppose it. To the wicked it will be a terrible day, but to the righteous it will be a joyful day. What cause have those who possess an interest in Christ, to glory in their Strength and their Redeemer! The acceptable year of the Lord, a day of such great favour to some, will be a day of remarkable vengeance to others: let every one that is out of Christ awake, and flee from the wrath to come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord shall roar out of Zion - As in the destruction of Sennacherib, when he was now close upon his prey, and "shook his hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem, the Lord of hosts lopped the bough with terror, and the high ones of stature were hewn down, and the haughty were humbled <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-32.htm">Isaiah 10:32-33</a>, so at the end.

When the multitudes of God's enemies were thronged together, then would He speak with His Voice of terror. The terrible voice of God's warnings is compared to the roaring of a lion.

The figures of the lion’s roar, and of the noise of thunder, are combined. The details of the judgement are not described; but it must no doubt be imagined that in the storm, and the earthquake accompanying it (see the next words), the nations are struck down and destroyed (comp. for the figure <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm" title="Behold, the Lord has a mighty and strong one, which as a tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the hand.">Isaiah 28:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/29-6.htm" title="You shall be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and the flame of devouring fire....">Isaiah 29:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/30-30.htm" title="And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and shall show the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with scattering, and tempest, and hailstones....">Isaiah 30:30-31</a>).

The presence of Jehovah is the immediate occasion of these terrors; and hence his voice proceeds from Jerusalem, or more particularly from Zion, where the visible symbol of his presence long dwelt. "For there," says Kimchi, "was his dwelling in Jerusalem; and as if from thence he roared and uttered his voice against them." Thus far the prophet pictures in very vivid, indeed terribly vivid, colours the frightful scene in the valley of decision: then stops short without describing the sad catastrophe resulting from the actual execution of the judgment. This he omits, either from revulsion of feeling from such misery. or the reader <span class="accented">is</span> left to imagine it himself. <span class="cmt_word">But the Lord will be the Hope of his people, and the Strength of the children of Israel</span>. He shrinks, as we have seen, from describing the actual execution of judgment, and, breaking off with somewhat of abruptness, exhibits the bright side of the picture. With the destruction of his foes is joined, as usual, the deliverance of his friends. To his people he stands in the double relation of a Place of refuge (<span class="accented">machseh</span>) and a Place of strength (<span class="accented">ma'oz</span>), that is, not only a place to which they may flee for safety, but a place in which, as a stronghold, they shall be kept safe. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against false security. The earthly prosperity of the people and kingdom was no security against destruction. Because Israel had fallen away from its God, it should not enjoy the blessing of its field-produce, but should be carried away to Assyria, where it would be unable to keep any joyful feasts at all. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>. "Rejoice not, O Israel, to exult like the nations: for thou hast committed whoredom against thy God: hast loved the wages of whoredom upon all corn-floors. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>. The threshing-floor and press will not feed them, and the new wine will deceive it." The rejoicing to which Israel was not to give itself up was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-2.htm">Hosea 9:2</a>, rejoicing at a plentiful harvest. All nations rejoiced, and still rejoice, at this (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>), because they regard the blessing of harvest as a sign and pledge of the favour and grace of God, which summon them to gratitude towards the giver. Now, when the heathen nations ascribed their fights to their gods, and in their way thanked them for them, they did this in the ignorance of their heart, without being specially guilty on that account, since they lived in the world without the light of divine revelation. But when Israel rejoiced in a heathenish way at the blessing of its harvest, and attributed this blessing to the Baals (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>), the Lord could not leave this denial of His gracious benefits unpunished. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; belongs to &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;, heightening the idea of joy, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-22.htm">Job 3:22</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514; does not give the object of the joy ("that thou hast committed whoredom:" Ewald and others), but the reason why Israel was not to rejoice over its harvests, namely, because it had become unfaithful to its God, and had fallen into idolatry. &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, to commit whoredom out beyond God (by going away from Him). The words, "thou lovest the wages of whoredom upon all corn-floors," are to be understood, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>, as signifying that Israel would not regard the harvest-blessing upon its corn-floors as gifts of the goodness of its God, but as presents from the Baals, for which it had to serve them with still greater zeal. There is no ground for thinking of any peculiar form of idolatry connected with the corn-floors. Because of this the Lord would take away from them the produce of the floor and press, namely, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, by banishing the people out of the land. Floor and press will not feed them, i.e., will not nourish or satisfy them. The floor and press are mentioned in the place of their contents, or what they yield, viz., for corn and oil, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-27.htm">2 Kings 6:27</a>. By the press we must understand the oil-presses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-24.htm">Joel 2:24</a>), because the new wine is afterwards specially mentioned, and corn, new wine, and oil are connected together in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>, 24. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; refers to the people regarded as a community. </body></html>
