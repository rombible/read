Those that place their happiness in the delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbed in the enjoyment, lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishes more than ever. See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very sore judgment.

Lastly, it is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm" title="Prostitution and wine and new wine take away the heart.">Hosea 4:11</a>, in company with “whoredom and wine,” as “taking away the heart” (i.e. the understanding).

Whether, however, <span class="ital">tîrôsh</span> denoted <span class="ital">always</span> a fermented liquid, is more than we can say. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and one said, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them all.">Isaiah 65:8</a><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth</span>. This verse is closely connected with the preceding, for the failure of the meat offerings and drink offerings was owing to the devastation of the country and the destruction of its crops by the locust-plague. The field was laid waste by them, nor was it a field here and there, or a solitary district; it was the whole land without exception or exemption that had cause to grieve, "if aught inanimate e'er grieves." This is expressed by one of those paronomasias of which the Hebrews were so fond, thus, <span class="accented">shuddad sadheh</span>, <span class="accented">abhelah adhamah</span>, equivalent to "field falls, ground grieves;" or "field fruitless, land laments." The oblation, or meat offering, consisted of flour mingled with oil; the libation, or drink offering, consisted of wine. There were also firstfruits of corn and wine and oil; while all the produce of the land was tithabla. Now, however, the corn was wasted and the oil languished; and therefore the meat offering had partially failed or entirely ceased; the new wine was dried up, and therefore the drink offering must needs have been given up. The mention of corn and wine and oil in particular is owing to their connection with the temple service, for the firstfruits, tithes, oblations, and libations depended largely upon them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Their drinking has degenerated; whoring they have committed whoredom; their shields have loved, loved shame. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-19.htm">Hosea 4:19</a>. The wind has wrapt it up in its wings, so that they are put to shame because of their sacrifices." &#1505;&#1512; from &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to fall off, degenerate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; is probably strong, intoxicating wine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>); here it signifies the effect of this wine, viz., intoxication. Others take sa&#770;r in the usual sense of departing, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-14.htm">1 Samuel 1:14</a>, and understand the sentence conditionally: "when their intoxication is gone, they commit whoredom." But Hitzig has very properly object to this, that it is intoxication which leads to licentiousness, and not temperance. Moreover, the strengthening of hisnu&#772; by the inf. abs. is not in harmony with this explanation. The hiphil hizna&#770;h is used in an emphatic sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-10.htm">Hosea 4:10</a>. The meaning of the last half of the verse is also a disputed point, more especially on account of the word &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, which only occurs here, and which can only be the imperative of &#1497;&#1492;&#1489; (&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;), or a contraction of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;. All other explanations are arbitrary. But we are precluded from taking the word as an imperative by &#1511;&#1500;&#1493;&#1503;, which altogether confuses the sense, if we adopt the rendering "their shields love 'Give ye' - shame." We therefore prefer taking &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; as a contraction of &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, and &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; as a construction resembling the pealal form, in which the latter part of the fully formed verb is repeated, with the verbal person as an independent form (Ewald, 120), viz., "their shields loved, loved shame," which yields a perfectly suitable thought. The princes are figuratively represented as shields, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/47-10.htm">Psalm 47:10</a>, as the supporters and protectors of the state. They love shame, inasmuch as they love the sin which brings shame. This shame will inevitably burst upon the kingdom. The tempest has already seized upon the people, or wrapt them up with its wings (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-11.htm">Psalm 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-3.htm">Psalm 104:3</a>), and will carry them away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). &#1510;&#1512;&#1512;, literally to bind together, hence to lay hold of, wrap up. Ru&#772;a&#774;ch, the wind, or tempest, is a figurative term denoting destruction, like &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495; &#1511;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-3.htm">Ezekiel 5:3-4</a>. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; refers to Ephraim represented as a woman, like the suffix attached to &#1502;&#1490;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-18.htm">Hosea 4:18</a>. &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, to be put to shame on account of their sacrifices, i.e., to be deceived in their confidence in their idols (bo&#772;sh with min as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-36.htm">Jeremiah 2:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-13.htm">Jeremiah 12:13</a>, etc.), or to discover that the sacrifices which they offered to Jehovah, whilst their heart was attached to the idols, did not save from ruin. The plural formation &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; for &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; only occurs here, but it has many analogies in its favour, and does not warrant our altering the reading into &#1502;&#1494;&#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, after the Sept. &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, as Hitzig proposes; whilst the inadmissibility of this proposal is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that there is nothing to justify the omission of the indispensable &#1502;&#1503;, and the cases which Hitzig cites as instances in which min is omitted (viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-14.htm">Psalm 68:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-11.htm">Deuteronomy 23:11</a>) are based upon a false interpretation. </body></html>
