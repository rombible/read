With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sanctify ye a fast - He does not say only, "proclaim," or "appoint a fast," but "sanctify it." Hallow the act of abstinence, seasoning it with devotion and with acts meet for repentance. For fasting is not accepted by God, unless done in charity and obedience to His commands. : "Sanctify" it, i. e., make it an offering to God, and as it were a sacrifice, a holy and blameless fast." : "To sanctify a fast is to exhibit abstinence of the flesh, meet toward God, with other good. Let anger cease, strife be lulled. For in vain is the flesh worn, if the mind is not held in from evil passions, inasmuch as the Lord saith by the prophet, "Lo! in the day of your fast you find your pleasures" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-3.htm">Isaiah 58:3</a>. The fast which the Lord approveth, is that which lifteth up to Him hands full of almsdeeds, which is passed with brotherly love, which is seasoned by piety. What thou substractest from thyself, bestow on another, that thy needy neighbor's flesh may be recruited by means of that which thou deniest to thine own."<p>Call a solemn assembly - Fasting without devotion is an image of famine. At other times "the solemn assembly" was for festival-joy. Such was the last day of the feast of the Passover <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-8.htm">Deuteronomy 16:8</a> and of tabernacles <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-35.htm">Numbers 29:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-9.htm">2 Chronicles 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-18.htm">Nehemiah 8:18</a>. No servile work was to be done thereon. It was then to be consecrated to thanksgving, but now to sorrow and supplication. : "The prophet commands that all should be called and gathered into the Temple, that so the prayer might be the rather heard, the more they were who offered it. Wherefore the Apostle besought his disciples to pray for him, that so what was asked might be obtained the more readily through the intercession of many."<p>Gather the elders - Age was, by God's appointment <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>, held in great reverence among the Hebrews. When first God sent Moses and Aaron to His people in Egypt, He bade them collect the elders of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-16.htm">Exodus 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-29.htm">Exodus 4:29</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-28.htm">Deuteronomy 31:28</a>) to declare to them their own mission from God; through them He conveyed the ordinance of the Passover to the whole congregation <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-3.htm">Exodus 12:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21</a>; in their presence was the first miracle of bringing water from the rock performed (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-5.htm">Exodus 17:5</a>, add <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm">Exodus 18:12</a>); then He commanded Moses to choose seventy of them, to appear before Him before He gave the law <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm">Exodus 24:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9</a>; then to bear Moses' own burden in hearing the causes of the people, bestowing His spirit upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> ff). The elders of each city were clothed with judicial authority <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-12.htm">Deuteronomy 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-15.htm">Deuteronomy 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-7.htm">Deuteronomy 25:7</a>. In the expiation of an uncertain murder, the elders of the city represented the whole city <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-3.htm">Deuteronomy 21:3-6</a>; in the offerings for the congregation, the elders of the congregation represented the whole <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-15.htm">Leviticus 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-1.htm">Leviticus 9:1</a>.<p>So then, here also, they are summoned, chief of all, that "the authority and example of their grey hairs might move the young to repentance." : "Their age, near to death and ripened in grace, makes them more apt for the fear and worship of God." All however, "priests, elders," and the "inhabitants," or "people of the land" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/1-18.htm">Jeremiah 1:18</a>, were to form one band, and were, with one heart and voice, to cry unto God; and that "in the house of God." For so Solomon had prayed, that God would "in heaven His dwelling place, hear whatever prayer and supplication" might there be "made by any man or by all His people Israel" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-39.htm">1 Kings 8:39</a>; and God had promised in turn, "I have hallowed this house which thou hast built, to put My name there for ever, and Mine eyes and Mine heart shall be there perpetually" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-3.htm">1 Kings 9:3</a>. God has given to united prayer a power over Himself, and "prayer overcometh God" . The prophet calls God "your" God, showing how ready He was to hear; but he adds, "cry unto the Lord;" for it is not a listless prayer, but a loud earnest cry, which reacheth to the throne of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

The essence of a fast consists in the voluntary abstention, for a season, even from ordinary and innocent bodily enjoyment; it is thus an expression of sympathy with human affliction,—for instance during mourning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-13.htm" title="And they took their bones, and buried them under a tree at Jabesh, and fasted seven days.">1 Samuel 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm" title="And they mourned, and wept, and fasted until even, for Saul, and for Jonathan his son, and for the people of the LORD, and for the house of Israel; because they were fallen by the sword.">2 Samuel 1:12</a>. More often, however, it is mentioned as a distinctly religious observance, expressive of self-abasement and sorrow for sin, and resorted to, especially at the time of some grave disaster, whether on the part of individuals or the nation, in conjunction with prayer or sacrifice, for the purpose, if possible, of propitiating God’s favour; see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">Jdg 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-6.htm" title="And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, We have sinned against the LORD.

The command is addressed to the priests as the representatives and rulers of the people in all matters of religion; they communicated to the people the commands of Jehovah. This verse directs attention to three things  - the duty commanded; the persons called upon to discharge it; and the place of its performance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The duty required was a fast and a solemn assembly; and the priests are strictly enjoined to see to it that both these shall be duly announced and rightly observed. The fast was abstention from food in token of sorrow for sin; it was intended to be the external evidence of penitential sorrow for sin. The solemn assembly, or "day of restraint," as it stands in the margin, was a public meeting of the people for the purpose of solemn supplication that the Almighty might be entreated to deliver them from the sore calamity with which he had seen fit to visit them. It was a season during which they were restrained from all servile work, and attention given exclusively to humiliation and prayer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The persons summoned for this purpose were the elders, those who were so both by age and office - the magistrates as examples to others, and as having been implicated in the sins from which they now suffered. With the word "elders" are joined all the inhabitants of the land - the whole of the people, poor ann rich alike; all had had their share in the national sin, all were sharers in the national suffering, and it therefore behoved all to repent of their sins and seek the Lord. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The place of assembly was the house of the Lord; that is, the temple, or that portion of it called "the court of the Israelites." Nor were they to assemble there without an errand; the purpose of their assembling in that sacred place was to supplicate the Lord to alleviate their distress, or rather remove it altogether. They were directed to cry mightily to the Lord; to cry unto him with vehement earnestness and importunate perseverance till he would be pleased to send relief. The proclamation of a fast was a common expedient, to which people, Jewish and Gentile, according to their respective  light, resorted in the day of their difficulty and distress. We read of it on many occasions; for example, by King Jehoshaphat in prospect of a hostile attack by the allied armies of Moab, Ammon, and Edom; again in the reign of Jehoiakim; also by Ezra in the day of danger; and by the people of Nineveh in consequence of the preaching of Jonah. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O Ephraim, thou hast committed whoredom; Israel has defiled itself. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>.

By &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, the whoredom of Ephraim is designated as in fact lying before them, and therefore undeniable; but not, as Hitzig supposes, an act which has taken place once for all, viz., the choice of a king, by which the severance of the kingdoms and the previous idolatry had been sanctioned afresh. &#1504;&#1496;&#1502;&#1488;, defiled by whoredom, i.e., idolatry.
