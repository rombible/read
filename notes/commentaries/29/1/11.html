Those that place their happiness in the delights of sense, when deprived of them, or disturbed in the enjoyment, lose their joy; whereas spiritual joy then flourishes more than ever. See what perishing, uncertain things our creature-comforts are. See how we need to live in continual dependence upon God and his providence. See what ruinous work sin makes. As far as poverty occasions the decay of piety, and starves the cause of religion among a people, it is a very sore judgment. But how blessed are the awakening judgments of God, in rousing his people and calling home the heart to Christ, and his salvation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be ye ashamed, O ye farmers - The prophet dwells on and expands the description of the troubles which he had foretold, setting before their eyes the picture of one universal dessolation. For the details of sorrow most touch the heart, and he wished to move them to repentance. He pictures them to themselves; some standing aghast and ashamed of the fruitlessness of their toil others giving way to bursts of sorrow, and all things around waste and dried. Nothing was exempt. Wheat and barley, widespread as they were (and the barley in those countries, "more fertile"  than the wheat,) perished utterly. The rich juice of the vine, the luscious sweetness of the fig the succulence of the ever-green pomegranate, the majesty of the palm tree, the fragrance of the eastern apple, exempted them not. All, fruitbearing or barren, were dried up, for joy itself, and every source of joy was dried up from the sons of men.<p>All these suggest a spiritual meaning. For we know of a spiritual harvest, souls born to God, and a spiritual vineyard, the Church of God; and spiritual farmers and vinedressers, those whom God sends. The trees, with their various fruits were emblems of the faithful, adorned with the various gifts and graces of the Spirit. All well-nigh were dried up. Wasted without, in act and deed, the sap of the Spirit ceased within; the true laborers, those who were jealous for the vineyard of the Lord of hosts were ashamed and grieved. : "Husbandmen" and "vinedressers," are priests and preachers; "farmers" as instructors in morals, "vinedressers" for that joy in things eternal, which they infuse into the minds of the bearers. "Husbandmen," as instructing the soul to deeds of righteousness; vinedressers, as exciting the minds of hearers to the love of wisdom. Or, "farmers," in that by their doctrine they uproot earthly deeds and desires; "vinedressers," as holding forth spiritual gifts." "The vine is the richness of divine knowledge; the fig the sweetness of contemplation and the joyousness in things eternal." The pomegranate, with its manifold grains contained under its one bark, may designate the variety and harmony of graces, disposed in their beautiful order. "The palm, rising above the world." : "Well is the life of the righteous likened to a palm, in that the palm below is rough to the touch, and in a manner enveloped in dry bark, but above it is adorned with fruit, fair even to the eye; below it is compressed by the enfoldings of its bark; above, it is spread nut in amplitude of beautiful greenness. For so is the life of the elect, despised below, beautiful above. Down below, it is, as it were, enfolded in many barks, in that it is straitened by innumerable afflictions. But on high it is expanded into a foliage, as it were, of beautiful greenness by the amplitude of the rewarding." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

People are thus often said to be “ashamed,” when the help, or support, on which they rely fails them: see e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-29.htm" title="For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which you have desired, and you shall be confounded for the gardens that you have chosen.">Isaiah 1:29</a> (the Israelites to be ‘ashamed’ of the oaks which they have desired, i.e. disappointed of the rewards which they hoped that the rites observed under them would bring them), <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-5.htm" title="And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their expectation, and of Egypt their glory.">Isaiah 20:5</a> (those who rely upon Egypt to be “ashamed,” i.e. disappointed; similarly <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-5.htm" title="They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them, nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.">Isaiah 30:5</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-20.htm" title="They were confounded because they had hoped; they came thither, and were ashamed.">Job 6:20</a> (caravans in the wilderness, travelling to a wady in which they expect to find water, are “ashamed” when they arrive there and find none). With the usage here, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-3.htm" title="And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads.">Jeremiah 14:3</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, 4<span class="ital">b</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">vine-dressers</span>] more exactly, <span class="ital">vineyard-keepers</span>.

The verb from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span> (formed from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>), to be or feel ashamed, or turn pale with shame; <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e4;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;</span> is "to blush or turn red with shame." It is written defectively, to distinguish it from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, which occurs in the tenth verse and again in the twelfth, and which is the Hiph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, to be parched or dried up. Their hope was disappointed through the destruction of their wheat and barley - their most serviceable and valuable cereals; while disappointment of hope causes shame; hence we read of a "hope that maketh not ashamed, because it never disappoints as empty hopes do. <span class="cmt_word">Howl, O ye vinedressers, for the wheat and for the harley; because the harvest of the field is perished. The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth</span>. There is a transposition here which is a species of the figure <span class="accented">ehiasmus</span>, so called from the form of the Greek letter <span class="accented">chi</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;</span>). The husbandmen are put to shame on account of the destruction of the wheat and barley - the entire failure of their field crops and ruin of their harvest; while the vinedressers have reason to howl because of the loss of their vines and the languishing of their fig trees. The prophet, after particularizing the vine and fig tree, proceeds with the enumeration of other important fruit trees that had perished by the teeth of the locusts. <span class="cmt_word">The pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even all the trees of the field, are withered</span>. The pomegranate, though abundant in that region, had shared the fate of the fig and vine; even the palm tree, the date palm, though a vigorous tree and little subject to injury, having no juice in the leaves or fresh greenness in the rind, ceased to flourish; and the apple tree - the medicinal apple, as Virgil terms it - suffered in like manner. Nor was it the fruit trees only that were injured; the hardier forest or timber trees - all the trees of the field - shared in the calamity. Thus Jerome represents the prophet as asking, "Why should I speak of the corn, wine, oil, and barley? when even the fruits of the trees have been dried up, the fig trees have languished, with the pomegranate and palm and apple; and all trees, whether fruit-bearing or not, are consumed by the devastating locusts." <span class="cmt_word">Because joy is withered away from the sons of men</span>. This clause is connected by" because" with "howl," the intermediate words being treated  parenthetically or passed over. Joy here is either <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> literal; while "withered" is figurative, and signifies "has ceased or been taken away;" or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> "joy" is figurative, denoting the means of joy, and" withered" may then be understood literally. The <span class="accented">rain</span>, from, is a pregnant construction, that is, "is withered from" being equivalent to "is withered and <span class="accented">taken away</span> from" the sons of men. Thus Kimchi: "<span class="accented">Because joy</span> <span class="accented">is withered  - is withered</span>, as if he said, 'it has ceased because the products and the fruits are the joy of the sons of men,' and so Jonathan explains it, 'because joy has ceased;' or the meaning of 'withered' may be by way of figure." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the words "Hear ye this," the reproof of the sins of Israel makes a new start, and is specially addressed to the priests and the king's house, i.e., the king and his court, to announce to the leaders of the nation the punishment that will follow their apostasy from God and their idolatry, by which they have plunged the people and the kingdom headlong into destruction. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1-5</a> form the first strophe. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-1.htm">Hosea 5:1</a>. "Hear ye this, ye priests; and give heed thereto, O house of Israel; and observe it, O house of the king! for the judgment applies to you; for ye have become a snare at Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor." By the word "this," which points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/5-4.htm">Hosea 5:4</a>, the prophecy that follows is attached to the preceding one. Beside the priests and the king's house, i.e., the royal family, in which the counsellors and adjutants surrounding the king are probably included, the house of Israel, that is to say, the people of the ten tribes regarded as a family, is summoned to hear, because what was about to be announced applied to the people and kingdom as a whole. There is nothing to warrant our understanding by the "house of Israel," the heads of the nation or elders. La&#770;kjem hammishpa&#770;t does not mean, It rests with you to know or to defend the right; nor, "Ye ought to hear the reproof," as Hitzig explains it, for mishpa&#770;t in this connection signifies neither "the maintenance of justice" nor "a reproof," but the judgment about to be executed by God, &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; (lxx). The thought is this, The judgment will fall upon you; and la&#770;khem refers chiefly to the priests and the king's house, as the explanatory clause which follows clearly shows. It is impossible to determine with certainty what king's house is intended. Probably that of Zechariah or Menahem; possibly both, since Hosea prophesied in both reigns, and merely gives the quintessence of his prophetical addresses in his book. Going to Asshur refers rather to Menahem than to Zechariah (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm">2 Kings 15:19-20</a>). In the figures employed, the bird-trap (pach) and the net spread for catching birds, it can only be the rulers of the nation who are represented as a trap and net, and the birds must denote the people generally who are enticed into the net of destruction and caught (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>).<p>(Note: Jerome has given a very good explanation of the figure: "I have appointed you as watchmen among the people, and set you in the highest place of honour, that ye might govern the erring people; but ye have become a trap, and are to be called sportsmen rather than watchmen.")<p>Mizpah, as a parallel to Tabor, can only be the lofty Mizpah of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-17.htm">Judges 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-29.htm">Judges 11:29</a>) or Ramah-Mizpah, which probably stood upon the site of the modern es-Salt (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-43.htm">Deuteronomy 4:43</a>); so that, whilst Tabor represents the land on this side of the Jordan, Mizpah, which resembled it in situation, is chosen to represent the land to the east of the river.<p>(Note: As Tabor, for instance, rises up as a solitary conical hill (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-6.htm">Judges 4:6</a>), so es-Salt is built about the sides of a round steep hill, which rises up in a narrow rocky valley, and upon the summit of which there stands a strong fortification (see Seetzen in Burckhardt's Reisen in Syrien, p. 1061).)<p>Both places were probably noted as peculiarly adapted for bird-catching, since Tabor is still thickly wooded. The supposition that they had been used as places of sacrifice in connection with idolatrous worship, cannot be inferred from the verse before us, nor is it rendered probable by other passages. </body></html>
