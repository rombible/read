Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hear this, ye old men - By reason of their age they had known and heard much; they had heard from their fathers, and their father's fathers, much which they had not known themselves. Among the people of the east, memories of past times were handed down from generation to generation, for periods, which to us would seem incredible. Israel was commanded, so to transmit the vivid memories of the miracles of God. The prophet appeals "to the old men, to hear," and, (lest, anything should seem to have escaped them) to the whole people of the land, to give their whole attention to this thing, which he was about to tell them, and then, reviewing all the evils which each had ever heard to have been inflicted by God upon their forefathers, to say whether this thing had happened in their days or in the days of their fathers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3.

What the prophet was about to relate, concerning the consumption of the fruits of the earth, by various sorts of creatures, and by a drought; and these are called upon to declare if ever the like had been known or heard of by them; who by reason of age had the greatest opportunities of knowledge of this sort, and could remember what they had heard or seen, and would faithfully relate it: this maybe understood of elders in office, as well as in age; <p>and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land; or "earth", not of the whole earth; but of the land of Judea; who were more particularly concerned in this affair, and therefore are required to listen attentively to it: <p>hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your fathers? that is, not the selfsame thing, but anything equal to it; a judgment of the same kind and nature, and of the same degree. By this question it seems the like had never been in the memory of any man living; nor in former times, in the days of their ancestors, as could be averted upon report; or attested on the credit of annals, chronicles, or other methods of conveying the history of ages past.

"Whoring and wine and new wine take away the heart (the understanding"). Zenu&#772;th is licentiousness in the literal sense of the word, which is always connected with debauchery. What is true of this, namely, that it weakens the mental power, shows itself in the folly of idolatry into which the nation has fallen. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. "My nation asks its wood, and its stick prophesies to it: for a spirit of whoredom has seduced, and they go away whoring from under their God." &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493; is formed after &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, to ask for a divine revelation of the idols made of wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>), namely, the teraphim (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>). This reproof is strengthened by the antithesis my nation, i.e., the nation of Jehovah, the living God, and its wood, the wood made into idols by the people. The next clause, "and its stick is showing it," sc. future events (higg&#305;&#772;d as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22-23</a>, etc.), is supposed by Cyril of Alexandria to refer to the practice of rhabdomancy, which he calls an invention of the Chaldaeans, and describes as consisting in this, that two rods were held upright, and then allowed to fall while forms of incantation were being uttered; and the oracle was inferred from the way in which they fell, whether forwards or backwards, to the right or to the left. The course pursued was probably similar to that connected with the use of the wishing rods.<p>(Note: According to Herod. iv. 67, this kind of soothsaying was very common among the Scythians (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>). Another description of rhabdomancy is described by Abarbanel, according to Maimonides and Moses Mikkoz: cf. Marck and Rosenmller on this passage.)<p>The people do this because a spirit of whoredom has besotted them.<p>By ru&#772;a&#774;ch zenu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m the whoredom is represented as a demoniacal power, which has seized upon the nation. Zenu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m probably includes both carnal and spiritual whoredom, since idolatry, especially the Asherah-worship, was connected with gross licentiousness. The missing object to &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; may easily be supplied from the context. &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, which differs from &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>), signifies "to whore away from under God," i.e., so as to withdraw from subjection to God. </body></html>
