Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Tell ye your children of it - In the order of God's goodness, generation was to declare to generation the wonders of His love. "He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers that they should make them known to their children, that the generation to come might know them, the children which should be born, who should arise and declare them to their children that they might ... not forget the works of God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-7</a>. This tradition of thankful memories God, as the Psalmist says, enforced in the law; "Take heed to thyself, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, but teach them thy sons and thy sons' sons" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; add <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>). This was the end of the memorial acts of the ritual, that their sons might inquire the meaning of them, the fathers tell them God's wonders <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-20.htm">Deuteronomy 6:20-24</a>. Now contrariwise, they are, generation to generation, to tell concerning it, this message of unheard-of woe and judgment. The memory of God's deeds of love should have stirred them to gratitude; now He transmits to them memories of woe, that they might entreat God against them, and break off the sins which entail them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The prophet thus draws attention to the event which be is about to relate, or rather predict, a8 a calamity unknown in the memory of living men, unheard of in the days of their fathers, unparalleled in the past experience of their nation, and one affecting all the inhabitants of the land. He challenges the old men whose memory went furthest back, and whose experience had been longest and largest, to confirm his statements; he calls on the inhabitants of the land to consider an event in which they were all concerned, and to recognize the hand of God in a disaster in which all would be involved. But, though the visitation with which they are threatened had had no precedent or parallel among the generation then present, or that which preceded it, or for many long years before, it was not to remain without memorial or record in the time to come. To this end the prophet commands his countrymen of Judah to relate it to their children, to their grandchildren, and even to their great-grand-children. The expression reminds us of Virgil's - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Yea, sons of sons, and those who shall from them be born."</span> It reads like a reminiscence of what is recorded of one of the plagues - the plague of locusts - in Egypt, of which we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-6.htm">Exodus 10:6</a>, "Which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day they were upon the earth unto this day;" while the direction to have it transmitted by tradition seems an echo of what we read in the second verse of the same chapter: "That thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt." Similarly, it is written in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5, 6</a>, "He established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children: that the generation to come might know them, even the children which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children." The solemn manner in which the prophet draws attention to this by "Hear," "Give ear," and the earnestness with which he insists on the record of it being handed on from generation to generation,  are intended to impress on the people the work of God in this visitation, its severity, the sin that caused it, and the call to repentance conveyed by it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The allusion to whoredom leads to the description of the idolatrous conduct of the people in the third strophe, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11-14</a>, which is introduced with a general sentence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>. "Whoring and wine and new wine take away the heart (the understanding"). Zenu&#772;th is licentiousness in the literal sense of the word, which is always connected with debauchery. What is true of this, namely, that it weakens the mental power, shows itself in the folly of idolatry into which the nation has fallen. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-12.htm">Hosea 4:12</a>. "My nation asks its wood, and its stick prophesies to it: for a spirit of whoredom has seduced, and they go away whoring from under their God." &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493; is formed after &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, to ask for a divine revelation of the idols made of wood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-3.htm">Jeremiah 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-19.htm">Habakkuk 2:19</a>), namely, the teraphim (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm">Hosea 3:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>). This reproof is strengthened by the antithesis my nation, i.e., the nation of Jehovah, the living God, and its wood, the wood made into idols by the people. The next clause, "and its stick is showing it," sc. future events (higg&#305;&#772;d as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-22.htm">Isaiah 41:22-23</a>, etc.), is supposed by Cyril of Alexandria to refer to the practice of rhabdomancy, which he calls an invention of the Chaldaeans, and describes as consisting in this, that two rods were held upright, and then allowed to fall while forms of incantation were being uttered; and the oracle was inferred from the way in which they fell, whether forwards or backwards, to the right or to the left. The course pursued was probably similar to that connected with the use of the wishing rods.<p>(Note: According to Herod. iv. 67, this kind of soothsaying was very common among the Scythians (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-26.htm">Ezekiel 21:26</a>). Another description of rhabdomancy is described by Abarbanel, according to Maimonides and Moses Mikkoz: cf. Marck and Rosenmller on this passage.)<p>The people do this because a spirit of whoredom has besotted them.<p>By ru&#772;a&#774;ch zenu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m the whoredom is represented as a demoniacal power, which has seized upon the nation. Zenu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m probably includes both carnal and spiritual whoredom, since idolatry, especially the Asherah-worship, was connected with gross licentiousness. The missing object to &#1492;&#1514;&#1506;&#1492; may easily be supplied from the context. &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;, which differs from &#1494;&#1504;&#1492; &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>), signifies "to whore away from under God," i.e., so as to withdraw from subjection to God. </body></html>
