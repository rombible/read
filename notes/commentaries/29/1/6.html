He selected a word indicative of <span class= "ital">foreign</span> nations, suggestive of attack, including both the irrational invader and the foreign conqueror. The surpassing strength of the nation is indicated by the extraordinary power of the locust’s teeth, compared to that of the lion’s jaws. The same comparison is made by St. John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-8.htm" title="And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.">Revelation 9:8</a>): “Their teeth (the locusts) were as the teeth of lions.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/joel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm" title="For a nation is come up on my land, strong, and without number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the cheek teeth of a great lion.">Joel 1:6</a></span>. <span class="ital">For a nation is come up upon my land </span>— Insects are described as a nation or people marching in order under their leaders, both by sacred and profane writers, because of their power to do mischief, and their being irresistible by human strength or art. <span class="ital">Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion — </span>They devour every thing that comes in their way, and there is no possibility of rescuing it from them.

Armies of insects were coming upon the land to eat the fruits of it. It is expressed so as to apply also to the destruction of the country by a foreign enemy, and seems to refer to the devastations of the Chaldeans. God is Lord of hosts, has every creature at his command, and, when he pleases, can humble and mortify a proud, rebellious people, by the weakest and most contemptible creatures. It is just with God to take away the comforts which are abused to luxury and excess; and the more men place their happiness in the gratifications of sense, the more severe temporal afflictions are upon them. The more earthly delights we make needful to satisfy us, the more we expose ourselves to trouble.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For a nation is come up upon my land - He calls this scourge of God a "nation," giving them the title most used in Holy Scripture, of pagan nations. The like term, "people, folk," is used of the "ants" and the "conies" <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25-26</a>, for the wisdom with which God teaches them to act. Here it is used, in order to include at once, the irrational invader, guided by a Reason above its own, and the pagan conqueror. This enemy, he says, is "come up" (for the land as being God's land, was exalted in dignity, above other lands,) "upon My land," i. e. "the Lord's land" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-3.htm">Hosea 9:3</a>, hitherto owned protected as God's land, a land which, Moses said to them, "the Lord thy God careth for; the eyes of the Lord thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm">Deuteronomy 11:12</a>. Now it was to be bared of God's protection, and to be trampled upon by a pagan foe.<p>Strong and without number - The figure is still from the locust, whose numbers are wholly countless by man. Travelers sometimes use likenesses to express their number, as clouds darkening the sun (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>) or discharging flakes of snow ; some grave writers give it up, as hopeless. : "Their multitude is incredible, whereby they cover the earth and fill the air; they take away the brightness of the sun. I say again, the thing is incredible to one who has not seen them." "It would not be a thing to be believed, if one had not seen it." "On another day, it was beyond belief: they occupied a space of eight leagues (about 24 English miles). I do not mention the multitude of those without wings, because it is incredible." : "When we were in the Seignory of Abrigima, in a place called Aquate, there came such a multitude of locusts, as cannot be said. They began to arrive one day about terce (nine) and until night they cease not to arrive; and when they arrived, they bestowed themselves. On the next day at the hour of prime they began to depart, and at mid-day there was not one, and there remained not a leaf on the trees. At this instant others began to come, and staved like the others to the next day at the same hour; and these left not a stick with its bark, nor a green herb, and thus did they five days one after another; and the people said that they were the sons, who went to seek their fathers, and they took the road toward the others which had no wings. After they were gone, we knew the breadth which they had occupied, and saw the destruction which they had made, it exceeded three leagues (nine miles) wherein there remained no bark on the trees."<p>Another writes of South Africa ; "Of the innumerable multitudes of the incomplete insect or larva of the locusts, which at this time infested this part of Africa, no adequate idea could be conceived without having witnessed them. For the space of ten miles on each side of the Sea-Cow river, and eighty or ninety miles in length, an area of 16, or 1800 square miles, the whole surface might literally be said to be covered with them. The water of the river was scarcely visible on account of the dead carcasses which floated on the surface, drowned in the attempt to come at the weeds which grew in it." : "The present year is the third of their continuance, and their increase has far exceeded that of a geometrical progression whose whole ratio is a million." A writer of reputation says of a "column of locusts" in India ; "It extended, we were informed, 500 miles, and so compact was it when on the wing, that, like an eclipse, it completely hid the sun; so that no shadow was cast by any object, and some lofty tombs, not more than 200 yards distant, were rendered quite invisible."<p>In one single neighborhood, even in Germany, it was once calculated that near 17,000,000 of their eggs were collected and destroyed . Even Volney writes of those in Syria , "the quantity of these insects is a thing incredible to anyone who has not seen it himself; the ground is covered with them for several leagues." "The steppes," says Clarke , an incredulous traveler, "were entirely covered by their bodies, and their numbers falling resembled flakes of snow, carried obliquely by the wind, and spreading thick mists over the sun. Myriads fell over the carriage, the horses, the drivers. The Tartars told us, that persons had been suffocated by a fall of locusts on the "steppes." It was now the season, they added, in which they began to diminish." : "It was incredible, that their breadth was eight leagues."<p>Strong - The locust is remarkable for its long flights. "Its strength of limbs is amazing; when pressed down by the hand on the table, it has almost power to move the fingers" .<p>Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion - The teeth of the locust are said to be "harder than stone." : "They appear to be created for a scourge; since to strength incredible for so small a creature, they add saw-like teeth admirably calculated to "eat up all the herbs in the land."" Some near the Senegal, are described as  "quite brown, of the thickness and length of a finger, and armed with two jaws, toothed like a saw, and very powerful." The prophet ascribes to them the sharp or prominent eye-teeth of the lion and lioness, combining strength with number. The ideal of this scourge of God is completed by blending numbers, in which creatures so small only could exist together, with the strength of the fiercest. : "Weak and short-lived is man, yet when God is angered against a sinful people, what mighty power does He allow to man against it!" "And what more cruel than those who endeavor to slay souls, turning them from the Infinite and Eternal Good, and so dragging them to the everlasting torments of Hell?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. nation&#8212;applied to the locusts, rather than "people" (Pr 30:25, 26), to mark not only their numbers, but also their savage hostility; and also to prepare the mind of the hearer for the transition to the figurative locusts in the second chapter, namely, the "nation" or Gentile foe coming against Judea (compare Joe 2:2).<p>my land&#8212;that is, Jehovah's; which never would have been so devastated were I not pleased to inflict punishment (Joe 2:18; Isa 14:25; Jer 16:18; Eze 36:5; 38:16).<p>strong&#8212;as irresistibly sweeping away before its compact body the fruits of man's industry.<p>without number&#8212;so Jud 6:5; 7:12, "like grasshoppers (or "locusts") for multitude" (Jer 46:23; Na 3:15).<p>teeth &#8230; lion&#8212;that is, the locusts are as destructive as a lion; there is no vegetation that can resist their bite (compare Re 9:8).

The reference is partly to the strength of limb possessed by the locust, enabling it for instance to take long flights and to persevere incessantly in its work of destruction, partly to the irresistible numbers in which swarms of locusts are apt to invade a country.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">without number</span>] a characteristic of locust-swarms, often alluded to in the O.T.: <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm" title="He spoke, and the locusts came, and caterpillars, and that without number,">Psalm 105:34</a> (“and the <span class="ital">yéleḳ</span> without number”); and in comparisons <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm" title="For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their camels were without number: and they entered into the land to destroy it.">Jdg 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-12.htm" title="And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand by the sea side for multitude.">Jdg 7:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm" title="They shall cut down her forest, said the LORD, though it cannot be searched; because they are more than the grasshoppers, and are innumerable.">Jeremiah 46:23</a> (all of the <span class="ital">arbeh</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-14.htm" title="The LORD of hosts has sworn by himself, saying, Surely I will fill you with men, as with caterpillars; and they shall lift up a shout against you.">Jeremiah 51:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm" title="Set you up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars.">Jeremiah 51:27</a> (of the <span class="ital">yéleḳ</span>). Modern travellers speak often of the literally incalculable numbers in which locusts come. Thus an observer in South Africa writes, “For the space of 10 miles on each side of the Sea-Cow river, and 80–90 miles in breadth, an area of 16–1800 square miles, the whole surface might literally be said to be covered with them: the water of the river was scarcely visible on account of the dead carcases which floated on the surface, drowned in the attempt to come at the weeds which grew in it.” Again, in Cyprus, “the locusts lay swarming above a foot deep in several parts of the high road, and thousands were destroyed by the wheels of the carriage driving over them.” A writer in <span class="ital">Nature</span> (1889, p. 153) states “that a flight of locusts that passed over the Red Sea in Nov. 1889, was 2000 square miles in extent,” and upon the assumption that it was 48 miles square, half a mile deep, and contained 144 locusts, each weighing 16 oz., to a cubic foot, he calculated that it contained 24,420 billions of insects, and weighed 42,850 millions of tons. “A second similar, perhaps even larger flight, was seen passing in the same direction the next day. In Cyprus in 1881, up to the end of October, 1,600,000,000 egg-cases bad that season been collected and destroyed, each case containing a considerable number of eggs. By the end of the season over 1300 tons of eggs had been collected; and yet not less than 5,076,000,000 egg-cases were, it is believed, deposited in the island two years afterwards” (<span class="ital">Cambridge Nat. Hist.</span> v. 292).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his teeth</span>, &c.] the locust’s teeth are edged like a saw, and very powerful; hence, though infinitely smaller, they may for destructiveness be compared to those of a lion.

In this and the following verse the prophet explains the instrumentality by which that destruction would be brought about. The prophet, fully identifying himself with his countrymen, speaking in their name and as their representative, says "my land." Kimchi understands the suffix to "land," like "my vine" and "my fig tree" in the next verse, as referring either to the prophet himself or to the people of the land; while some refer it to Jehovah, the great Proprietor, who had given the land to his people for their inheritance while they observed his covenant and obeyed his commandments. The locusts ore called a <span class="accented">nation</span>, just as the "ants are a people not strong," and the "conies are" said to be "but a feeble folk." Kimchi lays that "every collection of living things is called a nation (<span class="accented">qoy</span>); accordingly the prophet applies 'nation' to the locust." Nor deem the weed  "nation" thus applied support the allegorical sense any more than the Homeric - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"Even as go the swarms</span> [<span class="implied">literally nations</span>]<br /><span class="accented">of closely thronging bees."</span> This army of locusts is characterized by the two qualities of strength and number. The preterite <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, though past, really refers to the future, to express the certain occurrence of what is predicted; so with <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span> in the following verse, of which Kimchi says, "The past is in place of the future;" and Aben Ezra more fully, "A thing that is decreed to take place is spoken of in the past." This army has peculiar weapons, yet nothing the less powerful. <span class="cmt_word">Whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the cheek-teeth of a great lion</span>; or, <span class="accented">lioness.</span> Different descriptive terms are applied to lions - the lion's whelp is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5bc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;</span>; the young lion, which, though young, is no longer a whelp, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e8;</span>; also the lion, from its <span class="accented">hoarseness</span> at a certain age, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x5b9;</span>; the lion, from its cry, is called by onomatopoeia, <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5bc;&#x5d0;</span>; the lion, from its <span class="accented">strength</span>, is called <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>; while the common name of a lion, derived probably from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, to pluck or tear, is <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d9;&#x5b5;&#x5d4;</span>. Having compared the invading locusts to an army powerful and countless, the prophet proceeds to speak of the weapons wielded by these warlike and hostile invaders. They are their teeth. While the common name for locust respects their multitude, the other names are of the nature of epithets, and all, as we have seen, derived from the vigour and voracity with which they use their teeth. Those teeth, so destructive, are compared to those of a lion and the molars or grinders of a great, stout, old lion or lioness, for the word has been translated in each of these ways. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A different turn is now given to the prophecy, viz., that if Israel would not desist from idolatry, Judah ought to beware of participating in the guilt of Israel; and with this the fourth strophe (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15-19</a>) is introduced, containing the announcement of the inevitable destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>. "If thou commit whoredom, O Israel, let not Judah offend! Come ye not to Gilgal, go not up to Bethaven, and swear ye not by the life of Jehovah." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to render one's self guilty by participating in the whoredom, i.e., the idolatry, of Israel. This was done by making pilgrimages to the places of idolatrous worship in that kingdom, viz., to Gilgal, i.e., not the Gilgal in the valley of the Jordan, but the northern Gilgal upon the mountains, which has been preserved in the village of Jiljilia to the south-west of Silo (Seilun; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>). In the time of Elijah and Elisha it was the seat of a school of the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-1.htm">2 Kings 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-38.htm">2 Kings 4:38</a>); but it was afterwards chosen as the seat of one form of idolatrous worship, the origin and nature of which are unknown (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-15.htm">Hosea 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a>). Bethaven is not the place of that name mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm">Joshua 7:2</a>, which was situated to the south-east of Bethel; but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-4.htm">Amos 4:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> clearly show, a name which Hosea adopted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm">Amos 5:5</a> for Bethel (the present Beitin), to show that Bethel, the house of God, had become Bethaven, a house of idols, through the setting up of the golden calf there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-29.htm">1 Kings 12:29</a>). Swearing by the name of Jehovah was commanded in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-2.htm">Jeremiah 4:2</a>); but this oath was to have its roots in the fear of Jehovah, to be simply an emanation of His worship. The worshippers of idols, therefore, were not to take it into their mouths. The command not to swear by the life of Jehovah is connected with the previous warnings. Going to Gilgal to worship idols, and swearing by Jehovah, cannot go together. The confession of Jehovah in the mouth of an idolater is hypocrisy, pretended piety, which is more dangerous than open ungodliness, because it lulls the conscience to sleep. </body></html>
