And by crying to God himself, he endeavours to stir up the people to cry to him. <span class="ital">For the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness — </span>The fiery drought hath burned up all the pasture-grounds. The wilderness is sometimes opposed to the hills and mountains, and then it signifies the plains and places for pasture. Or, if the expression be here understood of deserts, it must be observed, that there were spots in them where flocks and herds might feed. <span class="ital">The beasts of the field also cry unto thee — </span>Even the cattle and wild beasts utter their complaints, and express their want of food by the mournful noise which they make, as it were beseeching thee to have pity on them and relieve their wants. Even they have a voice to cry, as well as an eye to look to God. <span class="ital">The rivers of water are dried up — </span>The drought drying up the springs, the rivers have failed, and have little or no water in them. Thus, throughout the chapter, the prophet foretels a drought, as well as a plague of locusts; and these two calamities often go together, a great increase of locusts, according to Pliny and Bochart, being occasioned by heat. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/joel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:14-20 The sorrow of the people is turned into repentance and humiliation before God. With all the marks of sorrow and shame, sin must be confessed and bewailed. A day is to be appointed for this purpose; a day in which people must be kept from their common employments, that they may more closely attend God's services; and there is to be abstaining from meat and drink. Every one had added to the national guilt, all shared in the national calamity, therefore every one must join in repentance. When joy and gladness are cut off from God's house, when serious godliness decays, and love waxes cold, then it is time to cry unto the Lord. The prophet describes how grievous the calamity. See even the inferior creatures suffering for our transgression. And what better are they than beasts, who never cry to God but for corn and wine, and complain of the want of the delights of sense? Yet their crying to God in those cases, shames the stupidity of those who cry not to God in any case. Whatever may become of the nations and churches that persist in ungodliness, believers will find the comfort of acceptance with God, when the wicked shall be burned up with his indignation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/joel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, to Thee will I cry - This is the only hope left, and contains all hopes. From the Lord was the infliction; in Him is the healing. The prophet appeals to God by His own Name, the faithful Fulfiller of His promises, Him who Is, and who had promised to hear all who call upon Him. Let others call to their idols, if they would, or remain stupid and forgetful, the prophet would cry unto God, and that earnestly.<p>For the fire hath devoured the pastures - The gnawing of locusts leaves things, as though scorched by fire (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-3.htm">Joel 2:3</a>); the sun and the east wind scorch up all green things, as though it had been the actual contact of fire. Spontaneous combustion frequently follows. The Chaldees wasted all before them with fire and sword. All these and the like calamities are included under "the fire," whose desolating is without remedy. What has been scorched by fire never recovers . "The famine," it is said of Mosul, "was generally caused by fire spreading in dry weather over pastures, grass lands, and grain lands, many miles in extent. It burnt night and day often for a week and sometimes embraced the whole horizon." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/joel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. to thee will I cry&#8212;Joel here interposes, As this people is insensible to shame or fear and will not hear, I will leave them and address myself directly to Thee (compare Isa 15:5; Jer 23:9).<p>fire&#8212;that is, the parching heat.<p>pastures&#8212;"grassy places"; from a Hebrew root "to be pleasant."

The words might, however, be simply a poetical description of the ravages of the locusts themselves (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-3.htm" title="A fire devours before them; and behind them a flame burns: the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yes, and nothing shall escape them.">Joel 2:3</a><span class="ital"> a</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the pastures of the wilderness</span>] <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm" title="The beasts of the field cry also to you: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness.">Joel 1:20</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm" title="Be not afraid, you beasts of the field: for the pastures of the wilderness do spring, for the tree bears her fruit, the fig tree and the vine do yield their strength.">Joel 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-10.htm" title="For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourns; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right.">Jeremiah 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/65-12.htm" title="They drop on the pastures of the wilderness: and the little hills rejoice on every side.">Psalm 65:12</a>. “Wilderness” does not mean the desert: <span class="ital">midbâr</span> (properly, <span class="ital">a place for driving</span> cattle) denotes land which is unenclosed, and uncultivated, especially a broad prairie or steppe, but not land which is destitute of pasturage.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/joel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 19, 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">O Lord, to thee will I cry</span>. In consideration of man and beast - creatures rational and irrational being subject to so much hardship and suffering - the prophet appeals in intense earnestness of spirit to God, and all the more so because of the encouragement of his own Word, as it is written, "Lord, thou preservest man and beast." <span class="cmt_word">For the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field</span>. The fire and flame here referred to denote the fiery heat of the drought which burnt up the meadows and scorched the trees. Some seem to understand the terms literally, as applied to setting on fire the heath, or even the trees, in order to check the progress of the locusts or turn them aside by smoke and flame. This, however, is refuted by the following  verse, which mentions the rivers of water being dried up: The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness. In like manner we read in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-4.htm">Jeremiah 14:4-6</a>, "Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain in the earth, the ploughmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. Yea, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. And the wild asses did stand in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes did fail, because there was no grass." The various animals suffering from hunger and thirst express their distress in loud and lamentable, though inarticulate, cries. The Hebrew words which respectively denote the cries of the different animals are, according to Rashi, the following: <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5e8;&#x5d2;</span> expresses the cry of deer; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5d4;&#x5dd;</span> (also <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d0;&#x5d2;</span>), to roar like lions; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e2;&#x5d4;</span>, to low as oxen; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d7;&#x5dc;</span>, to neigh like horses; <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5d9;&#x5e4;&#x5e6;&#x5d5;&#x5e4;</span> (rather <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e6;&#x5b4;&#x5e4;</span>, fulfil), to twitter or chirp as birds.

The princes of Judah have become like boundary-movers; upon them I pour out my wrath like water." The kingdom of Israel will entirely succumb to the punishment. It will become a desert - will be laid waste not only for a time, but permanently. The punishment with which it is threatened will be &#1504;&#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;. This word is to be interpreted as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-59.htm">Deuteronomy 28:59</a>, where it is applied to lasting plagues, with which God will chastise the obstinate apostasy of His people.

Judah also will not escape the punishment of its sins. The unusual expression mass&#305;&#772;ge&#772; gebhu&#772;l is formed after, and to be explained from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>, "Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark;" or <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>, "Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark." The princes of Judah have become boundary-removers, not by hostile invasions of the kingdom of Israel (Simson); for the boundary-line between Israel and Judah was not so appointed by God, that a violation of it on the part of the princes of Judah could be reckoned a grievous crime, but by removing the boundaries of right which had been determined by God, viz., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>, by participating in the guilt of Ephraim, i.e., by idolatry, and therefore by the fact that they had removed the boundary between Jehovah and Baal, that is to say, between the one true God and idols. "If he who removes his neighbour's boundary is cursed, how much more he who removes the border of his God!" (Hengstenberg). Upon such men the wrath of God would fall in its fullest measure. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, like a stream of water, so plentifully. For the figure, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/69-25.htm">Psalm 69:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/79-6.htm">Psalm 79:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-25.htm">Jeremiah 10:25</a>. Severe judgments are thus announced to Judah, viz., those of which the Assyrians under Tiglath-pileser and Sennacherib were the instruments; but no ruin or lasting devastation is predicted, as was the case with the kingdom of Israel, which was destroyed by the Assyrians. </body></html>
