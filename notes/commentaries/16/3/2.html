No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The people of each provincial town were set to work for the most part on the portion of the wall nearest their city.

This distribution, by which the building was carried on in all parts simultaneously with great energy, was eminently favorable to despatch. "The villages where the restorers resided being mostly mentioned, it will be seen that this circumstance affords a general indication of the part of the wall upon which they labored, such places being on that side of the city nearest their place of abode; the only apparent exception being, perhaps, where they repaired more than their piece. Having completed their first undertaking (if they worked any more), there being no more work to be done on the side next their residence, or having arrived after the repairs on that part of the city nearest them under operation were completed, they would go wherever their services would be required" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The men of Jericho; </span> the posterity of the ancient inhabitants of Jericho.

As yet he had said nothing either to the Jews (the citizens of Jerusalem), the priests, the nobles, the rulers, or the rest who did the work. &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; are connected, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-2.htm">Ezra 9:2</a> &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;.

When these are, in comparison with the priests, nobles, and rulers, designated as &#1497;&#1514;&#1512;, the remnant, this is explained by the fact that the priests and rulers of the people were not actively engaged in building. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1492;, the work in question, i.e., here the building of the walls. &#1499;&#1468;&#1503; &#1506;&#1491;, until thus, i.e., until now, until the time apparent from the context. Nehemiah then, having inspected the condition of the ruined walls, and being now persuaded of the possibility of restoring them, made known his resolution to the nobles, the rulers, and the community, i.e., to a public assembly called together for this purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-17.htm">Nehemiah 2:17</a>). "Ye see (have before your eyes, know from experience) the distress that we are in, that Jerusalem lieth waste: come (&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;), let us build up the walls of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach." In other words: Let us by building our walls put an end to the miserable condition which gives our adversaries occasion to reproach us. </body></html>
