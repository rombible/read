No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bavai - Or, "Binnui" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-9.htm">Nehemiah 10:9</a>.<p>The armoury at the turning of the wall - literally, "the armoury of the corner."

Ezer has not been previously mentioned as repairing any portion of the wall; but "the men of Mizpah" have been mentioned as so doing (ver. 7). Ezer had apparently succeeded to "Jadon the Meronothita, as the superintendant of the Mizpah working-party. <span class="cmt_word">The going up to the armoury at the turning of the wall</span>. Literally, "the ascent to the armoury of the corner." There were probably several armouries in Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-8.htm">Isaiah 22:8</a>). This one was called "the armoury of the corner," being situated at the north-western angle of the special wall of the city of David. There was an "ascent" to it, either by steps, or by a steep pathway, from the Tyropoeon valley. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>From the valley-gate to the dung-gate. The valley-gate lay in the west, in the neighbourhood of the present Jaffa gate (see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-13.htm">Nehemiah 2:13</a>), "where," as Tobler, Topogr. i. p. 163, expresses it, "we may conclude there must almost always have been, on the ridge near the present citadel, the site in the time of Titus of the water-gate also (Joseph. bell. Jud. v. 7. 3), an entrance provided with gates." Hanun and the inhabitants of Zanoah are here connected, probably because Hanun was the chief or ruler of the inhabitants of this place. Zanoah, now Zanna, is in the Wady Ismail, west of Jerusalem; see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34</a>. They built and set up its doors, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a>. The further statement, "and a thousand cubits on the wall unto the dung-gate," still depends on &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, the principal verb of the verse. It is incomprehensible how Bertheau can say that this statement does not refer to the repairing of the wall, but only declares that the distance from the valley-gate to the dung-gate amounted to one thousand cubits. For the remark, that a section of such a length is, in comparison with the other sections, far too extensive, naturally proves nothing more than that the wall in this part had suffered less damage, and therefore needed less repair. The number one thousand cubits is certainly stated in round numbers. The length from the present Jaffa gate to the supposed site of the dung-gate, on the south-western edge of Zion, is above two thousand five hundred feet. The dung-gate may, however, have been placed at a greater distance from the road leading to Baher. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; is only another form for &#1492;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; (without &#1488; prosthetic). Malchiah ben Rechab, perhaps a Rechabite, built and fortified the dung-gate; for though the Rechabites were forbidden to build themselves houses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Jeremiah 35:7</a>), they might, without transgressing this paternal injunction, take part in building the fortifications of Jerusalem (Berth.). This conjecture is, however, devoid of probability, for a Rechabite would hardly be a prince or ruler of the district of Beth-haccerem. The name Rechab occurs as early as the days of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-5.htm">2 Samuel 4:5</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501;, i.e., the garden or vineyard-house, where, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>, the children of Benjamin were wont to set up a banner, and to blow the trumpet in Tekoa, is placed by Jerome (Comm. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6.htm">Jeremiah 6</a>) upon a hill between Jerusalem and Tekoa; on which account Pococke (Reise, ii. p. 63) thinks Beth-Cherem must be sought for on the eminence now known as the Frank mountain, the Dshebel Fureidis, upon which was the Herodium of Josephus. This opinion is embraced with some hesitation by Robinson (Pal. ii. p. 397), and unreservedly by Wilson (The Holy City, i. p. 396) and v. de Velde, because "when we consider that this hill is the highest point in the whole district, and is by reason of its isolated position and conical shape very conspicuous, we shall find that no other locality better corresponds with the passage cited. </body></html>
