No man can think, (as Pellicanus observes,) that the names of them who repaired the walls of Jerusalem were set down so diligently as here they are, without some rational cause for it. And the reason was, because it was a work of great <span class="ital">virtue, </span>to love and to do honour to their country; a work of <span class="ital">piety, </span>to restore the holy city; <span class="ital">a religious </span>conduct, to defend the true worshippers of God, that they might serve him in quietness and safety; and a <span class="ital">courageous </span>behaviour, in the midst of so many enemies, to go on with this work in a pious confidence of the power of God to support them. The names, therefore, of such persons deserved to be preserved and transmitted to future generations, as a most noble example to them. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-32 The rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem. - The work was divided, so that every one might know what he had to do, and mind it, with a desire to excel; yet without contention, or separate interests. No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gate Miphkad - Not elsewhere mentioned.

The names of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem are commemorated because it was a work of piety and patriotism to repair the holy city. It was an instance of religion and courage to defend the true worshippers of God, that they might serve Him in quietness and safety, and, in the midst of so many enemies, go on with this work, piously confiding in the power of God to support them [Bishop Patrick].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate,....

For, apart from the supply and repair of vessels, furniture, and dress, required for the daily ministration, the dedication of precious things would create a constant traffic close to the Temple. The merchants would establish themselves at the main approaches to the Temple and expose their wares to the throngs of worshippers and sacrificers who collected about this spot.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Unto the sheep gate</span>. Compare ver. 1. The circuit is completed, and the point reached from which the commencement was made. <span class="cmt_word">The goldsmiths and the merchants</span> were required to repair the piece of wall immediately to the south of the sheep gate, for which no individual had volunteered. Probably they had houses in the neighbourhood. They consented; and thus the entire wall was taken in hand, and the great work, which Nehemiah had conceived in his heart while still in Susa, was inaugurated. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Having now reached the place where the wall encloses Ophel, a remark is inserted, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, on the dwellings of Nethinim, i.e., of the temple servants. The Nethinim dwelt in Ophel as far as (the place) before the water-gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out. &#1492;&#1497; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; still depends upon &#1504;&#1490;&#1491; &#1506;&#1491;. The water-gate towards the east, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>, lay beyond the south-eastern corner of the temple area. Bertheau, reasoning upon the view that the open space of the house of God, where Ezra spoke to the assembled people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-9.htm">Ezra 10:9</a>), is identical with the open place before the water-gate mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>, places it on the east side of the temple area, near where the golden gate (Rab er Rahme) now stands. This identity, however, cannot be proved; and even if it could, it would by no means follow that this open space lay on the east side of the temple area. And as little does it follow from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm">Nehemiah 12:37</a>, as we shall show when we reach this passage. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; is said by Bertheau to have belonged perhaps to the water-gate towards the east, since, by reason of the statements contained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-32.htm">Nehemiah 3:32</a>, we must not seek it so far northwards on the east side of the temple area, as to combine it with the remains of a tower projecting seven and a half feet from the line of wall at the north-east corner, and described by Robinson (Biblical Researches, p. 226). But even if the tower in question must not be identified with these remains, it by no means follows that it stood in the neighbourhood of the golden gate. Even Arnold, in his work already cited, p. 636, remarks, in opposition to Bertheau's view, that "it is evident from the whole statement that the tower standing out from the king's house, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>, is one and the same, and that Bertheau's view of our having here three separate towers can hardly be maintained," although he, as well as Bertheau, transposes both the king's house and the court of the prison to the south of the Temple area. The similar appellation of this tower as &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; in the three verses speaks so decidedly for its identity, that very forcible reasons must be adduced before the opposite view can be adopted. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a> it is not a locality near the water-gate in the east which is indicted by &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;, but the western boundary of the dwellings of the Nethinim lying opposite. They dwelt, that is, upon Ophel, southwards of the temple area, on a tract of land reaching from the water-gate in the east to opposite the outstanding tower of the royal citadel in the west, i.e., from the eastern slope of the ridge of Ophel down to the Tyropoean valley.</body></html>
