No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beth-zur - Now Beit-sur, on the road from Jerusalem to Hebron <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a>.<p>By "the sepulchres of David" must be understood the burial place in which David and the kings his descendants to the time of Hezekiah were interred.

It commanded the road to Hebron and was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm" title="And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>). From the mention of it in this verse we may gather that it ranked as an important town on the Southern frontier. In the Maccabean Wars it appears as a strongly fortified place and the scene of three of the bloodiest conflicts (cf. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/4-29.htm" title="So they came into Idumea, and pitched their tents at Bethsura, and Judas met them with ten thousand men.">1Ma 4:29</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/11-65.htm" title="Then Simon encamped against Bethsura and fought against it a long season, and shut it up:...">1Ma 11:65-66</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/14-7.htm" title="And gathered together a great number of captives, and had the dominion of Gazera, and Bethsura, and the tower, out of the which he took all uncleanness, neither was there any that resisted him.">1Ma 14:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto</span> the place <span class="ital">over against the sepulchres of David</span>] This must have been a well-known spot opposite the tombs of the former kings of Judah. From the way in which these are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-33.htm" title="And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the most chief of the sepulchers of the sons of David: and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honor at his death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.">2 Chronicles 32:33</a> ‘they buried (Hezekiah) in the ascent of the sepulchres of the sons of David,’ they were probably on the side of the south-east or east cliff of Mt. Ophel. We may expect interesting discoveries to result from investigations instituted at this spot for the sake of identifying the royal sepulchres.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and to the pool that was made</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">and unto</span> &c. From this description of ‘the pool’ some have supposed that Nehemiah regarded it as a recent construction in his own time.

Cf. Sayce, ‘Traces of this have been found by Dr Guthe, close to the so-called tree of Isaiah; and since the city wall here formed one of the walls of the reservoir, the latter must have been constructed after the walls had been built.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the house of the mighty</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the house of the mighty men.</span> This name was probably given to the traditional site (or building on the site) of the former royal barracks erected by David for his ‘body-guard of mighty men’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And he cast stones at David, and at all the servants of king David: and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.">2 Samuel 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2 Samuel 23:8</a>). That it denotes the residence of the Temple guard (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-26.htm" title="For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house of God.">1 Chronicles 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-6.htm" title="Also to Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men of valor.">1 Chronicles 26:6</a>), is a less probable explanation of the name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Rabbi Saadiah understands by the expression ‘the Sanhedrin,’ who were mighty in the Law, and compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-20.htm" title="Bless the LORD, you his angels, that excel in strength, that do his commandments, hearkening to the voice of his word.">Psalm 103:20</a>, ‘ye mighty in strength that fulfil his word.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Nehemiah the son of Azbuk</span>.

It is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-58.htm">Joshua 15:58</a> among the cities of Judah, and appears to have become a place of considerable importance under the Maccabees (1 Maccabees 4:29 1 Maccabees 6:31-50 1 Maccabees 14:7; etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The</span> <span class="cmt_word">sepulchres of David</span> and the kings, his descendants, to the time of Hezekiah, were excavated in the rock upon which the temple stood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-7.htm">Ezekiel 43:7-9</a>), apparently on its western side. They have not hitherto been discovered.
