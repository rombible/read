No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The other piece - Rather, "another piece" (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-21.htm">Nehemiah 3:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-30.htm">Nehemiah 3:30</a>).

The latter is the more natural interpretation. There is this difficulty: whereas in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-21.htm" title="After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.">Nehemiah 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm" title="After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lies out, even to the wall of Ophel.">Nehemiah 3:27</a></span> we find the recurrence of names which have occurred earlier in the chapter (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/3-4.htm" title="And next to them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the son of Koz. And next to them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel.

Accordingly some commentators, laying stress on the point that in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/3-19.htm" title="And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armory at the turning of the wall....">Nehemiah 3:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm" title="After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner.">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm" title="After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against the great tower that lies out, even to the wall of Ophel.">Nehemiah 3:27</a></span> the phrase is accompanied by a minute topographical notice, maintain that the words do not imply a <span class="ital">second</span> piece of work, but a special <span class="ital">continuation</span> of the work just mentioned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the other hand, it should be observed that (1) Malchijah’s name at any rate recurs in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-31.htm" title="After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son to the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.">Nehemiah 3:31</a></span>; (2) in this portion of Nehemiah’s description ‘the gate of Ephraim’ is strangely altogether omitted, in spite of its great importance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>): (3) it is on other grounds very probable that the complete list of those engaged on the work of restoration has not been preserved, and that numerous names have been lost. A recognition of the incompleteness of the list will fully meet the difficulty presented in this verse, and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/3-19.htm" title="And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armory at the turning of the wall....">Nehemiah 3:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-24.htm" title="After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece, from the house of Azariah to the turning of the wall, even to the corner.">Nehemiah 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-30.htm" title="After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece.

It may have stood a little to the N. of the modern citadel. It was the fortress of the N.W. angle of the city, and probably constituted the chief fortification in connexion with the corner gate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-9.htm" title="Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate, and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and fortified them.">2 Chronicles 26:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.">Jeremiah 31:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Malchijah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Hashub</span>, who are here said to have repaired, not <span class="cmt_word">the other piece</span>, but "a second piece"of the wall, have not been previously mentioned in our present text; whence it has been concluded with reason (Bertheau) that the text is defective, some whole verses having fallen out (comp. ver. 20). <span class="cmt_word">The tower of the furnaces</span> is mentioned again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm">Nehemiah 12:38</a>.

Meremoth ben Urijah repaired, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-21.htm">Nehemiah 3:21</a>, another portion besides. Meshullam ben Berechiah was, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm">Nehemiah 6:18</a>, a person of consideration in Jerusalem. The men of Tekoa, who do not occur among those who returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>), also repaired a second portion. "But their nobles brought not their neck to the service of their Lord." The expression "to bring the neck to service" is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-11.htm">Jeremiah 27:11</a>, to be understood as meaning: to bring the neck under the yoke of any one, i.e., to subject oneself to the service of another. &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; stands for &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501;. It is questionable whether &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; is to be taken as the plural of excellence, and understood of God, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-17.htm">Deuteronomy 10:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-3.htm">Psalm 135:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>; or of earthly lords or rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-1.htm">Genesis 40:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-3.htm">2 Samuel 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-27.htm">1 Kings 12:27</a>. The former view seems to us decidedly correct, for it cannot be discerned how the suffix should (according to Bertheau's opinion) prevent our thinking of the service of God, if the repairing of the wall of Jerusalem may be regarded as a service required by God and rendered to Him. Besides, the fact that &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is only used of kings, and is inapplicable whether to the authorities in Jerusalem or to Nehemiah, speaks against referring it to secular rulers or authorities. </body></html>
