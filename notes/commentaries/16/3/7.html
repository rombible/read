No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the throne ... - The meaning is thought to be "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who, though they worked for Nehemiah, were not under his government, but belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor on this side the river." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. next unto him builded the men of Jericho, &c.&#8212;The wall was divided into portions, one of which was assigned respectively to each of the great families which had returned from the captivity. This distribution, by which the building was carried on in all parts simultaneously with great energy, was eminently favorable to despatch. "The villages where the restorers resided being mostly mentioned, it will be seen that this circumstance affords a general indication of the part of the wall upon which they labored, such places being on that side of the city nearest their place of abode; the only apparent exception being, perhaps, where they repaired more than their piece. Having completed their first undertaking (if they worked any more), there being no more work to be done on the side next their residence, or having arrived after the repairs on that part of the city nearest them under operation were completed, they would go wherever their services would be required" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. Unto the place where the governor of the country on this side the river Euphrates, for and under the Persian kings, sometimes had a palace or throne, to which all persons living in the adjacent parts were to resort for judgment. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon and Mizpah,....

Melatiah is thus at the head of the Gibeonites, Jadon at the head of the men of Mizpah. But as the latter is called ‘the Meronothite’ (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-30.htm" title="Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:">1 Chronicles 27:30</a>), we conclude that Meronoth, his native place, must have been a village in the immediate neighbourhood of Mizpah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The men of Gibeon are included in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-25.htm" title="The children of Gibeon, ninety and five.">Nehemiah 7:25</a> among those who returned with Zerubbabel (see the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-20.htm" title="The children of Gibbar, ninety and five.">Ezra 2:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mizpah, about 3½ miles N. of Jerusalem, the modern Nebi-Samwil.

(<span class="ital">a</span>) According to the rendering of the A.V., it denotes the limit of the restoration undertaken by the men mentioned in this verse. ‘The throne of the governor, &c.’ will then be the official residence of the Persian satrap or the actual throne in which he sate dispensing justice. The preposition ‘unto’ may be understood to mean, <span class="ital">either</span> that the governor’s house was built on the wall, and that the restoration mentioned in this verse reached this point; <span class="ital">or</span> that the governor’s ‘throne’ was in the vicinity, and the restoration was carried on to a point over against it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The chief objection to this rendering is the use of the word ‘throne.’ But it is more simple than the alternative rendering given below. And the supposition is very natural, that an official spot, close to the chief northern gate of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm" title="Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:6</a>), should become a recognised landmark. The visit of the satrap of the country W. of the Euphrates to the provincial capitals would be a rare event; and the spot which symbolised his dignity would receive a distinctive name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) According to the rendering of the R.V., the clause is added by way of limitation after the mention of Mizpah. Mizpah it is supposed was partly under Jewish rulers (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm" title="But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king's garden, and to the stairs that go down from the city of David.">Nehemiah 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm" title="And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armory at the turning of the wall.">Nehemiah 3:19</a></span>), partly under the rule of the Persian provincial governor. The boundary passed through the district of Mizpah. ‘The men of Mizpah,’ mentioned here, represented the portion under Persian rule, in which perhaps the village of Maronoth was included. By the indulgence of the Persian rulers (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-7.htm" title="Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;">Nehemiah 2:7</a>) a contingent was permitted to render aid to their brethren.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The phrase ‘the throne of the governor beyond the river’ will then be a <span class="ital">technical</span> term of authority in vogue among the Jews during the Persian supremacy. ‘Throne’ in the sense of ‘rule’ is poetical, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-29.htm" title="His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.">Psalm 89:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm" title="His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun before me.">Psalm 89:36</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is nothing to be said in favour of another proposed rendering ‘in the name of the governor, &c.’ The Vulgate renders ‘pro duce,’ the LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἕως θρόνου τοῦ ἄρχοντος</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gibeon</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Mispah</span> lay due north of Jerusalem, at the distance respectively of about 5.5 and 4.5 miles The inhabitants were set to repair the middle part of the north wall<span class="cmt_word">.

Others translate - "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor across the river." But this can scarcely have been the fact, since Gibeon is mentioned among the re-occupied cities in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-25.htm">Nehemiah 7:25</a>, and if Bethel was Jewish, as we know that it was from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-31.htm">Nehemiah 11:31</a>, Gibeon and Mizpah, which were nearer Jerusalem, cannot have remained Syrian. Altogether, there is no reason to dispute the commonly received rendering, since Nehemiah again uses <span class="hebrew">&#x5dc;</span> for <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5d3;</span> in ver. 32, and the governor of Syria may well have had a "throne," or tribunal, at Jerusalem, which was usually under his jurisdiction, though exempted from his authority under the existing <span class="accented">regime</span>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The narrative of the building is connected with what precedes by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501;, which alludes to the carrying out of the resolve, &#1504;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-18.htm">Nehemiah 2:18</a>. The enumeration begins with Eliashib the high priest and his brethren, i.e., the ordinary priests. These built the sheep-gate, rightly sought by modern topographers in the eastern wall north of Haram, the site of the ancient temple, i.e., in the position or neighbourhood of the present St. Stephen's gate, through which the Bedouins to this day drive sheep into the town for sale (Tobler, Topogr. i. p. 149). "Although," as Bertheau remarks, "we are not generally justified, after the lapse of so many centuries, during which great changes have been made in the positions of the gates and walls, and in face of the fact that the present walls and gates were not erected till the years 1536, 1537, and 1539, in determining the direction and extent of the walls between the several gates, and the locality of the gates in this description, by the direction and extent of the wall and the locality of the gates in modern Jerusalem (Tobl. Topogr. Dritte Wanderung, p. 265), yet in the present instance valid arguments exist in favour of this view. The very neighbourhood of the temple and the nature of the soil bear witness that from ancient times a gate was placed here which took its name from the circumstance that sheep were driven in by it, whether for sale in the market or for sacrificial purposes." <p>(Note: In the neighbourhood of this gate was the pool of Bethesda (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm">John 5:2</a>), i.e., either the present Birket Israel or Birket es Serain, south of St. Stephen's gate (Tobler, Denkbltter, p. 53f., and Dritte Wanderung, p. 221), or the Struthion pool mentioned by Josephus, bell.

The setting up of the doors in the gates did not, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>, take place till after all the breaches in the wall had been repaired, i.e., till the building of the wall was completed. It is, however, mentioned here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a>, etc., contemporaneously with the wall-building; because the builders of the several gates, undertaking also the construction and setting up of the doors, the intention is to give a summary of the work executed by the respective building parties. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; is still dependent on &#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, that is to say, this verb must be mentally repeated before the words: they built to the tower Hammeah, they sanctified it (the suffix in &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; can only relate to &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500;). &#1497;&#1489;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; must also be repeated before &#1495;&#1504;&#1504;&#1488;&#1500; &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1491;: and they built further, unto the tower Hananeel. The tower &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; (the hundred) is only mentioned here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm">Nehemiah 12:39</a>, but the tower Hananeel is likewise spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm">Zechariah 14:10</a>. From these passages it appears that the two towers were so situated, that any one going from west to east along the north wall of the city, and thence southward, would first come to the tower Hananeel, and afterwards to the tower Hammeah, and that both were between the fish-gate and the sheep-gate. From the passages in Jeremiah and Zechariah especially, it is evident that the tower Hananeel stood at the north-east corner of the wall. Hence the statement in this verse, that the portion of wall built by the priests extended to the north-east corner of the wall; and the tower Hammeah must be sought between the sheep-gate and the north-east corner of the wall. Whence the names of these towers were derived is unknown.</body></html>
