Ophel was the long rounded spur running out south of the Temple, on the sides of which the ancient “temple servants” still dwelt, separated from others, on a tract of land reaching from the “water-gate toward the east” to the outlying tower of the king’s citadel in the west. Nothing is said of their part in the general labour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/nehemiah/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm" title="Moreover the Nethinims dwelled in Ophel, to the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that lies out.">Nehemiah 3:26</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Nethinims dwelt in Ophel — </span>Or, <span class="ital">who dwelt in Ophel. </span>For this seems to be only a description of the persons whose work follows.

No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The marginal reading is better.

The names of those who repaired the walls of Jerusalem are commemorated because it was a work of piety and patriotism to repair the holy city. It was an instance of religion and courage to defend the true worshippers of God, that they might serve Him in quietness and safety, and, in the midst of so many enemies, go on with this work, piously confiding in the power of God to support them [Bishop Patrick].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Dwelt in Ophel, </span> or, <span class="ital">who dwelt in Ophel</span>; for this seems to be only a description of the persons, whose work follows. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The water-gate; </span> so called because by that gate water was brought in, either by the people for the use of that part of the city, or rather by these Nethinims, who were Gibeonites, for the uses of the temple, for which they were <span class="ital">drawers of water</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-21.htm" title="And the princes said to them, Let them live; but let them be hewers of wood and drawers of water to all the congregation; as the princes had promised them.">Joshua 9:21</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover, the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel,....

The wall of ‘Ophel’ was built on by Jotham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/27-3.htm" title="He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the wall of Ophel he built much.">2 Chronicles 27:3</a>). And the ‘hill’ was surrounded by a wall in Manasseh’s reign, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-14.htm" title="Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced cities of Judah.">2 Chronicles 33:14</a>. ‘Ophel’ means ‘a mound,’ and was the name applied to the S. continuance of the Temple hill.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">over against the water gate toward the east</span>] Between the Temple and the water gate there seems to have been a large open space in which the people could assemble (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm" title="And he read therein before the street that was before the water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were attentive to the book of the law.">Nehemiah 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm" title="And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.">Nehemiah 12:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-9.htm" title="Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves together to Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of this matter, and for the great rain.">Ezra 10:9</a>). The houses of the Nethinim approached or abutted on the city wall at this point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘water gate’ was obviously so called because the path leading from the spring of Gihon, the Virgin’s Spring, entered the city here. Water-carriers passing in and out gave the gate its name. On Gihon, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-33.htm" title="The king also said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon:">1 Kings 1:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1 Kings 1:38</a>. It is “the one spring of Jerusalem, known as the Virgin’s Fountain to Christians, and as ‘the Mother of Steps’ to Moslems, because of the steps which lead down into the vault from the present surface of the valley” (Conder’s <span class="ital">Palestine</span>, p. 26).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From here the wall led northward or north-eastward to ‘the corner’ (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-31.htm" title="After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son to the place of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.">Nehemiah 3:31</a></span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the tower that lieth out</span>] Probably the same as that mentioned in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm" title="Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lies out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison.

Ophel was "the long, narrowish, rounded spur or promontory which intervenes between the central valley of Jerusalem (the Tyropoeon) and the Kidron, or Valley of Jehoshaphat" (Grove). The Nethinims, who had their dwellings on this spur, were set to fortify a portion of the eastern circuit, but apparently restored not so much their own wall as that which lay north of it, at the edge of the present Haram area. Here must have been <span class="cmt_word">the water gate</span>, which carried off the superfluous water from the temple reservoirs; and here was <span class="cmt_word">the great tower that lieth out</span>, whose foundations have been recently discovered.

But the reason he adduces, viz., that often as the word &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511; occurs in this description, a further definition is nowhere else added to it, speaks as much against, as for his proposed alteration; definitions of locality never, throughout the entire narrative, preceding &#1492;&#1495;&#1494;&#1497;&#1511;, but uniformly standing after it, as also in the present verse. Certainly &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492; cannot here mean either to be angry, or to be incensed, but may without difficulty be taken, in the sense of the Tiphal &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1492;, to emulate, to contend (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-15.htm">Jeremiah 22:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-5.htm">Jeremiah 12:5</a>), and the perfect adverbially subordinated to the following verb (comp.
