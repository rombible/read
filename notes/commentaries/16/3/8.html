No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto the throne ... - The meaning is thought to be "the men of Gibeon and Mizpah, who, though they worked for Nehemiah, were not under his government, but belonged to the jurisdiction of the governor on this side the river." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. they fortified Jerusalem unto the broad wall&#8212;or, "double wall," extending from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits in length, formerly broken down by Joash, king of Israel [2Ch 25:23], but afterwards rebuilt by Uzziah [2Ch 26:9], who made it so strong that the Chaldeans, finding it difficult to demolish, had left it standing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is not said <span class="ital">they repaired</span>, as was said of the rest, but they <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">fortified</span> it, either because this part of the wall was less demolished than the other, and therefore they needed not to repair it, but only to make it stronger by some additions; or to note their extraordinary care and diligence, that they would not only repair it, and restore it to its former state, but make it stronger than ever it was; which also might be fit to be done in that part of the city. Others render it <span class="ital">they left</span>, as this word commonly signifies; and so the meaning is, They omitted the building of that part of the wall, because it remained standing; this being that space of four hundred cubits which was pulled down by Joash king of Israel, and rebuilt by Uzziah, who made it so strong, that the Chaldeans could not pull it down without more trouble than they thought fit to employ about it.

The R.V. gives the meaning of the Hebrew, which is literally ‘Hananiah, a son of the apothecaries or perfumers.’ This Hananiah, possibly ‘the son of Shelemiah’ mentioned as engaged in restoring another portion of the wall, represented the guild of ‘perfumers.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word ‘apothecary,’ which appears in the A.V. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-25.htm" title="And you shall make it an oil of holy ointment, an ointment compound after the are of the apothecary: it shall be an holy anointing oil.">Exodus 30:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-35.htm" title="And you shall make it a perfume, a confection after the are of the apothecary, tempered together, pure and holy:">Exodus 30:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/37-29.htm" title="And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.">Exodus 37:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-1.htm" title="Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking smell: so does a little folly him that is in reputation for wisdom and honor.">Ecclesiastes 10:1</a>, is not used in the sense of a vendor of medicines.

But even if this meaning be accepted, it is not easy to account for the occurrence of the words ‘fortified Jerusalem’ in the middle of a description, the whole of which deals with the fortification of Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) Accepting the usual rendering ‘left,’ the following explanations have been given:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) ‘And they’, i.e. the Babylonian troops, at the destruction of Jerusalem, had left this portion untouched. This translation introduces an imaginary subject, i.e. the Babylonians. It fails to explain the introduction of the reference to Jerusalem. It makes ‘left’ equivalent to ‘left undestroyed.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The Jews who were engaged upon the work of restoration ‘left untouched’ this portion of the wall, which happened not to require rebuilding. This again gives an arbitrary meaning to the word ‘left,’ and the mention of ‘Jerusalem’ remains unexplained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) They carried on the fortification at some distance from the dwelling-places of Jerusalem. The city wall extended further north than the houses. The builders ‘left the city,’ i.e. the neighbourhood of the houses, in order to complete the circumvallation included in the plan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) ‘And the Jews had abandoned Jerusalem,’ i.e. Jerusalem was at this point not occupied by the Jews returned from the Captivity. The northern limit of the inhabited quarter did not extend so far as it had done in the Monarchy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">e</span>) It is possible that the builders at this point ‘left’ some portion of Jerusalem <span class="ital">outside</span> their wall. The circumference of the old city was larger than was now needed. In the course of the restoration of the wall the builders abandoned at some point the old outer wall and the uninhabited portion of Jerusalem which it included.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The exact meaning lies hid in the topographical allusion, which we cannot hope to understand. It seems most natural, (1) that the subject to the verb ‘left’ should be the builders just previously mentioned; (2) that ‘Jerusalem’ should imply the inhabited city. The solution offered by (<span class="ital">e</span>) seems to be the most probable. The new circumvallation was, as a rule, larger than the old. Here only where the builders went <span class="ital">inside</span> and left the old wall, it is expressly mentioned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the broad wall</span>] The broad wall is mentioned again in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm" title="And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;">Nehemiah 12:38</a> as between ‘the tower of the furnaces’ and ‘the gate of Ephraim.’ The name was probably given to a portion of the wall where the thickness and strength of the structure indicated the strategic importance of this point in the fortifications. It is possible that this was the portion of 400 cubits which Amaziah pulled down (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-13.htm" title="And Jehoash king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Jehoash the son of Ahaziah, at Bethshemesh, and came to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2 Kings 14:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-23.htm" title="And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought him to Jerusalem, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.">2 Chronicles 25:23</a>) with the view of rendering Jerusalem defenceless on the N., and that this was the portion which Hezekiah took pains to strengthen and renew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm" title="Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made darts and shields in abundance.">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span>- <span class="cmt_word">Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries</span>.
