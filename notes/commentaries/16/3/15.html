No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "pool of Siloah" lies at the southwestern foot of the temple hill, near the lower end of the Tyropoeon.

According to the old view, Nehemiah’s description here passes over a considerable space (nearly half a mile in straight line) between the ‘dung gate’ and the ‘fountain gate.’ The omission is capable of being explained as due either to the omission of certain details, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-11.htm" title="Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab, repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.">Nehemiah 3:11</a>, or to the fact that the precipitous nature of the ground rendered little work necessary upon the southern wall. But it can hardly be accidental that a similar omission has to be understood in the other description of the wall’s circuit (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-31.htm" title="Then I brought up the princes of Judah on the wall, and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand on the wall toward the dung gate:">Nehemiah 12:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm" title="And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). It seems reasonable to incline to the recent suggestion, that, ‘the valley’ of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-13.htm" title="The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the wall to the dung gate.">Nehemiah 3:13</a>, being the Tyropœon, the circuit of the fortification wall did not include the Western Hill, but ran directly S. down the E. side of ‘the valley’ as far as ‘the dung gate’, when it began to deflect eastward.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Shallun</span>] The A.V. (1611) spelling ‘Shallum’ is perhaps due to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-12.htm" title="And next to him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.">Nehemiah 3:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the ruler of part of Mizpah</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the ruler of the district of Mizpah.</span> A distinction is drawn between the town of Mizpah and the adjacent district. Cf. ‘the district of Jerusalem,’ <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-9.htm" title="And next to them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-12.htm" title="And next to him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.">Nehemiah 3:12</a></span>. ‘The ruler of Mizpah’ itself is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm" title="And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armory at the turning of the wall.">Nehemiah 3:19</a>. See also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-7.htm" title="And next to them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, to the throne of the governor on this side the river.">Nehemiah 3:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">covered it</span>] The word so rendered does not occur elsewhere in the Bible. The LXX. renders <span class="greekheb">ἐστέγασεν</span>. It seems to correspond to the expression ‘laid the beams thereof’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-3.htm" title="But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm" title="Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.">Nehemiah 3:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the wall of the pool of Siloah by the king’s garden</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">And the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king’s garden.</span> Marg. ‘In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-6.htm" title="For as much as this people refuses the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;">Isaiah 8:6</a>, <span class="ital">Shiloah</span>’. On Siloam (= <span class="ital">Birket Silwân</span>), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-7.htm" title="And said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, (which is by interpretation, Sent.) He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing.">John 9:7</a>. ‘The pool of Shelah,’ or of ‘leading,’ is fed by a subterranean channel leading from the Virgin’s Spring, distant 1708 feet, through the Ophel rock. The connexion was discovered by Sir Charles Warren. The tunnel is a remarkable piece of engineering. On the very ancient inscription describing its construction which was found in 1880, see Sayce’s <span class="ital">Fresh Lights</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The pool here mentioned is probably the same as the lower pool, the modern ‘Birket el Hamra.’ The water from the pool flowed through ‘the king’s garden.’ The old city wall extended much further south than the modern city. The pool was formed by a heavy dam of masonry, probably part of the city wall. ‘The king’s garden’ is mentioned also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2 Kings 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-4.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate between the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 39:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-7.htm" title="Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth out of the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city round about:) and they went by the way of the plain.">Jeremiah 52:7</a>. We cannot conclude for certain from this verse that it was included within the walls. But the water supply of the town depending largely upon the pool, the pool was probably enclosed by the wall. The double walls mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm" title="And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.">2 Kings 25:4</a> probably protected both pool and gardens.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and unto the stairs</span>, &c.] R.V. <span class="bld">even unto the stairs</span>, &c. These ‘stairs’ mark the limit of Shallum’s work in a northerly direction. The ‘stairs’ were the steps ascending the steep declivity of the ‘Ophel’ or southern spur of Mt. Zion, on the eastern side of the city, and leading to the ‘water gate’ mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm" title="And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the street that was before the water gate; and they spoke to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which the LORD had commanded to Israel.">Nehemiah 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm" title="So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one on the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim.">Nehemiah 8:16</a>, above ‘the house of David’ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-37.htm" title="And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even to the water gate eastward.">Nehemiah 12:37</a>). See Sayce, p. 87. ‘Remains of these stairs have been discovered by Schick and Guthe a little to the east of the Pool of Siloam, as well as a little to the south of the Virgin’s Spring (but within the line of the old wall), so that they must have run up the eastern slope of Zion, and ended not very far from the square in front of the watergate.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the city of David</span>] The ‘city of David’ was the name given to the fortress captured by David, known as Zion. Its locality has been much disputed. (1) General tradition has identified it with the southern extremity of the western hill; (2) recently Conder and Warren have assigned it to the northern elevated portion of the same hill; (3) there is, however, good reason for identifying it with ‘the Temple hill.’ This last view is favoured by the language of the O. T. associating Zion with the dwelling or Temple of Jehovah. The present context almost conclusively proves that the ‘city of David’ lay on the eastern or Temple Hill.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The gate of the fountain</span>.
