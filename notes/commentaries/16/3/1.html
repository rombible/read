No strife appears among them, but which should do most for the public good. Every Israelite should lend a hand toward the building up of Jerusalem. Let not nobles think any thing below them, by which they may advance the good of their country. Even some females helped forward the work. Some repaired over against their houses, and one repaired over against his chamber. When a general good work is to be done, each should apply himself to that part which is within his reach. If every one will sweep before his own door, the street will be clean; if every one will mend one, we shall all be mended. Some that had first done helped their fellows. The walls of Jerusalem, in heaps of rubbish, represent the desperate state of the world around, while the number and malice of those who hindered the building, give some faint idea of the enemies we have to contend with, while executing the work of God. Every one must begin at home; for it is by getting the work of God advanced in our own souls that we shall best contribute to the good of the church of Christ. May the Lord thus stir up the hearts of his people, to lay aside their petty disputes, and to disregard their worldly interests, compared with building the walls of Jerusalem, and defending the cause of truth and godliness against the assaults of avowed enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Eliashib (compare the marginal reference) was the grandson of Joshua, the high priest contemporary with Zerubbabel.<p>The sheep gate - This was a gate in the eastern wall, not far from the pool of Bethesda, marginal reference, which was perhaps originally a sheep-pool.<p>The exact line which the writer follows in describing the circuit of the wall will probably be always a matter of dispute. According to the view here taken, the line described commences near the pool of Bethesda, on the east of the city, and is traced thence, first, northward, then westward, then southward, and finally eastward, as far as the pool of Siloam <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. From this point, it seems to the writer of this note that the line of the outer wall is not followed, but, instead of this, the inner wall of the "city of David," which included the temple, is traced. This wall is followed northward from the pool of Siloam, past the "sepulchres of David" and Hezekiah's pool to the "armoury" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-19.htm">Nehemiah 3:19</a> at its northwest corner; it is then followed eastward to "the tower which lieth out from the king's house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm">Nehemiah 3:25</a>; from this it is carried southward, along the western edge of the Kidron valley to the "great tower which lieth out" <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>, and then southwestward to the point at which it commenced near Siloam <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>. The special wall of the "city of David" being thus completed, the writer finishes his entire account by filling up the small interval between the northeast angle of this fortification and the "sheep-gate" <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28-32</a>, from which he started.<p>They sanctified it - The priests commenced the work with a formal ceremony of consecration. When the work was completed, there was a solemn dedication of the entire circuit (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>).<p>The tower of Hananeel is often mentioned; that of Meah, or rather Hammeah, or "the Hundred," in Nehemiah only. Both towers must have been situated toward the northeastern corner of the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Ne 3:1-32.

This was the grandson of Jeshua or Joshua the high priest, his father's name was Joiakim, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a>, being high priest, and rising first, he set a good example both to the priests and to the people, and served no doubt greatly to animate and encourage them: <p>and they built the sheep gate; so called, because the sheep were led through it to the temple, and near it was the sheep market, where they were sold, and the sheep pool, where the sacrifices were washed; and this being near the temple, and for the service of it, the priests undertook that; not that they laboured with their hands at it, though it is possible some of them might; but they were at the expense of it, employed labourers, and paid them, and directed them, and had the oversight of them: this gate was to the south of the city; and Rauwolff (u) says, it was still standing by Moriah, the mountain of the temple, which the Turks have taken to themselves, and built on it a Turkish mosque or temple. Near the gate you see still, he says, the sheep pond, which is large and deep, wherein the Nethinims used to wash the beasts, and then gave them to the priests; it is said (w) to lead to the mount of Olives, to Bethany, to Jericho, the desert, and all the east country to Jordan: <p>they sanctified it; this being for sacred use, and they sacred persons; and this the first part of the building, they prayed for a blessing on it, and in it on the whole work undertaken, of which this was the firstfruits: <p>and set up the doors of it; and so finished it: <p>even unto the tower of Meah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel; so far they built, and what they built they sanctified. The tower of Meah, or a "hundred", as the word signifies, might be so called, either because it was one hundred cubits from the sheep gate on one side, and as many from the tower of Hananeel on the other side, standing between both; or because it was one hundred cubits high: these two towers, perhaps, were firm and strong, and needed no repair, since no mention is made of any; though they seem to me to be one and the same tower; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm">Jeremiah 31:38</a>. <p>(u) Travels, par. 3. c. 3. p. 226, 228.

There can be little doubt that it is the same gate as that mentioned by St <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-2.htm" title="Now there is at Jerusalem by the sheep market a pool, which is called in the Hebrew tongue Bethesda, having five porches.">John 5:2</a>, ‘Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda.’ The fact that the priests restored it suggests its proximity to the Temple. This is confirmed by the reference to it in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>. Its position was in the N.E. portion of the city, and corresponded to the modern St Stephen’s gate, so far as the change in walls and ground-level permits of comparison. We may suppose that the name was taken from a sheep-market in the immediate neighbourhood. Large numbers of sheep would be required for the Temple sacrifices. The chief supplies of sheep would come from Eastern Palestine and the land of Moab. Their arrival through this eastern gate, whether a market stood near or not, was sufficient to account for the name.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Socin (Baedeker, <span class="ital">Palestine and Syria</span>, p. 151) says ‘As the pool of Bethesda is now believed to have been near the present ‘Ain esh-Shifâ,’ and not at the place assigned to it by tradition, we must inter that the sheep gate led from the industrial quarter of the Tyropœon into the Temple precincts.’ Comparing, however, this passage with <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>, it is tempting to identify ‘the sheep gate’ with ‘the gate of Benjamin,’ which is not mentioned in our chapter, but which clearly stood at the N.E. of the city (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-13.htm" title="And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, You fall away to the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 37:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they sanctified it</span>] The same Hebrew word occurs in connexion with the completion of a building in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm" title="The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.">1 Kings 8:64</a>, ‘The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court.’ It does not anticipate the solemn dedication of the walls in chap. 12. The completion of the priests’ work was signalised by a special sacred function. (See note on the word ‘sanctify’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm" title="And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things to the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them to the children of Aaron.">Nehemiah 12:47</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">set up the doors</span>] This was the final act. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm" title="In his days did Hiel the Bethelite build Jericho: he laid the foundation thereof in Abiram his firstborn, and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the LORD, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun.">1 Kings 16:34</a>, where ‘gates’ is kept by the R.V. as the rendering of the same word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the tower of Meah</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">unto the tower of Hammeah.</span> Marg., <span class="ital">unto the tower of ‘The hundred.’</span> What is intended by ‘the tower of Hammeah,’ we have no means of determining. The alternative rendering ‘the tower of The hundred,’ supposes either that the tower was approached by 100 steps, or that it required 100 men to defend it. It is possible that there has been some early defect in the reading.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they sanctified it</span>] The repetition of these words shows that the wall running from the sheep gate to the tower is here intended. But the omission of the object to the verb creates a difficulty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">unto the tower of Hananeel</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Hananel.</span> This was a well-known building, which is mentioned also in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-39.htm" title="And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even to the sheep gate: and they stood still in the prison gate.">Nehemiah 12:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-38.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner.">Jeremiah 31:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-10.htm" title="All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited in her place, from Benjamin's gate to the place of the first gate, to the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel to the king's winepresses.">Zechariah 14:10</a>. From the first of these passages we gather that the tower stood midway between the sheep gate and the fish gate. From the two others, that it stood at the N.E. corner of the city. Probably from this point the wall, which had run N.W., now turned due W. It may have owed its name to its builder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The way in which it is mentioned here occasions some difficulty. If it is the same as the tower of Hammeah, there seems no reason why the writer should first of all have designated the well-known tower of Hananel by the name of Hammeah. If it is a different tower, how does it happen that two towers are mentioned as the limit of the priests’ restoration of the wall?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Supposing the text to be correct, the tower of Hammeah may have been the Eastern tower of the same stronghold which is also called Hananel. From the emphatic way in which it is mentioned this fortress probably represented an important strategic point. Now ‘the castle (or bîrah) which appertaineth to the house’ may have stood on high ground near this point. And the conjecture is plausible that the tower of Hananel was the name given to an outwork of the great fortress at the point where the city wall ran into it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to this theory, Eliashib and the priests restored the city wall between the sheep gate and a portion of the great fortress which commanded the Temple. It does not appear from this chapter that these towers had been pulled down. They had possibly been left to receive a garrison or were not so easily dismantled as the walls.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then Eliashib the high priest rose up</span>. It is satisfactory to find Eliashib the high priest taking the part which befitted him on this occasion. Subsequently we find him "allied by marriage to Tobiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>), and guilty of a profanation of the temple (<span class="accented">ibid.</span> ver. 5). By the line of high priests given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10, 11</a>, it appears that Eliashib was the son of Joiakim, and the grandson of the Jeshua who returned from Babylon with Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-2.htm">Ezra 3:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With his brethren</span>.

The "sheep gate" appears to have been a gate in the eastern wall, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;</span> of St. John (John %;2), which was close to the pool of Bethesda. By this gate were brought in the sheep needed for sacrifice, which were then washed in the adjoining pool, and conveyed from it into the temple area, whereon the pool abuts. The priests dwelt principally in this portion of the city. <span class="cmt_word">They sanctified it</span>. This appears to have been a dedication quite distinct from that which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm">Nehemiah 12:27-43</a>. The priests, having completed the rebuilding of the sheep gate, and of the wall extending from it northwards as far as the tower of Hananeel, anticipated the general dedication by a special one, which "sanctified," or consecrated, their own portion of the wall Thus a sacred character was impressed on the work at the earliest possible moment, and it was placed under the protection of the Almighty. <span class="cmt_word">The tower of Meah</span> (or rather Hammeah, <span class="accented">i.e</span>. "the Hundred") and <span class="cmt_word">the tower of Hananeel</span> appear to have been situated almost at the same point of the wall. Perhaps they were opposite each other, like the towers in the walls of Babylon (Herod., 1:179). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then I((went on) ascending the valley and viewing the wall, and so entered by the valley-gate, and returned. &#1493;&#1488;&#1492;&#1497; with the participle expresses the continuance of an action, and hence in this place the continuous ascent of the valley and survey of the wall. The &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; which he ascended was doubtless the valley of Kidron (&#1511;&#1491;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-37.htm">1 Kings 2:37</a>, and elsewhere). &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; are connected, &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; expressing merely the idea of repetition (Gesenius, heb. Gram. 142, 3): I came again into the valley-gate. Older expositors incorrectly explain these words to mean, I turned round, traversing again the road by which I had come; Bertheau: I turned to go farther in a westerly direction, and after making the circuit of the entire city, I-re-entered by the valley-gate. This sense is correct as to fact, but inadmissible, as requiring too much to complete it. If we take &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; adverbially, these completions are unnecessary. Nehemiah does not give the particulars of the latter portion of his circuit, but merely tells us that after having ascended the valley of Kidron, he re-entered by the valley-gate, and returned to his residence, obviously assuming, that from the upper part of the vale of Kidron he could only return to the valley-gate at the west by passing along the northern part of the wall. </body></html>
