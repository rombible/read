It appears from hence, that the government of the Jews was an aristocracy, or a government in which the nobles were the rulers.

Others explain the plur. as indicating the numerous ‘lists’ prepared for signature, as if the different obligations would require different lists. This explanation cannot be pressed. It is sufficient to bear in mind that ‘the sealings’ were very probably ‘parchments’ or ‘tablets,’ and that several would be required for the signature of so large a number.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nehemiah, the Tirshatha</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-65.htm" title="And the Tirshatha said to them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.">Nehemiah 7:65</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-9.htm" title="And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said to all the people, This day is holy to the LORD your God; mourn not, nor weep.
