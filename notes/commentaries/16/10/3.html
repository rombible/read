The list of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-1.htm" title="Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,...">Nehemiah 12:1-3</a> agrees with it in 16 names. The number 21 is peculiar; in chap. 12 the number is larger by one. In Ezra 2, Nehemiah 7, only four priestly houses are recorded, viz. Jedaiah, Immer, Pashur and Harim, as having returned with Zerubbabel. Pashur is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-3.htm" title="Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,">Nehemiah 10:3</a>; Harim in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-5.htm" title="Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,">Nehemiah 10:5</a>. The other priestly families had either developed themselves out of these first four, or had arrived from time to time from Babylon.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That 21 and not 24 are recorded, is noteworthy. Various conjectures have been hazarded, e.g. that names have dropped out from the text, or that three of the priestly tribes refused to sign the document, or that the complete list of priestly houses has not yet been reorganised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Seraiah’s name is given first. To his family belonged both Eliashib the high-priest and Ezra the scribe. The absence of their names does not therefore deserve the importance which some commentators have given to it. A single signature for the whole house may have been affixed by Eliashib or by Ezra or by some other distinguished person of the same house. We have no reason to look for the names of individual priests among the names of the priestly houses.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm">Nehemiah 10:1</a>)<p>&#1492;&#1501; are the fathers who were not brought to repentance by God's goodness. &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, in their independent kingdom. &#1492;&#1512;&#1489; &#1496;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1498;, Thy much good, i.e., the fulness of Thy goodness, or "in the midst of Thy great blessing" (Bertheau). The predicate &#1492;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1492;, the wide, extensive country, is derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-36.htm">Nehemiah 9:36</a>., the prayer that God would not lightly regard the trouble of His people, is supported by a statement of the need and affliction in which they still are. They are bondmen in the land which God gave to their fathers as a free people, bondmen of the Persian monarchs; and the increase of the land which God appointed for His people belongs to the kings who rule over them. The rulers of the land dispose of their bodies and their cattle, by carrying off both men and cattle for their use, e.g., for military service. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-24.htm">Nehemiah 9:24</a>. </body></html>
