This figure is considerably in excess of the number of names under the same head in Ezra 2, Nehemiah 7.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) 14 names at least (i.e. Parosh, Pahath-moab, Elam, Zattu, Bani, Azgad, Bebai, Bigvai, Adin, Ater, Hariph (= Jorah Ezra 2), Hashum, Bezai, Anathoth) are found, as they occur here, in the lists of Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Adonijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-16.htm" title="Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,">Nehemiah 10:16</a>) is doubtless the same as Adonikam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-13.htm" title="The children of Adonikam, six hundred sixty and six.">Ezra 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-18.htm" title="The children of Adonikam, six hundred three score and seven.">Nehemiah 7:18</a>), Magpiash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-20.htm" title="Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,">Nehemiah 10:20</a>), as Magbish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-30.htm" title="The children of Magbish, an hundred fifty and six.">Ezra 2:30</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) The names of certain houses mentioned in the lists of Ezra 2 and Nehemiah 7. e.g. Shephatiah, Arah, Zaccai do not appear here; these houses had either died out, or left the city, or refused to sign.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) The addition of names may be explained by the gradual accession of families since the age of Zerubbabel. But the variety of documents employed by the compiler is quite sufficient to account for considerable discrepancy in the names, since the work of compilation must have taken place long after the lists were drawn up.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-16.htm">Nehemiah 10:16-29</a>)<p>The heads of the people. Forty-four names, thirteen of which are found in the list (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>) of the kindreds who returned with Zerubbabel; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>. The rest are names either of the heads of the different houses into which these kindreds were divided, or of the elders of the smaller towns of Benjamin and Judah. The fact that, while only thirty-three kindreds and placed are enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, forty-four occur here, - although names of kindreds mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, e.g., Shephatiah, Arah, Zaccai, etc., are wanting here, - is to be explained partly by the circumstance that these kindreds included several houses whose different heads all subscribed, and partly by fresh accessions during the course of years to the number of houses. </body></html>
