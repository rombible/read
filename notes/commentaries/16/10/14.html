Down to Magpiash the names correspond to those of lay families which returned with Zerubbabel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-3.htm">Ezra 2:3-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-8.htm">Nehemiah 7:8-33</a>), the first eighteen being personal, and the last three names of localities. <span class="cmt_word">Nebai</span> is the same as "Nebo" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-33.htm">Nehemiah 7:33</a>), and <span class="cmt_word">Magpiash</span> the same as Magbish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-30.htm">Ezra 2:30</a>). From <span class="cmt_word">Meshullam</span> to <span class="cmt_word">Baanah</span> (vers. 20-27) the names seem to be again personal; but they are new, and therefore probably those of individuals who were not authorised to represent either clans or localities. In ver. 17, the two names Ater and Hizkijah should be united by a hyphen, since it is clear that they represent the single family, Ater of Hezekiah, mentioned in Ezra it. 16 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-21.htm">Nehemiah 7:21</a>. "Hizkijah"and "Hezekiah" are in the original identical. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-3.htm">Nehemiah 10:3-10</a>)<p>At the head of the signatures stood Nehemiah the Tirshatha, as governor of the country, and Zidkijah, a high official, of whom nothing further is known, perhaps (after the analogy of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-9.htm">Ezra 4:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-17.htm">Ezra 4:17</a>) secretary to the governor. Then follow (in vv. 3-9) twenty-one names, with the addition: these, the priests. Of these twenty-one names, fifteen occur in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-2.htm">Nehemiah 12:2-7</a> as chiefs of the priests who came up with Joshua and Zerubbabel from Babylon, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-11.htm">Nehemiah 12:11-20</a> as heads of priestly houses. Hence it is obvious that all the twenty-one names are those of heads of priestly classes, who signed the agreement in the names of the houses and families of their respective classes. Seraiah is probably the prince of the house of God dwelling at Jerusalem, mentioned <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-11.htm">Nehemiah 11:11</a>, who signed in place of the high priest. For further remarks on the orders of priests and their heads, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1</a>. </body></html>
