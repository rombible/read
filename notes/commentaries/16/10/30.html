The fact that, while only thirty-three kindreds and placed are enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, forty-four occur here, - although names of kindreds mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, e.g., Shephatiah, Arah, Zaccai, etc., are wanting here, - is to be explained partly by the circumstance that these kindreds included several houses whose different heads all subscribed, and partly by fresh accessions during the course of years to the number of houses. </body></html>
