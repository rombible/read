For the purpose of giving a lasting influence to this day of prayer and fasting, the assembled people, after the confession of sin (given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9.htm">Nehemiah 9</a>), entered into a written agreement, by which they bound themselves by an oath to separate from the heathen, and to keep the commandments and ordinances of God, - a document being prepared for this purpose, and sealed by the heads of their different houses.<p>And because of all this we make and write a sure covenant; and our princes, Levites, and priests sign the sealed (document). &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; does not mean post omne hoc, after all that we have done this day (Schmid, Bertheau, and others); still less, in omni hoc malo, quod nobis obtigerat (Rashi, Aben Ezra), but upon all this, i.e., upon the foundation of the preceding act of prayer and penitence, we made &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, i.e., a settlement, a sure agreement (the word recurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-23.htm">Nehemiah 11:23</a>); hence &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; is used as with &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-8.htm">Nehemiah 9:8</a>. &#1488;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; may again be taken as the object of &#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;, we write it; &#1492;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1506;&#1500; be understood as "our princes sealed." &#1492;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is the sealed document; comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm">Jeremiah 22:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-14.htm">Jeremiah 22:14</a>. &#1492;&#1495;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500; means literally, Upon the sealed document were our princes, etc.; that is, our princes sealed or signed it.
