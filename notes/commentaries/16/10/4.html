They are bondmen in the land which God gave to their fathers as a free people, bondmen of the Persian monarchs; and the increase of the land which God appointed for His people belongs to the kings who rule over them. The rulers of the land dispose of their bodies and their cattle, by carrying off both men and cattle for their use, e.g., for military service. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-24.htm">Nehemiah 9:24</a>. </body></html>
