It is not another group, but stands at the head of the verse in apposition to the groups to be mentioned. ‘The priests’ are the individual members of the great houses whose representatives had taken part ‘in the sealing.’ So also the subordinate religious orders, who are here divided into their classes of (<span class="ital">a</span>) Levites proper, (<span class="ital">b</span>) porters, (<span class="ital">c</span>) singers, (<span class="ital">d</span>) Nethinim. With the last name we should also probably associate ‘the servants of Solomon,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-57.htm" title="The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the children of Sophereth, the children of Perida,">Nehemiah 7:57</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/2-43.htm" title="The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha, the children of Tabbaoth,...">Ezra 2:43-54</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Nethinims</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Nethinim.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all they that had separated themselves</span>] See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>. By this class are probably intended Jews who had not gone into exile, but, having either in foreign lands or in Palestine been faithless to their religion, had since separated themselves from idolatry. Another explanation, which has some support from the words ‘from the peoples of the lands,’ understands by this expression ‘proselytes who had attached themselves to the Jewish faith.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from the people</span> (R.V. <span class="bld">peoples</span>) <span class="ital">of the lands unto the law of God</span>] The antithesis is striking. Not ‘from the peoples of the lands to the people of Israel,’ but ‘from the peoples of the land,’ who were identified with abomination and filthiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>), to ‘the law of God,’ which was the one standard of the claim to be a true Israelite.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having knowledge</span>, and <span class="ital">having understanding</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">that had knowledge and understanding.</span> See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/8-2.htm" title="And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation both of men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, on the first day of the seventh month....">Nehemiah 8:2-3</a>; i.e. all of age and intelligence to know and understand the law.

The rest are names either of the heads of the different houses into which these kindreds were divided, or of the elders of the smaller towns of Benjamin and Judah. The fact that, while only thirty-three kindreds and placed are enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, forty-four occur here, - although names of kindreds mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, e.g., Shephatiah, Arah, Zaccai, etc., are wanting here, - is to be explained partly by the circumstance that these kindreds included several houses whose different heads all subscribed, and partly by fresh accessions during the course of years to the number of houses. </body></html>
