We must not only cease to do evil, but learn to do well. Let not any people expect the blessing of God, unless they keep up public worship. It is likely to go well with our houses, when care is taken that the work of God's house goes on well. When every one helps, and every one gives, though but little, toward a good work, the whole will come to be a large sum. We must do what we can in works of piety and charity; and whatever state we are placed in, cheerfully perform our duty to God, which will be the surest way to ease and liberty. As the ordinances of God are the appointed means of support to our souls, the believer will not grudge the expense; yet most people leave their souls to starve.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The third part of a sheckel - This appears to have been the first occasion on which an annual payment toward the maintenance of the temple service and fabric was established. The half-shekel of the Law <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-13.htm">Exodus 30:13</a> was paid only at the time of a census (which rarely took place), and was thus not a recurring tax.

The shewbread consisted of 12 unleavened cakes of fine meal, which were laid fresh every Sabbath in two rows of six upon the table in the Holy Place.

The name by which ‘the shewbread’ is here designated is ‘bread of arrangement,’ ‘lekhem hammaa-reketh’ (Vulg. ‘panes propositionis).

This is what is probably intended in the present passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-3.htm" title="And they set the altar on his bases; for fear was on them because of the people of those countries: and they offered burnt offerings thereon to the LORD, even burnt offerings morning and evening.">Ezra 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-5.htm" title="And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a freewill offering to the LORD.">Ezra 3:5</a>, and in the Books of Chronicles, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-3.htm" title="He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the law of the LORD.">2 Chronicles 31:3</a>. We need not expect to find so full a ritual in practice before, as there was after, the influence of Ezra’s work made itself felt: nor can we hope to find in the historical narrative full illustration of all the details of worship required by the ideal of the Priestly Law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Sacrifices were ‘continual’ (<span class="ital">tamidh</span>) in the sense of being regular and at stated times, as distinct from occasional, voluntary, and irregular offerings.

"Wave-offerings" and "peace-offerings" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10, 17, 19</a>) are probably intended.
