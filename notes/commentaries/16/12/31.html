It also contained the temple which was hallowed by the manifestation of His presence, and anew set apart to His service. It was on these accounts that Jerusalem was called "the holy city," and by this public and solemn act of religious observance, after a long period of neglect and desecration, it was, as it were, restored to its rightful proprietor. The dedication consisted in a solemn ceremonial, in which the leading authorities, accompanied by the Levitical singers, summoned from all parts of the country, and by a vast concourse of people, marched in imposing procession round the city walls, and, pausing at intervals to engage in united praises, prayer, and sacrifices, supplicated the continued presence, favor, and blessing on "the holy city." "The assembly convened near Jaffa Gate, where the procession commences. Then (Ne 12:31) I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall (near the Valley Gate), and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung gate (through Bethzo). And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah. And (Ne 12:37) at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they (descending by the Tower of Siloam on the interior, and then reascending) went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward (by the staircase of the rampart, having descended to dedicate the fountain structures). And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them (both parties having started from the junction of the first and second walls), and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall (beyond the corner gate). And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate (and the gate of Benjamin), and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the prison gate (or high gate, at the east end of the bridge). So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and half of the rulers with me (having thus performed the circuit of the investing walls), and arrived in the courts of the temple" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The princes of Judah, </span> and half of the people with them, as it is expressed afterwards, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-38.htm" title="And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them, and I after them, and the half of the people on the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even to the broad wall;">Nehemiah 12:38</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the wall; </span> for the wall was broad and strong, and so ordered that men might conveniently walk upon it, as at this day it is in many cities. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">On the right hand; </span> towards the south and east. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall,....

The words in the Hebrew, ‘from above, with respect to the wall’ have been considered by some to mean ‘beyond, at a little distance from the wall;’ by others ‘over against the wall.’ But a comparison with its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/13-4.htm" title="And Abijah stood up on mount Zemaraim, which is in mount Ephraim, and said, Hear me, you Jeroboam, and all Israel;">2 Chronicles 13:4</a> (= ‘upon’), <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-6.htm" title="And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him from his grief.

Nehemiah caused all the chiefs of the nation, both lay and clerical, to mount upon the wall, and there marshalled them into two companies, composed of clergy and laity intermixed, one of which he placed under the direction of Ezra (ver. 36), while of the other he took the command himself (ver. 38). The place of assemblage must have been some portion of the western wall, probably the central portion, near the modern Jaffa gate. From this Ezra's company proceeded southward, and then eastward, along the southern wall, while Nehemiah's marched northward, and then eastward, along the northern wall, both processions meeting midway in the eastern wall, between the "water" and the "prison" gates. <span class="cmt_word">Toward the dung gate</span>. On the position of this gate, see the comment on Nehemiah 2:13. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The names Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, frequently occur as those of heads of Levitical orders: the two first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-12.htm">Nehemiah 10:12</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-18.htm">Ezra 8:18</a>.; the two last in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-8.htm">Nehemiah 12:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-10.htm">Nehemiah 10:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-40.htm">Ezra 2:40</a>; and the comparison of these passages obliges us to regard and expunge as a gloss the &#1489;&#1468;&#1503; before Kadmiel.

The names of the brethren, i.e., of the Levitical singers, follow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>, where the first three names must be separated from those which follow, and combined with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm">Nehemiah 12:24</a>. This is obvious from the consideration, that Mattaniah and Bakbukiah are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a> as presidents of two companies of singers, and with them Abda the Jeduthunite, whence we are constrained to suppose that &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; is only another form for &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>. According, then, to what has been said, the division into verses must be changed, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a> should begin with the name &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub are chiefs of the doorkeepers; the two last names occur as such both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>, and even so early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>, whence we perceive that these were ancient names of races of Levitical doorkeepers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, answering to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; of the present verse, is also named with them. The combination &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is striking: we should at least have expected &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, because, while &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be combined with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may well be so; hence we must either transpose the words as above, or read according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. In the latter case, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is more closely defined by the apposition &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;: at the doors, viz., at the treasure-chambers of the doors.
