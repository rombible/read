Why the practice of inserting the names in the book of the chronicles ceased at this date it is impossible to say, unless it was that the chronicles themselves ceased to be compiled. There certainly appears to be a long gap in the authentic Jewish annals between the close of the Old Testament canon and the composition of the First Book of the Maccabees. <span class="cmt_word">Johanan, the son of Eliashib</span>.

That family, rather than personal, names are here intended is sufficiently shown in the final summary of ver. 26, since the same individuals cannot have flourished under Joiakim (B.C. 490-460)and also under Nehemiah (B.C. 444-430). The actual names - Jeshua, Kadmiel, Hashabiah, Shersbiah, etc. - are all found as family names. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a> contains the list of the priestly houses and their heads, which has been already explained in conjunction with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22-26</a>.

Whence it follows, that it does not apply only to the time of Joiakim; for though Ezra might indeed have come to Jerusalem in the latter days of Joiakim's high-priesthood, yet Nehemiah's arrival found his successor Eliashib already in office, and the statements of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm">Nehemiah 12:23</a> must be understood accordingly. </body></html>
