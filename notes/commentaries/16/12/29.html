Those that would be employed to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God. To those who are sanctified, all their creature-comforts and enjoyments are made holy.

It also contained the temple which was hallowed by the manifestation of His presence, and anew set apart to His service. It was on these accounts that Jerusalem was called "the holy city," and by this public and solemn act of religious observance, after a long period of neglect and desecration, it was, as it were, restored to its rightful proprietor. The dedication consisted in a solemn ceremonial, in which the leading authorities, accompanied by the Levitical singers, summoned from all parts of the country, and by a vast concourse of people, marched in imposing procession round the city walls, and, pausing at intervals to engage in united praises, prayer, and sacrifices, supplicated the continued presence, favor, and blessing on "the holy city." "The assembly convened near Jaffa Gate, where the procession commences. Then (Ne 12:31) I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall (near the Valley Gate), and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung gate (through Bethzo). And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah. And (Ne 12:37) at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they (descending by the Tower of Siloam on the interior, and then reascending) went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward (by the staircase of the rampart, having descended to dedicate the fountain structures). And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them (both parties having started from the junction of the first and second walls), and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall (beyond the corner gate). And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate (and the gate of Benjamin), and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the prison gate (or high gate, at the east end of the bridge). So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and half of the rulers with me (having thus performed the circuit of the investing walls), and arrived in the courts of the temple" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That they might be near at hand for the service of God, and of his house. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Also from the house of Gilgal,....

To judge from the &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; with which it commences, this verse seems to be the title of the list of Levites following, while the rest of its contents rather seems adapted for the subscription of the preceding list of priests (<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a>). &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1506;&#1500;, under the reign. The use of &#1506;&#1500; with reference to time is to be explained by the circumstance that the time, and here therefore the reign of Darius, is regarded as the ground and soil of that which is done in it, as e.g., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;, upon night  equals  at night-time. Darius is Darius Nothus, the second Persian monarch of that name; where also the meaning of this verse has been already discussed. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm">Nehemiah 12:23</a>, the original document in which the list of Levites was originally included, is alluded to as the book of the daily occurrences or events of the time, i.e., the public chronicle, a continuation of the former annals of the kingdom. &#1497;&#1502;&#1497; &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;, and also to the days of Johanan, the son of Eliashib. So far did the official records of the chronicle extend. That Nehemiah may have been still living in the days of Johanan, i.e., in the time of his high-priesthood, has been already shown, p. 95. The statements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm">Nehemiah 12:23</a> are aphoristic, and of the nature of supplementary and occasional remarks. </body></html>
