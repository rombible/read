Eight names are identical with those of the heads in David's time. On comparing the present list with that of the families who sealed to Nehemiah's covenant <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2-8</a>, we shall find that the first sixteen recur in that document nearly in the same order; but that the last six are absent from it. It would seem that as these six declined to seal to Nehemiah's covenant, they were placed below the rest here in a sort of supplementary list. Note especially the "and" which connects the second part of the lists with the earlier part, both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-19.htm">Nehemiah 12:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The introduction of the conjunction "and" here, and here only, in this list separates off very markedly the last six names from the first sixteen. A similar division is made in ver. 19. The reason for the division seems to be that these last six courses, though including some of the very highest priestly families, as those of Joiarib and Jedaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-36.htm">Ezra 2:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-39.htm">Nehemiah 7:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-10.htm">Nehemiah 11:10</a>), for some reason or other, did not seal to the covenant, whereas the other sixteen courses did so. <span class="cmt_word">Jedaiah</span>. The double occurrence of this name (in vers. 6 and 7) would naturally raise a suspicion of corruption; but the two Jedaiahs are confirmed by vers. 19, 21. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The enumeration concludes with the remark, "Of the Levites came divisions of Judah to Benjamin," which can only signify that divisions of Levites who, according to former arrangements, belonged to Judah, now came to Benjamin, i.e., dwelt among the Benjamites. </body></html>
