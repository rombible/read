The believer should undertake nothing which he does not dedicate to the Lord. We are concerned to cleanse our hands, and purify our hearts, when any work for God is to pass through them. Those that would be employed to sanctify others, must sanctify themselves, and set themselves apart for God. To those who are sanctified, all their creature-comforts and enjoyments are made holy. The people greatly rejoiced. All that share in public mercies, ought to join in public thanksgivings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The house of Gilgal - Or, "Beth-Gilgal" - probably the Gilgal north of Jerusalem (now "Jiljilia). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27-43. at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem&#8212;This ceremony of consecrating the wall and gates of the city was an act of piety on the part of Nehemiah, not merely to thank God in a general way for having been enabled to bring the building to a happy completion, but especially because that city was the place which He had chosen. It also contained the temple which was hallowed by the manifestation of His presence, and anew set apart to His service. It was on these accounts that Jerusalem was called "the holy city," and by this public and solemn act of religious observance, after a long period of neglect and desecration, it was, as it were, restored to its rightful proprietor. The dedication consisted in a solemn ceremonial, in which the leading authorities, accompanied by the Levitical singers, summoned from all parts of the country, and by a vast concourse of people, marched in imposing procession round the city walls, and, pausing at intervals to engage in united praises, prayer, and sacrifices, supplicated the continued presence, favor, and blessing on "the holy city." "The assembly convened near Jaffa Gate, where the procession commences. Then (Ne 12:31) I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall (near the Valley Gate), and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung gate (through Bethzo). And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah. And (Ne 12:37) at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they (descending by the Tower of Siloam on the interior, and then reascending) went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward (by the staircase of the rampart, having descended to dedicate the fountain structures). And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them (both parties having started from the junction of the first and second walls), and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall (beyond the corner gate). And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate (and the gate of Benjamin), and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the prison gate (or high gate, at the east end of the bridge). So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and half of the rulers with me (having thus performed the circuit of the investing walls), and arrived in the courts of the temple" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Partly by sprinkling the water of purification upon them, by which the tabernacle and sacred utensils were purified, <span class="bld">Numbers 8</span>; and partly by solemn prayers and sacrifices. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priests and the Levites purified themselves,....

Opposite to these four are placed their brethren, whose office it was "to praise (and) to give thanks according to the commandment of David," etc.: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-4.htm">1 Chronicles 16:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-30.htm">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/5-13.htm">2 Chronicles 5:13</a>; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; &#1491;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, ward opposite ward, elsewhere used of the gatekeepers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-16.htm">1 Chronicles 26:16</a>, is here applied to the position of the companies of singers in divine worship. The names of the brethren, i.e., of the Levitical singers, follow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a>, where the first three names must be separated from those which follow, and combined with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-24.htm">Nehemiah 12:24</a>. This is obvious from the consideration, that Mattaniah and Bakbukiah are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a> as presidents of two companies of singers, and with them Abda the Jeduthunite, whence we are constrained to suppose that &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1497;&#1492; is only another form for &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1468;&#1488; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>. According, then, to what has been said, the division into verses must be changed, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-25.htm">Nehemiah 12:25</a> should begin with the name &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501;. Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub are chiefs of the doorkeepers; the two last names occur as such both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a>, and even so early as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>, whence we perceive that these were ancient names of races of Levitical doorkeepers. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-42.htm">Ezra 2:42</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17</a>, &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, answering to &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; of the present verse, is also named with them. The combination &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is striking: we should at least have expected &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, because, while &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; cannot be combined with &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; may well be so; hence we must either transpose the words as above, or read according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-19.htm">Nehemiah 11:19</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;. In the latter case, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is more closely defined by the apposition &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;: at the doors, viz., at the treasure-chambers of the doors.
