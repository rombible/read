Whence it follows, that it does not apply only to the time of Joiakim; for though Ezra might indeed have come to Jerusalem in the latter days of Joiakim's high-priesthood, yet Nehemiah's arrival found his successor Eliashib already in office, and the statements of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-23.htm">Nehemiah 12:23</a> must be understood accordingly. </body></html>
