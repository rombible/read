Eight names are identical with those of the heads in David's time. On comparing the present list with that of the families who sealed to Nehemiah's covenant <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2-8</a>, we shall find that the first sixteen recur in that document nearly in the same order; but that the last six are absent from it. It would seem that as these six declined to seal to Nehemiah's covenant, they were placed below the rest here in a sort of supplementary list. Note especially the "and" which connects the second part of the lists with the earlier part, both in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-19.htm">Nehemiah 12:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Ne 12:1-9. Priests and Levites Who Came Up with Zerubbabel.<p>1. these are the priests&#8212;according to Ne 12:7, "the chief of the priests," the heads of the twenty-four courses into which the priesthood was divided (1Ch 24:1-20). Only four of the courses returned from the captivity (Ne 7:39-42; Ezr 2:36-39). But these were divided by Zerubbabel, or Jeshua, into the original number of twenty-four. Twenty-two only are enumerated here, and no more than twenty in Ne 12:12-21. The discrepancy is due to the extremely probable circumstance that two of the twenty-four courses had become extinct in Babylon; for none belonging to them are reported as having returned (Ne 12:2-5). Hattush and Maadiah may be omitted in the account of those persons' families (Ne 12:12), for these had no sons.<p>Shealtiel&#8212;or Salathiel.<p>Ezra&#8212;This was most likely a different person from the pious and patriotic leader. If he were the same person, he would now have reached a very patriarchal age&#8212;and this longevity would doubtless be due to his eminent piety and temperance, which are greatly conducive to the prolongation of life, but, above all, to the special blessing of God, who had preserved and strengthened him for the accomplishment of the important work he was called upon to undertake in that critical period of the Church's history.The priests, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/12-1.htm" title="Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,...">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a></span>, and Levites which came up with Zerubbabel, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-8.htm" title="Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and his brothers.">Nehemiah 12:8</a>,9</span>.

Immer may possibly be concealed in the name of (4) Amariah. Pashhur has dropped out entirely.
