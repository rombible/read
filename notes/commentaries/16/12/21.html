This was the son and successor of Jeshua, or Joshua, the first high priest of the second temple; the principal men of the priesthood in his time were as follow, and who were the sons, or however the descendants of the priests in the time of his father before mentioned: these were Meraiah, Hananiah, Meshullam, Jehohanan, Jonathan, Joseph, Adna, Helkai, Zechariah, (the prophet of that name,) Meshullam, Zichri, Piltai, Shammua, Jehonathan, Mattenai, Uzzi, Kallai, Eber, Hashabiah, Nethaneel; in all twenty, whereas there are twenty two named, as in his father's days, there being no sons or descendants from two of them, namely, Hattush and Miamin. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-12.htm">Nehemiah 12:12-21</a> contains the list of the priestly houses and their heads, which has been already explained in conjunction with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-1.htm">Nehemiah 12:1-7</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22-26</a>.
