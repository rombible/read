It also contained the temple which was hallowed by the manifestation of His presence, and anew set apart to His service. It was on these accounts that Jerusalem was called "the holy city," and by this public and solemn act of religious observance, after a long period of neglect and desecration, it was, as it were, restored to its rightful proprietor. The dedication consisted in a solemn ceremonial, in which the leading authorities, accompanied by the Levitical singers, summoned from all parts of the country, and by a vast concourse of people, marched in imposing procession round the city walls, and, pausing at intervals to engage in united praises, prayer, and sacrifices, supplicated the continued presence, favor, and blessing on "the holy city." "The assembly convened near Jaffa Gate, where the procession commences. Then (Ne 12:31) I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall (near the Valley Gate), and appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks, whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall towards the dung gate (through Bethzo). And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah. And (Ne 12:37) at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they (descending by the Tower of Siloam on the interior, and then reascending) went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward (by the staircase of the rampart, having descended to dedicate the fountain structures). And the other company of them that gave thanks went over against them (both parties having started from the junction of the first and second walls), and I after them, and the half of the people upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto the broad wall (beyond the corner gate). And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate (and the gate of Benjamin), and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate; and they stood still in the prison gate (or high gate, at the east end of the bridge). So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and half of the rulers with me (having thus performed the circuit of the investing walls), and arrived in the courts of the temple" [Barclay, City of the Great King].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At the dedication of the wall; </span> and of the gates, which are mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-30.htm" title="And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.">Nehemiah 12:30</a></span>; and of the city itself within the gates; which is here dedicated to God, and to his honour and service, not only upon a general account, by which we ought to devote ourselves, and all that is ours, to God; but upon a more special ground, because this was a place which God himself had chosen, and sanctified by his temple and gracious presence, and therefore did of right belong to him; whence it is oft called <span class="ital">the holy city</span>, as hath been observed before.

In which many priests and Levites assisted, and seems to be the reason of the above account of them; the dedication of the wall takes in the whole city, gates, and houses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-30.htm">Nehemiah 12:30</a>, and if a new house was to be dedicated, much more a new city, and especially the holy city, in which stood the temple of the Lord, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5</a>, this dedication was made by prayer and songs of praise, as follow, and no doubt by sacrifices, and was kept as a festival; and indeed, according to the Jewish writers (q), it was annually observed on the seventh of Elul, or August; it was on the twenty fifth of that month that the wall was finished, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm">Nehemiah 6:15</a>, but the gates were not set up, and all things for the dedication were not ready till Elul, or August, following; and then all being finished, they made and served the seventh of that month as a festival: <p>they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness; to assist in the solemnity of the day both with vocal and instrumental music, as follows: <p>both with thanksgiving and with singing; with songs of praise and thankfulness vocally, that they had been able, notwithstanding all the malice of their enemies, to build the wall in so short a time; or with a song, perhaps the thirtieth psalm was sung on this occasion: <p>with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps; some playing on one, and some on another, which were the three principal instruments of music used by them, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>. <p>(q) Megillath Thainith, c. 3. apud Selden. de Synedr. l. 3. c. 13. sect. 12. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nehemiah/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">at the dedication of the wall</span>] It is only natural to suppose that the dedication of the walls took place at no long interval after their completion. The walls were finished on the 25th of the month Elul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-15.htm" title="So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty and two days.">Nehemiah 6:15</a>) or September. According to <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/1-18.htm" title="Therefore whereas we are now purposed to keep the purification of the temple upon the five and twentieth day of the month Casleu, we thought it necessary to certify you thereof, that ye also might keep it, as the feast of the tabernacles, and of the fire, which was given us when Neemias offered sacrifice, after that he had builded the temple and the altar.">2Ma 1:18</a> Nehemiah on the 25th of Chislev (December) celebrated the restoration of the altar. If this date may be relied upon as representing a true tradition of the solemn dedication described in these verses, exactly three months elapsed between the completion and the dedication of the walls. It has been by some considered improbable that the Feast of Tabernacles and the Sealing of the Covenant (8–10) would have taken place before the Dedication described in these verses; and accordingly the events narrated in those chapters have been ascribed to the following year.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Rawlinson is of opinion that ‘the <span class="ital">nexus</span> of the remainder of this chapter with the next and the date given in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm" title="But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I to the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:">Nehemiah 13:6</a>, make it certain that the ceremony was deferred for the space of nearly twelve years.
