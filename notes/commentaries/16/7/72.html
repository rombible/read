Every good gift and every good work are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is of him, and therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence, must be ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe to those who turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happy those who dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service and glory!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-69.htm">Ezra 2:69</a> there is considerable difference between the totals for gold, silver, and garments.

The resolution to gather together the nobles and rulers of the people for the purpose of making a list of their kinsmen, and thus to obtain a basis for the operations contemplated for increasing the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are combined, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>.
