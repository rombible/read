Every good gift and every good work are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is of him, and therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence, must be ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe to those who turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happy those who dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service and glory!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is argued by some that the entire catalogue which follows <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7-73</a> is not the register of them "which came up 'at the first'," but of the Jewish people in Nehemiah's time. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a> are, however, very positive in their support of the usual view; and some of the arguments against it are thought to be met by considering the Nehemiah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a> a person different from Nehemiah the governor; and "Tirshatha" an official title likely to have belonged to others besides Nehemiah (see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a> note.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 7:5-38. Genealogy of Those Who Came at the First Out of Babylon.<p>5. my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles, &c.&#8212;The arrangement about to be described, though dictated by mere common prudence, is, in accordance with the pious feelings of Nehemiah, ascribed not to his own prudence or reflection, but to the grace of God prompting and directing him. He resolved to prepare a register of the returned exiles, containing an exact record of the family and ancestral abode of every individual. While thus directing his attention, he discovered a register of the first detachment who had come under the care of Zerubbabel. It is transcribed in the following verses, and differs in some few particulars from that given in Ezr 2:1-61. But the discrepancy is sufficiently accounted for from the different circumstances in which the two registers were taken; that of Ezra having been made up at Babylon, while that of Nehemiah was drawn out in Judea, after the walls of Jerusalem had been rebuilt. The lapse of so many years might well be expected to make a difference appear in the catalogue, through death or other causes; in particular, one person being, according to Jewish custom, called by different names. Thus Hariph (Ne 7:24) is the same as Jorah (Ezr 2:18), Sia (Ne 7:47) the same as Siaha (Ezr 2:44), &c. Besides other purposes to which this genealogy of the nobles, rulers, and people was subservient, one leading object contemplated by it was to ascertain with accuracy the parties to whom the duty legally belonged of ministering at the altar and conducting the various services of the temple. For guiding to exact information in this important point of enquiry, the possession of the old register of Zerubbabel was invaluable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These are the children of the province that went up out of the captivity,.... Who were of the province of Judea, as it was now reduced, and came up out of the captivity of Babylon through the edict of Cyrus; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>, where the same preface is given to the list of names as here; and from hence to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-69.htm">Nehemiah 7:69</a> the same account is given of persons and families as there, with some little difference of numbers and names; in some instances there are more in this list, in others fewer, which may be thus accounted for; that list was made in Babylon, when, upon the edict of Cyrus, the Jews, who intended to go up with Zerubbabel, gave in their names, and they were registered; but this was made when they came to Jerusalem; now some of those that gave in their names changed their minds, and tarried in Babylon, and some might die by the way, which makes the numbers fewer in some instances; and others who did not give in their names at first, but, being better disposed towards their own country, followed after and joined those which were returning, and increased the number of others; to which may be added what Abendana observes, that in Ezra an account is given of those that came out of the captivity by the companies, in which they came not genealogized, and had a mixture of persons of other families in them, and some that had no genealogy; but afterwards, when they were genealogized according to their families, a register of their genealogies was made, and is what Nehemiah now found, and here gives; and, as for difference of names, that may be owing to the carelessness of copiers, or to the different pronunciation of names, or some men might have two names; the matter is of no great moment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and two.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The watching of the city provided for. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a> When the wall was built, Nehemiah set up the doors in the gates, to complete the fortification of Jerusalem (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-1.htm">Nehemiah 6:1</a>). Then were the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites entrusted with the care (&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1511;&#1491;, praefici; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-14.htm">Nehemiah 12:14</a>). The care of watching the walls and gates is meant in this connection. According to ancient appointment, it was the duty of the doorkeepers to keep watch over the house of God, and to open and close the gates of the temple courts; comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-17.htm">1 Chronicles 9:17-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-12.htm">1 Chronicles 26:12-19</a>. The singers and the Levites appointed to assist the priests, on the contrary, had, in ordinary times, nothing to do with the service of watching. Under the present extraordinary circumstances, however, Nehemiah committed also to these two organized corporations the task of keeping watch over the walls and gates of the city, and placed them under the command of his brother Hanani, and of Hananiah the ruler of the citadel. This is expressed by the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-2.htm">Nehemiah 7:2</a> : I gave Hanani ... and Hananiah ... charge over Jerusalem. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492; is the fortress or citadel of the city lying to the north of the temple (see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-8.htm">Nehemiah 2:8</a>), in which was probably located the royal garrison, the commander of which was in the service of the Persian king. The choice of this man for so important a charge is explained by the additional clause: "for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many." The &#1499;&#1468; before &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is the so-called Caph veritatis, which expresses a comparison with the idea of the matter: like a man whom one may truly call faithful. &#1502;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is comparative: more God-fearing than many.</body></html>
