Every good gift and every good work are from above. God gives knowledge, he gives grace; all is of him, and therefore all must be to him. What is done by human prudence, must be ascribed to the direction of Divine Providence. But woe to those who turn back from the Lord, loving this present world! and happy those who dedicate themselves, and their substance, to his service and glory!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is argued by some that the entire catalogue which follows <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7-73</a> is not the register of them "which came up 'at the first'," but of the Jewish people in Nehemiah's time. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a> are, however, very positive in their support of the usual view; and some of the arguments against it are thought to be met by considering the Nehemiah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm">Nehemiah 7:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a> a person different from Nehemiah the governor; and "Tirshatha" an official title likely to have belonged to others besides Nehemiah (see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-63.htm">Ezra 2:63</a> note.) <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 7:39-73.

Who were of the province of Judea, as it was now reduced, and came up out of the captivity of Babylon through the edict of Cyrus; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>, where the same preface is given to the list of names as here; and from hence to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-69.htm">Nehemiah 7:69</a> the same account is given of persons and families as there, with some little difference of numbers and names; in some instances there are more in this list, in others fewer, which may be thus accounted for; that list was made in Babylon, when, upon the edict of Cyrus, the Jews, who intended to go up with Zerubbabel, gave in their names, and they were registered; but this was made when they came to Jerusalem; now some of those that gave in their names changed their minds, and tarried in Babylon, and some might die by the way, which makes the numbers fewer in some instances; and others who did not give in their names at first, but, being better disposed towards their own country, followed after and joined those which were returning, and increased the number of others; to which may be added what Abendana observes, that in Ezra an account is given of those that came out of the captivity by the companies, in which they came not genealogized, and had a mixture of persons of other families in them, and some that had no genealogy; but afterwards, when they were genealogized according to their families, a register of their genealogies was made, and is what Nehemiah now found, and here gives; and, as for difference of names, that may be owing to the carelessness of copiers, or to the different pronunciation of names, or some men might have two names; the matter is of no great moment. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Amon.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nehemiah/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">59</span>. <span class="ital">Pochereth Zebaim</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">Pochereth-hazzebaim.</span> ‘Of Zebaim’ appears in some copies of the A.V.; but ‘of’ is not in the 1611 edition.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And God put into my heart, i.e., God inspired me with the resolution; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>.

The resolution to gather together the nobles and rulers of the people for the purpose of making a list of their kinsmen, and thus to obtain a basis for the operations contemplated for increasing the inhabitants of Jerusalem. &#1493;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; are combined, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm">Nehemiah 2:16</a>.

This list, vv. 6-73a, is identical with that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/2.htm">Ezra 2</a>, and has been already discussed in our remarks on that chapter. </body></html>
