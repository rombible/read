This, no doubt, he had furnished for his use, and here Tobiah lodged, in order that he and the high-priest might have more free and secret communication with each other, this being a place where the people might not come.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-9 Israel was a peculiar people, and not to mingle with the nations. See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The offerings of the priests - i e "the portion of the offerings assigned for their sustenance to the priests." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4, 5. before this&#8212;The practice of these mixed marriages, in open neglect or violation of the law, had become so common, that even the pontifical house, which ought to have set a better example, was polluted by such an impure mixture.<p>Eliashib the priest &#8230; was allied unto Tobiah&#8212;This person was the high priest (Ne 13:28; also Ne 3:1), who, by virtue of his dignified office, had the superintendence and control of the apartments attached to the temple. The laxity of his principles, as well as of his practice, is sufficiently apparent from his contracting a family connection with so notorious an enemy of Israel as Tobiah. But his obsequious attentions had carried him much farther; for to accommodate so important a person as Tobiah on his occasional visits to Jerusalem, Eliashib had provided him a splendid apartment in the temple. The introduction of so gross an impropriety can be accounted for in no other way than by supposing that in the absence of the priests and the cessation of the services, the temple was regarded as a common public building, which might, in the circumstances, be appropriated as a palatial residence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He had prepared for him a great chamber; </span> by removing the things which were in it, and uniting divers small chambers into one, and furnishing it for thee use of Tobiah when he came to Jerusalem; whom he seems to have lodged there that he might have more free and secret communication with him, this being in a place where the people might not come. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he had prepared for him a great chamber,....

"And (so also) the singers and doorkeepers," i.e., they, too, observed the duties incumbent on them. This must be mentally supplied from the beginning of the verse.

As &#1493; is here omitted, so does it also appear superfluously before &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-46.htm">Nehemiah 12:46</a>, probably by a clerical error. The verse can be only understood as saying: "for in the days of David, Asaph was of old chief of the singers, and of the songs of praise, and of the thanksgiving unto God." &#1493; before Asaph is here out of place; for to take it as introducing a conclusion: in the days of David, therefore, was Asaph ... seems unnatural. The &#1493; probably came into the text through a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35-15.htm">2 Chronicles 35:15</a>. The matter, however, of these passages is consistent with the naming of David and Asaph, while such a co-ordination is unsuitable in the present passage. The Masoretes have indeed attempted to make sense of the words by altering the singular &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; into the plural &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;; but the Keri &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is nothing more than a worthless conjecture, arising partly from the unsuitableness of &#1493; before &#1488;&#1505;&#1507;, and partly from the consideration that Henan and Ethan were, as well as Asaph, chiefs of bands of singers. Nehemiah, however, was not concerned in this passage about exactness of statement, - the mention of Asaph as chief of the singers being quite sufficient for the purpose of his remark, that from the times of David onward orders of singers had existed. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a> this subject is concluded by the general statement that all Israel, i.e., the whole community, in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, gave the portions prescribed in the law for the ministers of the sanctuary, singers, doorkeepers, Levites, and priests. &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, they were sanctifying, i.e., consecrabant. &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to sanctify, said of the bringing of gifts and dues to the ministers of the sanctuary; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-27.htm">1 Chronicles 26:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-14.htm">Leviticus 27:14</a>.
