We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it.

But his obsequious attentions had carried him much farther; for to accommodate so important a person as Tobiah on his occasional visits to Jerusalem, Eliashib had provided him a splendid apartment in the temple.

On the other hand the incident which here connects ‘Eliashib the priest’ with Tobiah is of so similar a character to that which associates ‘Eliashib the high-priest’ in alliance with Sanballat (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm" title="And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.">Nehemiah 13:28</a></span>), that it is most natural to suppose the same person is denoted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The full title is not, as some fancifully suggest, withheld out of respect for the office which was so degraded. It is more probable that Nehemiah is recording the fact that ‘the priest who was appointed over the chambers of the house of God’ happened in this instance to be the high-priest himself: perhaps having been appointed to this duty before his succession to the high-priestly office, he still retained the charge. Again, it may be remembered that in old times ‘the priest’ was the customary title of the high-priest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If the same as the high-priest, it has been remarked that his name does not appear in chap. 10 among those that signed the covenant. It is however somewhat hazardous to conclude, as commentators have generally done, that he must therefore have refused his signature and have openly opposed the policy of Nehemiah. The names in chap. 10 are most of them the names of houses, and the high-priest’s name is probably represented in the mention of ‘Seraiah.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having the oversight of</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">who was appointed over.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the chamber</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">the chambers.</span> Marg. ‘Heb. <span class="ital">the chamber</span>’. The singular does not give the right meaning. Eliashib in order to dispose of ‘a great chamber’ to Tobiah, must have had all the Temple chambers under his charge. The proposal to read the plural ‘chambers’ (<span class="ital">lishkôth</span>) instead of the singular ‘chamber’ (<span class="ital">lishkath</span>) is probably right. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-9.htm" title="Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat offering and the frankincense.">Nehemiah 13:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The versions give quite an erroneous turn to the passage; LXX. <span class="greekheb">οἰκῶν ἐν γαζοφυλακίῳ</span>, Vulg. ‘præpositus in gazophylacio.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>was <span class="ital">allied</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">being allied.</span> A relationship by marriage is intended by this expression, which is the same as that rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm" title="And Naomi said to her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the LORD, who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead.

It is questioned whether the high priest of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> is meant, and noted that the expression used - "the priest"- does not always designate "the high priest" (see ver. 13); but the important charge said to have been assigned to him, the alliance with so great a man as Tobiah, and the important step taken, the assignment to a heathen of a residence within the temple precincts, imply a man of high authority, and suit better with the high priest than with any one of lower rank. Moreover, the fact that Eliashib's leanings were towards the enemies of Nehemiah accounts for his disappearance from the history from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Having the oversight</span>.

The verse can be only understood as saying: "for in the days of David, Asaph was of old chief of the singers, and of the songs of praise, and of the thanksgiving unto God." &#1493; before Asaph is here out of place; for to take it as introducing a conclusion: in the days of David, therefore, was Asaph ... seems unnatural.

The matter, however, of these passages is consistent with the naming of David and Asaph, while such a co-ordination is unsuitable in the present passage.

Nehemiah, however, was not concerned in this passage about exactness of statement, - the mention of Asaph as chief of the singers being quite sufficient for the purpose of his remark, that from the times of David onward orders of singers had existed. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-47.htm">Nehemiah 12:47</a> this subject is concluded by the general statement that all Israel, i.e., the whole community, in the days of Zerubbabel and Nehemiah, gave the portions prescribed in the law for the ministers of the sanctuary, singers, doorkeepers, Levites, and priests. &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, they were sanctifying, i.e., consecrabant. &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, to sanctify, said of the bringing of gifts and dues to the ministers of the sanctuary; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-27.htm">1 Chronicles 26:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-14.htm">Leviticus 27:14</a>.
