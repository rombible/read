His conscientious fidelity had brought him into collision not only with external enemies but with many of his own brethren. His rigorous reformation has been assailed by many moralists and commentators in every age. But in these words he commits all to God, as it were by anticipation.—It may be added that with these words end the annals of Old Testament history.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/nehemiah/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm" title="And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the first fruits.

In the education of children, great care should be taken about the government of their tongues; that they learn not the language of Ashdod, no impious or impure talk, no corrupt communication. Nehemiah showed the evil of these marriages. Some, more obstinate than the rest, he smote, that is, ordered them to be beaten by the officers according to the law, De 25:2,3. Here are Nehemiah's prayers on this occasion He prays, Remember them, O my God. Lord, convince and convert them; put them in mind of what they should be and do. The best services to the public have been forgotten by those for whom they were done, therefore Nehemiah refers himself to God, to recompense him. This may well be the summary of our petitions; we need no more to make us happy than this; Remember me, O my God, for good. We may humbly hope that the Lord will remember us and our services, although, after lives of unwearied activity and usefulness, we shall still see cause to abhor ourselves and repent in dust and ashes, and to cry out with Nehemiah, Spare me, O my God, according to the greatness of they mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wards - Rather, "the offices or observances."

Prof. Kirkpatrick suggests that Nehemiah’s first Mission lasted ‘perhaps for not more than a year,’ and that he then returned to Susa. The words ‘I went to the king’ he explains of Nehemiah’s going to serve his turn as cupbearer; and ‘at the end of certain days’ he would refer to the close of his term of office.

On the recurrence of such marriages after the separations effected by Ezra of those existing at his arrival at Jerusalem. Nehemiah did not insist on the immediate dissolution of these marriages, but caused the men to swear that they would desist from such connections, setting before them, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-26.htm">Nehemiah 13:26</a>, how grievous a sin they were committing. "Did not Solomon, king of Israel, sin on account of these?" (&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;, on account of strange wives). And among many nations there was no king like him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-12.htm">1 Kings 3:12</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-12.htm">2 Chronicles 1:12</a>); and he was beloved of his God (alluding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>), and God made him king over all Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-1.htm">1 Kings 4:1</a>); and even him did foreign women cause to sin (comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-1.htm">1 Kings 11:1-3</a>). "And of you is it heard to do (that ye do) all this great evil, to transgress against our God, and to marry strange wives?" Bertheau thus rightly understands the sentence: "If the powerful King Solomon was powerless to resist the influence of foreign wives, and if he, the beloved God, found in his relation to God no defence against the sin to which they seduced him, is it not unheard of for you to commit so great an evil?" He also rightly explains &#1492;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506; according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>; while Gesenius in his Thes. still takes it, like Rambach, as the first person imperf.: nobisne morem geramus faciendo; or: Should we obey you to do so great an evil? (de Wette); which meaning - apart from the consideration that no obedience, but only toleration of the illegal act, is here in question - greatly weakens, if it does not quite destroy, the contrast between Solomon and &#1500;&#1499;&#1501;. </body></html>
