The Levites had been wronged; their portions had not been given them. They were gone to get livelihoods for themselves and their families, for their profession would not maintain them. A maintenance not sufficient, makes a poor ministry. The work is neglected, because the workmen are. Nehemiah laid the fault upon the rulers. Both ministers and people, who forsake religion and the services of it, and magistrates, who do not what they can to keep them to it, will have much to answer for. He delayed not to bring the Levites to their places again, and that just payment should be made. Nehemiah on every occasion looked up to God, and committed himself and all his affairs to Him. It pleased him to think that he had been of use to revive and support religion in his country. He here refers to God, not in pride, but with a humble appeal concerning his honest intention in what he had done. He prays, Remember me; not, Reward me. Wipe not out my good deeds; not, Publish them, or record them. Yet he was rewarded, and his good deeds recorded. God does more than we are able to ask.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>etc. During Nehemiah's absence there had been a general falling away, and there was danger of a complete national apostasy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 13:10-14.

And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them&#8212;The people, disgusted with the malversations of Eliashib, or the lax and irregular performance of the sacred rites, withheld the tithes, so that the ministers of religion were compelled for their livelihood to withdraw to their patrimonial possessions in the country. The temple services had ceased; all religious duties had fallen into neglect. The money put into the sacred treasury had been squandered in the entertainment of an Ammonite heathen, an open and contemptuous enemy of God and His people. The return of the governor put an end to these disgraceful and profane proceedings. He administered a sharp rebuke to those priests to whom the management of the temple and its services was committed, for the total neglect of their duties, and the violation of the solemn promises which they had made to him at his departure. He upbraided them with the serious charge of having not only withheld from men their dues, but of having robbed God, by neglecting the care of His house and service. And thus having roused them to a sense of duty and incited them to testify their godly sorrow for their criminal negligence by renewed devotedness to their sacred work, Nehemiah restored the temple services. He recalled the dispersed Levites to the regular discharge of their duties; while the people at large, perceiving that their contributions would be no longer perverted to improper uses, willingly brought in their tithes as formerly. Men of integrity and good report were appointed to act as trustees of the sacred treasures, and thus order, regularity, and active service were re-established in the temple.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The portions of the Levites had not been given them; </span> which might be either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

While Nehemiah was at Babylon with King Artaxerxes, Eliashib the high priest had given up to his relative, Tobiah the Ammonite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm">Nehemiah 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm">Nehemiah 4:3</a>, and elsewhere), a large chamber in the temple, i.e., in the fore-court of the temple (v. 7), probably for his use as a dwelling when he visited Jerusalem (see rem. on v. 8). On his return, Nehemiah immediately cast all the furniture of Tobiah out of this chamber, purified the chambers, and restored them to their proper use as a magazine for the temple stores. &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, before this (comp. Ewald, 315, c), refers to the beforementioned separation of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; from Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>). Eliashib the priest is probably the high priest of that name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-1.htm">Nehemiah 3:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-10.htm">Nehemiah 12:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-22.htm">Nehemiah 12:22</a>). This may be inferred from the particular: set over (he being set over) the chambers of the house of our God; for such oversight of the chambers of the temple would certainly be entrusted to no simple priest, though this addition shows that this oversight did not absolutely form part of the high priest's office. For &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, in the sense of to set, to place over, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm">1 Kings 2:35</a>; the construction with &#1489;&#1468; instead of &#1506;&#1500; is, however, unusual, but may be derived from the local signification of &#1489;&#1468;, upon, over. Ewald and Bertheau are for reading &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1514; instead of the sing. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a> it is not &#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; that is spoken of, but a large chamber. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514; may, however, be also understood collectively. Eliashib, being a relation of Tobiah (&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1489; like <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/2-20.htm">Ruth 2:20</a>), prepared him a chamber. The predicate of the sentence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>, follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a> with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;, in the form of a conclusion following the accessory sentence of the subject. How Tobiah was related to Eliashib is nowhere stated. Bertheau conjectures that it was perhaps only through the circumstance that Johanan, the son of Tobiah, had married a daughter of Meshullam ben Berechiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-18.htm">Nehemiah 6:18</a>), who, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-30.htm">Nehemiah 3:30</a>, was a priest or Levite, and might have been nearly related to the high priest. "A great chamber," perhaps made so by throwing several chambers into one, as older expositors have inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-9.htm">Nehemiah 13:9</a>, according to which Nehemiah, after casting out the goods of Tobiah, had the chambers (plural) cleansed. The statement also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a>, that there (in this great chamber) were aforetime laid up not only the meat-offerings (i.e., oil and flour, the materials for them), the incense, and the sacred vessels, but also the tithe of the corn, the new wine, and the oil, and the heave-offerings of the priests, seems to confirm this view. This tenth is designated as &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514;, the command of the Levites, i.e., what was apportioned to the Levites according to the law, the legal dues for which &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; is elsewhere usual; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-3.htm">Deuteronomy 18:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-13.htm">1 Samuel 2:13</a>. The heave-offering of the priest is the tenth of their tenth which the Levites had to contribute, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a>. </body></html>
