See the benefit of publicly reading the word of God; when it is duly attended to, it discovers to us sin and duty, good and evil, and shows wherein we have erred. We profit, when we are thus wrought upon to separate from evil. Those that would drive sin out of their hearts, the living temples, must throw out its household stuff, and all the provision made for it; and take away all the things that are the food and fuel of lust; this is really to mortify it. When sin is cast out of the heart by repentance, let the blood of Christ be applied to it by faith, then let it be furnished with the graces of God's Spirit, for every good work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The chambers - The "great chamber" assigned to Tobiah <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-5.htm">Nehemiah 13:5</a> contained, it would seem, more than one apartment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-9. But in all this was not I at Jerusalem&#8212;Eliashib (concluding that, as Nehemiah had departed from Jerusalem, and, on the expiry of his allotted term of absence, had resigned his government, he had gone not to return) began to use great liberties, and, there being none left whose authority or frown he dreaded, allowed himself to do things most unworthy of his sacred office, and which, though in unison with his own irreligious character, he would not have dared to attempt during the residence of the pious governor. Nehemiah resided twelve years as governor of Jerusalem, and having succeeded in repairing and refortifying the city, he at the end of that period returned to his duties in Shushan. How long [Nehemiah] remained there is not expressly said, but "after certain days," which is a Scripture phraseology for a year or a number of years, he obtained leave to resume the government of Jerusalem; to his deep mortification and regret, he found matters in the neglected and disorderly state here described. Such gross irregularities as were practised, such extraordinary corruptions as had crept in, evidently imply the lapse of a considerable time. Besides, they exhibit the character of Eliashib, the high priest, in a most unfavorable light; for while he ought, by his office, to have preserved the inviolable sanctity of the temple and its furniture, his influence had been directly exercised for evil; especially he had given permission and countenance to a most indecent outrage&#8212;the appropriation of the best apartments in the sacred building to a heathen governor, one of the worst and most determined enemies of the people and the worship of God. The very first reform Nehemiah on his second visit resolved upon, was the stopping of this gross profanation [by Eliashib]. The chamber which had been polluted by the residence of the idolatrous Ammonite was, after undergoing the process of ritual purification (Nu 15:9), restored to its proper use&#8212;a storehouse for the sacred vessels.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They cleansed the chambers, </span> by such means and rites as were then usual in such cases.

Regarding the sacred place as polluted by its conversion to secular uses, Nehemiah had it purified, and so reconsecrated.

The word is here transferred to strangers of different heathen nationalities living among the Israelites. The date of the occurrence here related cannot be more precisely defined from the &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;. Public readings of the law frequently took place in those days, as is obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8.htm">Nehemiah 8</a> and 9, where we learn that in the seventh month the book of the law was publicly read, not only on the first and second days, but also daily during the feast of tabernacles, and again on the day of prayer and fasting on the twenty-fourth of the month. It appears, however, from &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm">Nehemiah 13:6</a>, that the reading <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm">Nehemiah 13:1-3</a> took place in the interval between Nehemiah's first and second stay at Jerusalem. This view is not opposed by the facts mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>. and 23f. The separation of the &#1506;&#1512;&#1489; could not be carried out at once; and hence, notwithstanding repeated resolutions to sever themselves from strangers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-2.htm">Nehemiah 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-31.htm">Nehemiah 10:31</a>), cases to the contrary might be discovered, and make fresh separations needful. </body></html>
