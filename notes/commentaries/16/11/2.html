Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To bring one of ten - Artificial enlargements of capitals by forcible transfers of population to them, were not unusual in ancient times. About 500 B.C., Syracuse became a great city in this way. Tradition ascribed the greatness of Rome, in part, to this cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 11<p>Ne 11:1, 2. The Rulers, Voluntary Men, and Every Tenth Man Chosen by Lot, Dwell at Jerusalem.<p>1. the rulers &#8230; dwelt at Jerusalem&#8212;That city being the metropolis of the country, it was right and proper that the seat of government should be there. But the exigency of the times required that special measures should be taken to insure the residence of an adequate population for the custody of the buildings and the defense of the city. From the annoyances of restless and malignant enemies, who tried every means to demolish the rising fortifications, there was some danger attending a settlement in Jerusalem. Hence the greater part of the returned exiles, in order to earn as well as secure the rewards of their duty, preferred to remain in the country or the provincial towns. To remedy this state of things, it was resolved to select every tenth man of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin by lot, to become a permanent inhabitant of the capital. The necessity of such an expedient commended it to the general approval. It was the more readily submitted to because the lot was resorted to on all the most critical conjunctures of the Jewish history, and regarded by the people as a divine decision (Pr 18:18). This awakened strongly the national spirit; and patriotic volunteers came forward readily to meet the wishes of the authorities, a service which, implying great self-denial as well as courage, was reckoned in the circumstances of so much importance as entitled them to the public gratitude. No wonder that the conduct of these volunteers drew forth the tribute of public admiration; for they sacrificed their personal safety and comfort for the interests of the community because Jerusalem was at that time a place against which the enemies of the Jews were directing a thousand plots. Therefore, residence in it at such a juncture was attended with expense and various annoyances from which a country life was entirely free.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Because they denied themselves, and their own safety and profit, for the public good; for this city was the butt of all the malicious plots of their enemies; and for the present it was rather chargeable than beneficial to its inhabitants; whereas the country did more easily and certainly afford them supplies. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the people blessed all the men that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem. Who were not taken by lot, but of their own accord settled at Jerusalem; they praised them for it, and wished them all happiness and prosperity, since they denied themselves of ease and profit for the sake of the public good; and it is this which makes the difference between the list of the inhabitants of Jerusalem in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-2.htm">1 Chronicles 9:2</a> &amp;c. and this here, that takes in all that settled there, whether voluntarily or by lot; this only such as were fixed by the lot, and of them only those who were of greatest note and esteem, as Jarchi observes, and so it follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nehemiah/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">that willingly offered themselves</span>] Another group is here distinguished, i.e. those who volunteered to go and dwell in Jerusalem. They are not to be confused with those who were sent there, being chosen ‘by lot.’ They went of their own accord, moved by public spirit. The blessing of their countrymen shows the enthusiasm aroused by their patriotic action; at the same time, it may denote that residence in Jerusalem was recognised to be fraught with danger. To dwell in the ‘holy city’ was also to defend it from its many enemies, see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-4.htm" title="Now the city was large and great: but the people were few therein, and the houses were not built.">Nehemiah 7:4</a>. It is not stated that they were accepted as substitutes for those chosen by lot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to this explanation we are told in these two verses of three classes of dwellers in Jerusalem: (<span class="ital">a</span>) the princes, (<span class="ital">b</span>) ten per cent. of the inhabitants of the other towns selected by lot and forcibly transferred, and (<span class="ital">c</span>) those who voluntarily migrated to the capital.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The men that willingly offered themselves</span>. Besides those on whom the lot fell, a certain number volunteered to change their residence and to transfer themselves and families from their country homes to Jerusalem. The people called down blessings upon them for their patriotism. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And we cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people for the wood-offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after our houses, at times appointed, year by year, to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God, as it is written in the law." In the law we merely find it prescribed that wood should be constantly burning on the altar, and that the priest should burn wood on it every morning, and burn thereon the burnt-offering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-12.htm">Leviticus 6:12</a>.). The law gave no directions concerning the procuring of the wood; yet the rulers of the people must, at all events, have always provided for the regular delivery of the necessary quantity. Nehemiah now gives orders, as he himself tells us, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm">Nehemiah 13:31</a>, which make this matter the business of the congregation, and the several houses have successively to furnish a contribution, in the order decided by casting lots. The words, "at times appointed, year by year," justify the conclusion that the order was settled for several years, and not that all the different houses contributed in each year.<p>(Note: Josephus (bello Jud. ii. 17. 6) speaks of a &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;, which he places on the fourteenth day of the month &#x39b;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, i.e., Ab, the fifth month of the Jewish year. From this Bertheau infers that the plural &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-31.htm">Nehemiah 13:31</a>, denotes the one season or day of delivery in each year. But though the name of this festival is derived from the present verse, the lxx translating &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1497;&#1501; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503; &#1492;&#1506;&#1510;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;, &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3be;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;, it appears even from what Josephus says of this feast, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b7;&#788;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b2;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, that the feast of wood-carrying does not designate that one day of the year on which the wood was delivered for the service of the altar. According to Mishna Taanit, ch. 4 (in Lightfoot's horae hebraicae in Matth. i. 1), nine days in the year were appointed for the delivery of wood, viz., 1st Nisan, 20th Tammuz, 5th, 7th, and 10th Ab, etc. Further particulars are given in Lundius, jd. Heiligtmer, p. 1067f. The feast of wood-carrying may be compared with our harvest festival; and Bertheau's inference is not more conclusive than would be the inference that our harvest festival denotes the one day in the year on which the harvest is gathered in.)</body></html>
