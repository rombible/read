Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is difficult to say what office Pethahiah filled.

Pethahiah was in some sort of way an official representative of Jewish interests in connexion with the Persian court. The suggestion (of Reuss) that he resided at Jerusalem, and was the official recipient of the provincial tribute might derive support from the mention of ‘the house of the king’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-25.htm" title="Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall, and the tower which lies out from the king's high house, that was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh.">Nehemiah 3:25</a>. But it is hard to see how any Jewish official of the Persian court, if he resided in Jerusalem, could be said to be ‘at the king’s hand in all matters concerning the people’ in any sense which would not much rather be applicable to Nehemiah himself. Indeed, if this official was a resident in Jerusalem, it is not easy to believe that the time of Nehemiah’s governorship can be referred to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If he was the Jewish representative at Susa it constitutes an isolated reference in this chapter to a person dwelling outside the borders of Judea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In spite of this objection it seems more probable that ‘at the king’s hand’ denotes personal residence at the Persian court.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The mention of the fact is parenthetically added in connexion with the royal mandate favourable to the Levites and the singers; and is not therefore, strictly speaking, relevant to the list. The phrase ‘at the hand of’ seems to denote personal attendance, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-13.htm" title="And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office was to distribute to their brothers.">Nehemiah 13:13</a> ‘next to them,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1 Chronicles 18:17</a> ‘And the sons of David were chief about (lit. ‘at the hand of,’ Vulg. ‘ad manum’) the king,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-28.htm" title="Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the work of the service of the house of God;">1 Chronicles 23:28</a> ‘their office was to wait on (lit. ‘at the hand of,’ LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ χεῖρα</span>, Vulg. ‘sub manu’) the sons of Aaron.’ In our verse the LXX. renders <span class="greekheb">πρὸς χεῖρα</span>, the Vulg. ‘in manu.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Pethahiah...  of the children of Zerah</span>. We have here an indication of the imperfection of the preceding catalogue, which has mentioned no descendants of Zerah among the Jews dwelling in Jerusalem, but made them all sons of Perez (ver. 6). As already observed, a verse equivalent to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-9.htm">1 Chronicles 6:9</a> must have fallen out between vers. 6 and 7 of this chapter. The exact office borne by Pethahiah cannot be determined; but he evidently held a confidential position, which made him an intermediary for certain purposes between the Persian king and the Jewish people. Perhaps he received and forwarded petitions and complaints. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of Levites, Shemaiah, a descendant of Bunni, with the members of his house; Shabbethai and Jozabad, "of the heads of the Levites over the outward business of the house of God," i.e., two heads of the Levites who had the care of the outward business of the temple, probably charged with the preservation of the building and furniture, and the office of seeing that all things necessary for the temple worship were duly delivered. The names Shabbethai and Jozabad have already occurred, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>, as those of two Levites, and are here also personal names of heads of Levites, as the addition &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; informs us. As the office of these two is stated, so also is that of those next following in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>; whence it appears that Shemaiah, of whom no such particular is given, was head of the Levites charged with attending on the priests at the sacrificial worship (the &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>). The three named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>, Mattaniah an Asaphite, Bakbukiah, and Abda a Jeduthunite, are the chiefs of the three Levitical orders of singers. Mattaniah is called &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, head of the beginning, which gives no meaning; and should probably, as in the lxx and Vulgate, be read &#1492;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;: head of the songs of praise, - he praised for who praised, i.e., sounded the Hodu for prayer; comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>, where Asaph is called the chief of the band of singers. He is followed by Bakbukiah as second, that is, leader of the second band (&#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1497;&#1493; &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; like &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;,   <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-5.htm">1 Chronicles 16:5</a>); and Abda the Jeduthunite, as leader of the third. All the Levites in the holy city, i.e., all who dwelt in Jerusalem, amounted to two hundred and eighty-four individuals or fathers of families. The number refers only to the three classes named <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-15.htm">Nehemiah 11:15-17</a>.
