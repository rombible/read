Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the ruler of the house of God&#8212;assistant of the high priest (Nu 3:32; 1Ch 9:11; 2Ch 19:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and two,....
