Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The business intended was probably the internal business, as distinct from the "outward business" <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-16.htm">Nehemiah 11:16</a> : a part of which was the apportionment of the royal bounty among the members of the choir <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-23.htm">Nehemiah 11:23</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the business of the house of God&#8212;They were selected to take charge of providing those things which were required for the interior of the temple and its service, while to others was committed the care of the "outward business of the house of God" (Ne 11:16).

The names Shabbethai and Jozabad have already occurred, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a>, as those of two Levites, and are here also personal names of heads of Levites, as the addition &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; informs us. As the office of these two is stated, so also is that of those next following in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-17.htm">Nehemiah 11:17</a>; whence it appears that Shemaiah, of whom no such particular is given, was head of the Levites charged with attending on the priests at the sacrificial worship (the &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-22.htm">Nehemiah 11:22</a>).
