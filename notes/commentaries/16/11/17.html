Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The principal to begin the thanksgiving - i. e., "the precentor," or "leader of the choir."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer&#8212;that is, the leader of the choir which chanted the public praise at the time of the morning and evening sacrifice.

The Hebrew for ‘the chief to begin’ is literally ‘the head of the beginning (<span class="ital">t’khillah</span>) who used to give thanks to the prayer’ i.e. after it. The LXX. and Vulg. Vss. follow a text, which differs in one letter, ‘the head of the praise’ (<span class="ital">t’hillah</span>), and gives a good sense, viz. ‘the head or leader of praise, one who gave thanks in the time of prayer,’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἄρχων τοῦ αἴνου καὶ Ἰούδας τῆς προσευχῆς</span>; Vulg. ‘princeps ad laudandum et ad confitendum in oratione.’) But the obscurity of the Hebrew phrase probably arises from its having been a technical title of the leader of the Temple choir, a choregus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Bakbukiah the second among his brethren</span>] i.e. second to Mattaniah.
