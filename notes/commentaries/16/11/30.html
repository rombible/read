Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Many of the places mentioned in these verses are mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-27.htm">Joshua 15:27-39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21-28</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. some of the children of Judah dwelt at Kirjath-arba&#8212;The whole region in which the villages here mentioned were situated had been completely devastated by the Chaldean invasion; and, therefore, it must be assumed, that these villages had been rebuilt before "the children dwelt in them."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And for the villages, with their fields,....

That this list is of later date than the days of Nehemiah, is a probable inference from a comparison of the numerous towns described in this chapter as being occupied by the men of Judah, with the few names of towns, which, if we may so understand the allusions in chap. 3, were occupied by Jews, at the time of the rebuilding of the walls, i.e. Jericho, Tekoa, Gibeon, Mizpah, Zanoah, Beth-haccerem, Beth-zur, Keilah.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Zanoah</span> and <span class="cmt_word">Adullam</span> appear in close connection with Jarmuth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-34.htm">Joshua 15:34, 35</a>. Zanoah was not a place of any importance, but Adullam, near which was David's cave, is often mentioned. It had its own king in the time of Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-7.htm">2 Chronicles 11:7</a>), and remained a city of some strength under the Maccabees (2 Macc. 12:38). <span class="cmt_word">Lachish</span> is a place even more celebrated than Adullam. Its king, Japhia, warred with Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-3.htm">Joshua 12:3-16</a>). It was fortified by Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-9.htm">2 Chronicles 11:9</a>). Amaziah took refuge there when conspiracy threatened him at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-19.htm">2 Kings 14:19</a>); and Sennacherib "besieged it with all his power" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/22-9.htm">2 Chronicles 22:9</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Azekah</span> is joined with Jarmuth and Adullam in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-35.htm">Joshua 15:35</a>.
