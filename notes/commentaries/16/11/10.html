Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. overseer&#8212;that is, "captain" or "chief."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Who dwelt in Jerusalem, of whom the same account is given in these two verses as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>, only Seraiah here is called Azariah there. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/nehemiah/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/nehemiah/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin</span>] The parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm" title="And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,">1 Chronicles 9:10</a> has ‘Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, Jachin.’ As these three are the names of well-known priestly houses (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-7.htm" title="Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to Jedaiah,">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>, Jehoiarib the first, Jedaiah the second, Jachin the one and twentieth in the twenty-four), ‘the son of’ may possibly be an interpolation.

Rather, "Of the priests, Jedaiah, Joiarib, Jachin." The word ben, "son," has once more accidentally crept in (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-10.htm">1 Chronicles 9:10</a>). The writer here passes from personal to famfiy names. Jedaiah and Joiarib were two of the chief priestly families, and are usually mentioned together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-7.htm">1 Chronicles 24:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-6.htm">Nehemiah 12:6, 19</a>, etc.). Jachin was a priestly family of much less distinction, descended probably from the head of the twenty-first course in David's time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-17.htm">1 Chronicles 24:17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the children of Judah two heads: Athaiah of the children of Perez (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-4.htm">1 Chronicles 2:4</a>), and Maaseiah of the children of Shela.

Athaiah and Maaseiah are not further known. There were in all four hundred and sixty-eight able-bodied men of the sons of Perez, i.e., four hundred and sixty-eight fathers of families of the race of Perez, among whom are probably included the fathers of families belonging to Shela, the younger brother of Perez. </body></html>
