Even the professors of religion too commonly seek their own, and not the things of Christ. Few have had such attachment to holy things and holy places, as to renounce pleasure for their sake. Yet surely, our souls should delight to dwell where holy persons and opportunities of spiritual improvement most abound. If we have not this love to the city of our God, and to every thing that assists our communion with the Saviour, how shall we be willing to depart hence; to be absent from the body, that we may be present with the Lord? To the carnal-minded, the perfect holiness of the New Jerusalem would be still harder to bear than the holiness of God's church on earth. Let us seek first the favour of God, and his glory; let us study to be patient, contented, and useful in our several stations, and wait, with cheerful hope, for admission into the holy city of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin reference notes. Both accounts appear to be extracts from a public official register which Nehemiah caused to be made of his census. The census itself seems to have been confined to the dwellers at Jerusalem. The subjoined table exhibits the differences between the accounts of the entire population of Jerusalem as given in Nehemiah and in Chronicles:<p> 1 Chron ehemiah  Tribes of Judah    Of Pharez  468  Of Zerah 690   Tribe of Benjamin 956 928  Tribe of Levi    Priests 1760 1192  Levites  284  Porters 212 172  <p>According to Nehemiah's numbers, supplemented from Chronicles, the entire adult male population of the city was 3,734, which would give a total population of 14,936. According to Chronicles, supplemented from Nehemiah, the adult males were 4,370, and consequently the entire population, would have been 17,480. As the Nethinims and the Israelites of Ephraim and Manasseh <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-3.htm">1 Chronicles 9:3</a> are not included in either list, we may conclude that the actual number of the inhabitants, after the efforts recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-1.htm">Nehemiah 11:1-2</a>, was not much short of 20,000.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. the ruler of the house of God&#8212;assistant of the high priest (Nu 3:32; 1Ch 9:11; 2Ch 19:11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">One of the chief priests; </span> who ruled with and under the high priest: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-32.htm" title="And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that keep the charge of the sanctuary.">Numbers 3:32</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-11.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, the ruler of the house of God;">1 Chronicles 9:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-11.htm" title="And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also the Levites shall be officers before you.

If so, the names have possibly been accidentally confused, either through similarity of sound or through corruption in the original text from which the lists were taken. Very probably they were father and son; and the two lists have selected different names to represent the priestly house. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/7-13.htm" title="The sons of Naphtali; Jahziel, and Guni, and Jezer, and Shallum, the sons of Bilhah.">1 Chronicles 7:13</a>, ‘Hilkiah begat Azariah; and Azariah begat Jeraiah.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Meraioth</span>] In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-7.htm" title="Meraioth begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,">1 Chronicles 6:7</a>, Meraioth is the grandfather of Ahitub, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-3.htm" title="The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,">Ezra 7:3</a> the great-grandfather. But in these genealogies names were freely left out for brevity, and the exact relationship by succession cannot be determined. Names also are repeated in the same family. Meraioth probably occurred often in the line of Seraiah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>was <span class="ital">the ruler of the house of God</span>] R.V. omits <span class="ital">was</span>. The same title occurs in connexion curiously enough with the same proper name in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-13.htm" title="And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and Azariah the ruler of the house of God.">2 Chronicles 31:13</a>, ‘And Azariah the ruler of the house of God.’ It is tempting to suggest that Azariah’s name has been substituted for that of Seraiah from a gloss on ‘the ruler of the house of God.’ If the title is equivalent to that of the High-priest, then Seraiah is the well-known High-priest, the ancestor of Ezra, put to death by Nebuchadnezzar (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-1.htm" title="Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,">Ezra 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-18.htm" title="And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door:">2 Kings 25:18</a>). For the use of the title ‘n’gîd’ (Vulg. ‘princeps’), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-27.htm" title="And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him were three thousand and seven hundred;">1 Chronicles 12:27</a>, ‘Jehoiada … leader of the house of Aaron.’ But it may denote only a special officer of the Temple.
