We must never suffer ourselves to be overcome, by repeated urgency, to do anything sinful or imprudent; but when attacked with the same temptation, must resist it with the same reason and resolution. It is common for that which is desired only by the malicious, to be falsely represented by them as desired by the many. But Nehemiah knew at what they aimed, he not only denied that such things were true, but that they were reported; he was better known than to be thus suspected. We must never omit any known duty for fear it should be misconstrued; but, while we keep a good conscience, let us trust God with our good name. God's people, though loaded with reproach, are not really fallen so low in reputation as some would have them thought to be. Nehemiah lifted up his heart to Heaven in a short prayer. When, in our Christian work and warfare, we enter upon any service or conflict, this is a good prayer, I have such a duty to do, such a temptation to grapple with; now, therefore, O God, strengthen my hands. Every temptation to draw us from duty, should quicken us the more to duty.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The choice made of Ono, on the skirts of Benjamin, 25 or 30 miles from Jerusalem, as the meeting-place, was, no doubt, in order to draw Nehemiah to a distance from his supporters, that so an attack might be made on him with a better chance of success. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. Then Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me&#8212;The Samaritan leaders, convinced that they could not overcome Nehemiah by open arms, resolved to gain advantage over him by deceit and stratagem. With this in view, under pretext of terminating their differences in an amicable manner, they invited him to a conference. The place of rendezvous was fixed "in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono." "In the villages" is, Hebrew, "in Cephirim," or "Chephirah," the name of a town in the territory of Benjamin (Jos 9:17; 18:26). Nehemiah, however, apprehensive of some intended mischief, prudently declined the invitation. Though it was repeated four times, [Nehemiah's] uniform answer was that his presence could not be dispensed with from the important work in which he was engaged. This was one, though not the only, reason. The principal ground of his refusal was that his seizure or death at their hands would certainly put a stop to the further progress of the fortifications.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let us meet together; </span> to consult about the common service of our master the king of Persia, or to make a friendly accommodation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ono; </span> a city in the tribe of Benjamin; of which see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-35.htm" title="Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.">Nehemiah 11:35</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-12.htm" title="The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:">1 Chronicles 8:12</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me,....

Some commentators have held that this omission is to be accounted for by the fact of Tobiah being ‘the mere servant of Sanballat’ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm" title="When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.">Nehemiah 2:10</a>). But the explanation seems very improbable when we consider the prominence of Tobiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-10.htm" title="When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.">Nehemiah 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm" title="But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?">Nehemiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm" title="But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,">Nehemiah 4:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm" title="Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them.">Nehemiah 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-19.htm" title="Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-7.htm" title="And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God....">Nehemiah 13:7-8</a>, and the way in which his name is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-12.htm" title="And, see, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.">Nehemiah 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>. It is better to suppose that Nehemiah’s enemies deputed two of the most crafty of their number to make these overtures for an interview. An invitation to meet and discuss matters with only two of the leaders would wear a friendly and innocent appearance. Perhaps Tobiah and the other conspirators were intended to take advantage of Nehemiah’s absence and to make a surprise attack upon Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in</span> some one of <span class="ital">the villages</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">in one of the villages.</span> According to this translation the invitation leaves it open to Nehemiah to select the place of meeting. But literally the Hebrew gives ‘in the villages (Chephirim)’. It is very possible that this word gives the name of a place (cf. Chephirah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-25.htm" title="The children of Kirjatharim, Chephirah, and Beeroth, seven hundred and forty and three.">Ezra 2:25</a>), as Rashi long ago suggested. It is certainly natural to expect that Sanballat and Geshem would name a place for the proposed interview; and the form of the Hebrew word favours this explanation. The proposed meeting-place then would be ‘Hacchephirim.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the plain of Ono</span>] On Ono, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-33.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and five.">Ezra 2:33</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-37.htm" title="The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and one.">Nehemiah 7:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-35.htm" title="Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.">Nehemiah 11:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-12.htm" title="The sons of Elpaal; Eber, and Misham, and Shamed, who built Ono, and Lod, with the towns thereof:">1 Chronicles 8:12</a>). An interview in the plain of Ono would have necessitated Nehemiah’s absence from Jerusalem during three or four days. The object of his enemies was doubtless to seize or assassinate him at a distance from Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thought to do me mischief</span>] ‘thought’ i.e. ‘considered how.’ Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-6.htm" title="Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and Gashmu said it, that you and the Jews think to rebel: for which cause you build the wall, that you may be their king, according to these words.">Nehemiah 6:6</a>, ‘<span class="ital">think</span> to rebel.’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-20.htm" title="But as for you, you thought evil against me; but God meant it to good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much people alive.">Genesis 50:20</a>, ‘ye <span class="ital">thought</span> (R.V. <span class="ital">meant</span>) evil against me.’ ‘Mischief,’ lit. ‘evil,’ by which expression Nehemiah hints that his foes plotted to assassinate him. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And David knew that Saul secretly practiced mischief against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, Bring here the ephod.">1 Samuel 23:9</a>, ‘Saul devised mischief.’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-3.htm" title="And Esther spoke yet again before the king, and fell down at his feet, and sought him with tears to put away the mischief of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised against the Jews.">Esther 8:3</a>, ‘the mischief of Haman the Agagite.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In some one of the villages</span>. The Hebrew has "in the villages," which seems too vague.

The meaning ultra, praeter, besides (EW. 217, 1), can no more be shown to be that of &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, than over can, which Bertheau attempts to justify by saying that after forty shekels follow forty-one, forty-two, etc. The interpretation, too: reckoned after money (Bttcher, de Inferis, 409, b, and N. krit. Aehrenl. iii. p. 219), cannot be supported by the passages quoted in its behalf, since in none of them is &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; used de illo quod normae est, but has everywhere fundamentally the local signification after. Why, then, should not &#1488;&#1495;&#1512; be here used adverbially, afterwards, and express the thought that this money was afterwards demanded from the community for the expenses of the governor's table? "Even their servants bare rule over the people." &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1496; denotes arbitrary, oppressive rule, abuse of power for extortions, etc. Nehemiah, on the contrary, had not thus acted because of the fear of God.</body></html>
