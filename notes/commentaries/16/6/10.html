This man—probably a priest—Nehemiah found shut up in his house; probably he sent for the governor, and represented himself as being in danger from the common enemy. He predicted that on the night ensuing an attempt would be made on Nehemiah’s life, and proposed that they should meet “within the Temple”—that is, in the holy place, between the Holiest and the outer court—for security.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/nehemiah/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm" title="Afterward I came to the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay you; yes, in the night will they come to slay you.">Nehemiah 6:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">I came into the house of Shemaiah — </span>Who was a pretended prophet, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-12.htm" title="And, see, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.">Nehemiah 6:12</a>, and taken by Nehemiah for his friend, who therefore went to advise and consult with him at his house. <span class="ital">Who was shut up — </span>In his chamber adjoining to the temple, either upon pretence of singular devotion and communion with God, or rather of having received certain knowledge, by the Spirit of God, of their approaching danger, from which they could be safe nowhere but in the temple.

Thus he hoped to intimidate Nehemiah, and thereby to strike a dread into all the people, and put a speedy and full stop to the work; which effect would indeed have been produced if Nehemiah had taken his advice, and through fear shut himself up: for then the people would have left their work, and every one have shifted for his own safety. He probably hoped also by this means to render Nehemiah contemptible among the people, by manifesting such cowardice as to desert his post and take refuge in the temple in time of danger; and by all these things to prepare the way for the enemies to assault and take the city.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:10-14 The greatest mischief our enemies can do us, is, to frighten us from our duty, and to lead us to do what is sinful. Let us never decline a good work, never do a bad one. We ought to try all advice, and to reject what is contrary to the word of God. Every man should study to be consistent. Should I, a professed Christian, called to be a saint, a child of God, a member of Christ, a temple of the Holy Ghost, should I be covetous, sensual, proud, or envious? Should I yield to impatience, discontent, or anger? Should I be slothful, unbelieving, or unmerciful? What effects will such conduct have upon others? All that God has done for us, or by us, or given to us, should lead us to watchfulness, self-denial, and diligence.

Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah, &c.&#8212;This man was the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post, and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in consequence of his Jewish connections (Ne 6:18), the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in troublous times (Da 9:25) was happily completed (Ne 6:15) in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shemaiah the son of Delaiah; </span> probably one of the chief of the priests, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-26.htm" title="The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah; Beno.">1 Chronicles 24:26</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Who was shut up</span> in his chamber adjoining to the temple, upon pretence of singular devotion, sequestration from the world, and special acquaintance and much communion with God in his retirements, after the manner of the prophets; and withal upon pretence of certain knowledge, which he had by the Spirit of God and of prophecy, concerning their approaching danger, from which they could be safe no where but in the temple, which the very heathens owned for a sanctuary, which they might not violate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple; </span> for the danger is so near, that we cannot safely tarry here so long as to consult what to do in this juncture. His design herein was, partly, to discourage and disgrace Nehemiah, and thereby to strike a dread into all the people, and give a speedy and full stop to the work; partly, to prepare the way for the enemies to assault and take the city, whilst Nehemiah was shut up, and unable to give them any opposition; partly, to justify their accusation of Nehemiah to the king by his flight upon it; and partly, that there, by the help of other priests, who were conscious of his plot, he might either destroy him, or secure his person, till the city by some of his accomplices were betrayed into the enemy’s hands. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up,....

(LXX. <span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς συνεχόμενος</span>. Vulg. <span class="ital">secreto</span>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) According to one view, he was ‘shut up’ in the sense that he was prevented by ceremonial pollution from mixing in the society of his countrymen or from approaching the Temple. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-1.htm" title="Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet shut up in the court of the prison, saying,">Jeremiah 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-5.htm" title="And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up; I cannot go into the house of the LORD:">Jeremiah 36:5</a>. Accepting this interpretation, we see in his proposal to Nehemiah the extremity of his alarms real or feigned.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) According to another view, the expression is metaphorical, and denotes that he was a ‘prisoner,’ in the sense of being ‘possessed by’ the prophetic spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) According to a third view, he had shut himself up in his house in order to show by a symbolical action that Nehemiah was prophetically warned to take refuge in some hiding-place. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm" title="And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made him horns of iron: and he said, Thus said the LORD, With these shall you push the Syrians, until you have consumed them.">1 Kings 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/28-10.htm" title="Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.">Jeremiah 28:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">within the temple … doors of the temple</span>] Shemaiah’s proposal is that Nehemiah should hide himself in sacred precincts, where only priests could go. He implies that this advice which he gives as a prophet is sufficient sanction to absolve the act of profanation. The safety of the governor, he seems to say, is of more importance than a detail of ceremonial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yea, in the night</span>, &c.] The repetition of the clauses has all the ring of poetic parallelism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘They will come.’ The indefiniteness of the oracular utterance does not state who the assassins are.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11</span> <span class="ital">And I said</span>] Nehemiah refuses to listen to Shemaiah. (1) He has his duty and position as governor to remember; it is not for him to show the white feather. (2) The proposal to take refuge in the Temple is monstrous; it was forbidden by the Law, which he served, and to trespass upon the domain of the priests was impious in the extreme. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense....">2 Chronicles 26:16-20</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Should such a man as I</span>] The governor and the leader of the national movement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>being as <span class="ital">I</span> am] R.V. <span class="bld">being such as I,</span> i.e. not a Priest, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,">Nehemiah 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-3.htm" title="And said to the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchers, lies waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?">Nehemiah 2:3</a>, but the Governor responsible for the protection of his countrymen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">would go into the temple to save his life</span>] R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">could go into the temple and live</span>’. According to the A.V. and R.V. text the words ‘and live’ are made to depend upon the verb ‘go,’ and denote the purpose of the action ‘to save his life.’ According to the rendering of the R.V. marg., which is more probable, the words ‘and live’ (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm" title="And you said, Behold, the LORD our God has showed us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the middle of the fire: we have seen this day that God does talk with man, and he lives.">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>) are coordinate with ‘go,’ and represent the main thought of astonished enquiry. The Law declared that the stranger, i.e. ‘the layman that cometh nigh shall be put to death,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-7.htm" title="Therefore you and your sons with you shall keep your priest's office for everything of the altar, and within the veil; and you shall serve: I have given your priest's office to you as a service of gift: and the stranger that comes near shall be put to death.">Numbers 18:7</a>. Nehemiah’s words point to this prohibition, binding against the governor as much as against the poorest of the Israelites. He does not quote a written statute, but appeals to what was generally known and recognised as law.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - A <span class="cmt_word">Shemaiah</span> appears in the list of priests who afterwards signed the covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-8.htm">Nehemiah 10:8</a>); but the names in that list do not appear to be personal.
