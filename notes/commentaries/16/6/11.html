Let us never decline a good work, never do a bad one. We ought to try all advice, and to reject what is contrary to the word of God. Every man should study to be consistent. Should I, a professed Christian, called to be a saint, a child of God, a member of Christ, a temple of the Holy Ghost, should I be covetous, sensual, proud, or envious? Should I yield to impatience, discontent, or anger? Should I be slothful, unbelieving, or unmerciful? What effects will such conduct have upon others? All that God has done for us, or by us, or given to us, should lead us to watchfulness, self-denial, and diligence. Next to the sinfulness of sin, we should dread the scandal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Would go into the temple to save his life - Rather "could go into the temple and live."

Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah, &c.&#8212;This man was the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post, and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in consequence of his Jewish connections (Ne 6:18), the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in troublous times (Da 9:25) was happily completed (Ne 6:15) in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Should such a man as I flee; </span> I the chief governor, upon whose presence, and counsel, and conduct the very life and being of the whole city and nation in a great measure depends; I who have professed such resolution, and courage, and confidence in God; I who have had such eminent experience of God’s gracious and powerful assistances, of his calling me to this employment, and carrying me through it when our danger was greater than now it is.

Dean Stanley compares Becket's noble words, - "I will not turn the cathedral into a castle," - but the parallel is not close. Nehemiah feels, not that he would profane the temple by making it into a place of refuge, but that he would break the law by simply entering it. Ewald shows that he has caught the point of the objection when he says, "Nehemiah thought that, as a <span class="accented">layman</span>, he must not break the Divine command by entering the sanctuary itself" ('History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 157). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then Sanballat sent his servant in this manner, the fifth time, with an open letter, in which was written: "It is reported (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, it is heard) among the nations, and Gashmu saith, (that) thou and the Jews intend to rebel; for which cause thou buildest the wall, and thou wilt be their king, according to these words."
