Let us never decline a good work, never do a bad one. We ought to try all advice, and to reject what is contrary to the word of God. Every man should study to be consistent. Should I, a professed Christian, called to be a saint, a child of God, a member of Christ, a temple of the Holy Ghost, should I be covetous, sensual, proud, or envious? Should I yield to impatience, discontent, or anger? Should I be slothful, unbelieving, or unmerciful? What effects will such conduct have upon others? All that God has done for us, or by us, or given to us, should lead us to watchfulness, self-denial, and diligence. Next to the sinfulness of sin, we should dread the scandal.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The existence of a party among the Jews who sided with Sanballat and lent themselves to his schemes, is here for the first time indicated.

Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah, &c.&#8212;This man was the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post, and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in consequence of his Jewish connections (Ne 6:18), the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in troublous times (Da 9:25) was happily completed (Ne 6:15) in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I perceived; </span> partly, by considering the sinful nature and pernicious consequence of this counsel; partly, by the suggestion of God’s Spirit, whose counsel and help I sought in this matter; and partly, by the event, which discovered that there was no such danger from the approach of the enemy as was pretended. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him,....

The interjection ‘and, lo,’ follows after the recognition of Shemaiah’s character and intent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God had not sent him</span>] The emphasis lies on ‘God,’ i.e. it was not God that sent him, but Sanballat and his party.

He had ‘discerned’ (1) that Shemaiah’s message was not of God, (2) that its purpose was hostile to himself, (3) that it was the result of bribery on the part of Tobiah and Sanballat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the first statement that Tobiah and Sanballat were in communication with a party in Jerusalem itself hostile to Nehemiah, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/6-17.htm" title="Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came to them....">Nehemiah 6:17-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:">Nehemiah 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm" title="And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.">Nehemiah 13:28</a>. ‘Tobiah and Sanballat.’ The usual order of the names is inverted, it has been suggested, because ‘Tobiah was the immediate briber, Sanballat only finding the funds’ (<span class="ital">Pulpit Comm</span>.). More probably, however, his name stands first in this passage because in intrigues with the Jews of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm" title="And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of the chamber of the house of our God, was allied to Tobiah:">Nehemiah 13:4</a> ff.) he was the more active and dangerous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hired</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-5.htm" title="And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.">Ezra 4:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And, lo, I perceived</span>, etc. Rather, "And I considered; and lo!
