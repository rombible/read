A great deal of work may be done in a little time, if we set about it in earnest, and keep close to it. See the mischief of marrying with strangers. When men once became akin to Tobiah, they soon became sworn to him. A sinful love leads to a sinful league. The enemy of souls employs many instruments, and forms many projects, to bring reproach on the active servants of God, or to take them from their work. But we should follow the example of Him who laid down his life for the sheep. Those that simply cleave to the Lord and his work will be supported.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Elul - The sixth month, corresponding to the latter part of August and the beginning of September.<p>In fifty and two days - Josephus states that the repairs of the wall occupied two years and four months. But Nehemiah's narrative is thoroughly consistent with itself, and contains in it nothing that is improbable. The walls everywhere existed at the time that he commenced his task, and only needed repairs. The work was partitioned among at least 37 working parties, who labored simultaneously, with material ready at hand; and, notwithstanding all menaces, uninterruptedly. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-14. Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah, &c.&#8212;This man was the son of a priest, who was an intimate and confidential friend of Nehemiah. The young man claimed to be endowed with the gift of prophecy. Having been secretly bribed by Sanballat, he, in his pretended capacity of prophet, told Nehemiah that his enemies were that night to make an attempt upon his life. He advised him, at the same time, to consult his safety by concealing himself in the sanctuary, a crypt which, from its sanctity, was strong and secure. But the noble-minded governor determined at all hazards to remain at his post, and not bring discredit on the cause of God and religion by his unworthy cowardice in leaving the temple and city unprotected. This plot, together with a secret collusion between the enemy and the nobles of Judah who were favorably disposed towards the bad Samaritan in consequence of his Jewish connections (Ne 6:18), the undaunted courage and vigilance of Nehemiah were enabled, with the blessing of God, to defeat, and the erection of the walls thus built in troublous times (Da 9:25) was happily completed (Ne 6:15) in the brief space of fifty-two days. So rapid execution, even supposing some parts of the old wall standing, cannot be sufficiently accounted for, except by the consideration that the builders labored with the ardor of religious zeal, as men employed in the work of God.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In their own eyes, </span> i.e. in their opinion, or themselves being judges; for though ordinarily men are very prone to judge partially, and still to flatter themselves with vain hopes and fancies, yet this case was so clear and remarkable, that they began to despair.

Marg. ‘According to another reading, <span class="ital">saw</span>’. There is little distinction to be drawn between ‘the enemies’ and ‘the heathen.’ The leaders of the hostile races heard, and then the races themselves feared. The reading ‘feared,’ which is also that of the LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἐφοβήθησαν</span>, and the Vulg. ‘timerent,’ gives a preferable sense to ‘saw.’ The distinction in the A.V. between the ‘seeing’ of ‘the heathen’ and the ‘hearing’ of ‘the enemies’ is quite meaningless, and tells against that reading. The rendering of the R.V. suggests that the news first reached Tobiah, Sanballat and Geshem, and then spread a panic among the Moabites, Samaritans, Arabians, &c.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they were much cast down in their own eyes</span>] A peculiar expression which occurs only in this passage; literally, ‘they fell much in their own eyes.’ According to the present text, two explanations have been given: (<span class="ital">a</span>) = ‘they were much vexed and disconcerted.’ ‘To fall in one’s eyes’ is then to be compared with the ‘falling’ or ‘lowering’ of the countenance. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-5.htm" title="But to Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain was very wroth, and his countenance fell....">Genesis 4:5-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-32.htm" title="And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of him; your servant will go and fight with this Philistine.">1 Samuel 17:32</a>. (<span class="ital">b</span>) = ‘they had fallen greatly in their own estimation,’ i.e. they despised themselves. In their own eyes, i.e. in their own opinion, their power had received a heavy blow; they had ‘fallen,’ as it were, and the Jews were exalted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A different text is followed in the three renderings: (<span class="ital">a</span>) the LXX. ‘And fear fell upon their eyes exceedingly,’ <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπέπεσεν φόβος σφόδρα ἐν ὀφθαλμοῖς αὐτῶν</span>. (<span class="ital">b</span>) the Vulgate ‘et conciderent inter semet ipsos’ (<span class="ital">bayneyhem</span> for <span class="ital">b’ay-neyhem</span>). (<span class="ital">c</span>) ‘And they caused their eyes to fall’, with the same meaning as that given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-12.htm" title="Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, you backsliding Israel, said the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall on you: for I am merciful, said the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever.">Jeremiah 3:12</a>, ‘I will not look in anger upon you’ (marg. Heb. ‘cause my countenance to fall upon you’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">this work was wrought of our God</span>] In the completion of the wall the special favour of the God of Israel must have been recognised. What else could explain the unexpected commission from Artaxerxes at the beginning, and the frustration of all the machinations of the enemy? Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-2.htm" title="Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD has done great things for them.">Psalm 126:2</a>, ‘Then said they among the nations, The Lord hath done great things for them.’ For the phrase, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-23.htm" title="This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.">Psalm 118:23</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Our enemies</span>. The Samaritans, the Ammonites, the Ashdodites, and the Arabians under Oeshem are the special "enemies" here spoken cf. The Phoenicians, Syrians, Moabites, etc. are the other "heathen round about" the Jews. Even these last were unfriendly, and disliked any increase of Jewish power and prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">They perceived that this work was wrought of our God</span>. They could not but recognise a special Providence as befriending and protecting the Jews, who, after having been utterly crushed and rooted out by Nebuchadnezzar, were now re-established in a commanding position in Palestine, and allowed to make their city once more an almost impregnable fortress. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A false prophet, hired by Tobiah and Sanballat, also sought, by prophesying that the enemies of Nehemiah would kill him in the night, to cause him to flee with him into the holy place of the temple, and to protect his life from the machinations of his enemies by closing the temple doors. His purpose was, as Nehemiah subsequently learned, to seduce him into taking an illegal step, and so give occasion for speaking evil of him.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-10.htm">Nehemiah 6:10</a><p>"And I came into the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up." Nothing further is known of this prophet Shemaiah. From what is here related we learn, that he was one of the lying prophets employed by Sanballat and Tobiah to ruin Nehemiah. We are not told what induced or caused Nehemiah to go into the house of Shemaiah; he merely recounts what the latter was hired by his enemies to effect. From the accessory clause, "and he was shut up," we may perhaps infer that Shemaiah in some way or other, perhaps by announcing that he had something of importance to communicate, persuaded Nehemiah to visit him at his house. &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; does not, however, involved the meaning which Bertheau gives it, viz., that Nehemiah went to Shemaiah's house, because the latter as &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; could not come to him. The phrase says only, that when Nehemiah entered Shemaiah's house, he found him &#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, which simply means shut up, shut in his house, not imprisoned, and still less in a state of ceremonial uncleanness (Ewald), or overpowered by the hand of Jahve - laid hold on by a higher power (Bertheau). It is evident from his proposal to Nehemiah, "Let us go together to the house of God," etc., that he was neither imprisoned in his house, nor prevented by any physical cause from leaving home. Hence it follows that he had shut himself in his house, to intimate to Nehemiah that also he felt his life in danger through the machinations of his enemies, and that he was thus dissimulating in order the more easily to induce him to agree to his proposal, that they should together escape the snares laid for them by fleeing to the temple. In this case, it may be uncertain whether Shemaiah had shut himself up, feigning that the enemies of Judah were seeking his life also, as the prophet of Jahve; or whether by this action he was symbolically announcing what God charged him to make known to Nehemiah. Either view is possible; while the circumstance that Nehemiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-12.htm">Nehemiah 6:12</a> calls his advice to flee into the temple a &#1504;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; against him, and that it was quite in character with the proceedings of such false prophets to enforce their words by symbolical signs (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), favours the former. The going into the house of God is more closely defined by &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;, within the holy place; for they (the enemies) will come to slay thee, and indeed this night will they come to slay thee." He seeks to corroborate his warning as a special revelation from God, by making it appear that God had not only made known to him the design of the enemies, but also the precise time at which they intended to carry it into execution.</body></html>
