Let all who are in public places remember that they are so placed to do good, not to enrich themselves. Nehemiah mentions it to God in prayer, not as if he had merited any favour from God, but to show that he depended upon God only, to make up to him what he had lost and laid out for his honour. Nehemiah evidently spake and acted as one that knew himself to be a sinner. He did not mean to claim a reward as of debt, but in the manner that the Lord rewards a cup of cold water given to a disciple for his sake. The fear and love of God in the heart, and true love of the brethren, will lead to every good work. These are proper evidences of justifying faith; and our reconciled God will look upon persons of this character for good, according to all they have done for his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I continued ... land - i. e. - "I took my share in the work of the wall, as general superintendent.

He regularly entertained over 150 officials, and welcomed Jewish strangers to his table.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers, besides those that came unto us</span>, &c.] The English rendering which seems here to distinguish between ‘the Jews’ and ‘rulers’ (or ‘deputies’), and to speak of three classes (1) the Jews, (2) rulers, (3) strangers from outside Judæa, may be supported by the traditional interpretation preserved in the Hebrew accents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the position here assigned to ‘the Jews,’ the word, if taken to express a distinct class of the community, must be used of ‘the heads of the great Jewish houses or families’ (cf. Ezra 2) as distinct from the administrative officers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-16.htm" title="And the rulers knew not where I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.">Nehemiah 2:16</a>). According to this explanation the heads of the houses and the rulers together numbered one hundred and fifty.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be questioned whether the expression ‘the Jews’ would ever be assigned to a section or class of the community. The word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews.">Nehemiah 5:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us? Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.">Nehemiah 5:8</a> without any such limitation of meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is perhaps better to take ‘the Jews’ as the subject of the whole verse. ‘Moreover the Jews—I regularly entertained two classes, i.e. the 150 officials and those who had recently left their homes to join their countrymen at Jerusalem.’ This is the rendering of the Vulgate, ‘Judæi quoque et magistratus centum quinquaginta viri et veniebant ad nos de gentibus.’ The repetition of the copula in the Hebrew with ‘Jews,’ ‘rulers,’ and ‘those’ admits of this rendering as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm" title="And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the middle among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.">Nehemiah 4:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The large number of the ‘rulers’ is not an insurmountable objection to this rendering. The central organization of the administration required a great deal of subdivision; and as all the officials were under the governor, he extended his hospitality to all alike.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">besides those that came unto us</span>, &c.] By this seems to be intended the somewhat numerous class of Jews, who, having resided among the neighbouring nations detached themselves from time to time, and came to join their brethren in or near Jerusalem. These were Jews, whose forefathers had never been carried captive to Babylon, but had settled in foreign lands either for purposes of trade or from fear of the invader. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-21.htm" title="And the children of Israel, which were come again out of captivity, and all such as had separated themselves to them from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the LORD God of Israel, did eat,">Ezra 6:21</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that are about us</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">that were round about us.</span> The past tense is required by the narrative style, which Nehemiah employs.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">An hundred and fifty of the Jews and rulers</span>. The "hundred and fifty" were, all of them, "rulers." Nehemiah means to say that he entertained continually at his table 150 of the Jewish chief men or "rulers" (<span class="accented">segdnim</span>), and also an indefinite number of foreign Jews, who came on short visits to Jerusalem. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I, likewise my brethren and my servants (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-17.htm">Nehemiah 4:17</a>), have lent them money and corn; let us, I pray, remit (not ask back) this loan!" The participle &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; says: we are those who have lent. Herewith he connects the invitation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> : "Restore unto them, I pray you, even this day (&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;, about this day, i.e., even to-day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-13.htm">1 Samuel 9:13</a>), their fields, their vineyards, their olive gardens, and their houses, and the hundredth of the money, and of the corn, wine, and oil which you have lent them." Nehemiah requires, 1st, that those who held the lands of their poorer brethren in pledge should restore them their property without delay: 2nd, that they should remit to their debtors all interest owing on money, corn, etc. that had been lent; not, as the words have been frequently understood, that they should give back to their debtors such interest as they had already received. That the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-11.htm">Nehemiah 5:11</a> bear the former, and not the latter signification, is obvious from the reply, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-12.htm">Nehemiah 5:12</a>, of those addressed: "We will restore, sc. their lands, etc., and will not querie of them, sc. the hundredth; so will we do as thou sayest." Hence we must not translate &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "which you had taken from them as interest" (de Wette), - a translation which, moreover, cannot be justified by the usage of the language, for &#1489; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; does not mean to take interest from another, to lend to another on interest. The &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; relates not to &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514;, but to &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1492;&#1512; ... &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1490;&#1503;; and &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;, to restore, to make good, is used of both the transactions in question, meaning in the first clause the restoration of the lands retained as pledges, and in the second, the remission (the non-requirement) of the hundredth. The hundredth taken as interest is probably, like the centesima of the Romans, to be understood of a monthly payment. One per cent. per month was a very heavy interest, and one which, in the case of the poor, might be exorbitant. The law, moreover, forbade the taking of any usury from their brethren, their poor fellow-countrymen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>. When the creditors had given the consent required, Nehemiah called the priests, and made them (the creditors) swear to do according to this promise, i.e., conscientiously to adhere to their agreement. Nehemiah obtained the attendance of the priests, partly for the purpose of giving solemnity to the oath now taken, and partly to give to the declaration made in the presence of the priests legal validity for judicial decisions.</body></html>
