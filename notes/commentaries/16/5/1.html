This crime was the more heinous, because the twentieth of Artaxerxes, when this was done, began about the end of a sabbatic year, (as Dr. Alix observes,) which raised the cry of the poor to a greater height against their creditors, who exacted their debts of them contrary to the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm" title="And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>; which was read to them publicly in such a year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-12.htm" title="Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and your stranger that is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe to do all the words of this law:">Deuteronomy 31:12</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-5 Men prey upon their fellow-creatures: by despising the poor they reproach their Maker.

The People Complain of Their Debt, Mortgage, and Bondage.<p>1-5. there was a great cry of the people &#8230; against their brethren&#8212;Such a crisis in the condition of the Jews in Jerusalem&#8212;fatigued with hard labor and harassed by the machinations of restless enemies, the majority of them poor, and the bright visions which hope had painted of pure happiness on their return to the land of their fathers being unrealized&#8212;must have been very trying to their faith and patience. But, in addition to these vexatious oppressions, many began to sink under a new and more grievous evil. The poor made loud complaints against the rich for taking advantage of their necessities, and grinding them by usurious exactions. Many of them had, in consequence of these oppressions, been driven to such extremities that they had to mortgage their lands and houses to enable them to pay the taxes to the Persian government, and ultimately even to sell their children for slaves to procure the means of subsistence. The condition of the poorer inhabitants was indeed deplorable; for, besides the deficient harvests caused by the great rains (Ezr 10:9; also Hag 1:6-11), a dearth was now threatened by the enemy keeping such a multitude pent up in the city, and preventing the country people bringing in provisions.The people complain of their brethren, by reason of their debts, mortgages, and bondage, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/5-1.htm" title="And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brothers the Jews....">Nehemiah 5:1-5</a></span>.

Besides, of the circumstance of the weapons being placed behind the builders, so that they might at any moment seize them, we not only read nothing in the text; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm">Nehemiah 4:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-12.htm">Nehemiah 4:12</a> just the contrary, viz., that the builders wrought with one hand, and with the other held a weapon. "The rulers were behind all the house of Judah," i.e., each was behind his own people who were employed on the work, to encourage them in their labour, and, in case of attack, to lead them against the enemy. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm">Nehemiah 4:11</a> &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1492; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; is prefixed after the manner of a title. With respect to those who built the wall, both the bearers of burdens were lading with the one hand of each workman, and holding a weapon with the other, and the builders were building each with his sword girt on his side. The &#1493; prefixed to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; means both; and &#1489;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500; &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;, bearers of burdens, who cleared away the rubbish, and worked as labourers. These, at all events, could do their work with one hand, which would suffice for emptying rubbish into baskets, and for carrying material in handle baskets. &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1495;&#1514;, literally, with the one (namely) of his hands that was doing the work. The suffix of &#1497;&#1491;&#1493; points to the genitive following. &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1514; &#1488;&#1495;&#1514;, the one and the other hand. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;, not a missile, but a weapon that was stretched out, held forth, usually a sword or some defensive weapon: see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-8.htm">Joshua 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>. The builders, on the contrary, needed both hands for their work: hence they had swords girt to their sides. "And he that sounded the trumpet was beside me." Nehemiah, as superintendent of the work, stood at the head of his servants, ready to ward off any attack; hence the trumpeter was beside him, to be able to give to those employed on the wall the signal for speedy muster in case danger should threaten.</body></html>
