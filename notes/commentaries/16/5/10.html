The right way to reform men's lives, is to convince their consciences. If you walk in the fear of God, you will not be either covetous of worldly gain, or cruel toward your brethren. Nothing exposes religion more to reproach, than the worldliness and hard-heartedness of the professors of it. Those that rigorously insist upon their right, with a very ill grace try to persuade others to give up theirs. In reasoning with selfish people, it is good to contrast their conduct with that of others who are liberal; but it is best to point to His example, who though he was rich, yet for our sakes became poor, that we, through his poverty, might be rich, 2Co 8:9.

The Usurers Rebuked.<p>6-12. I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words&#8212;When such disorders came to the knowledge of the governor, his honest indignation was roused against the perpetrators of the evil. Having summoned a public assembly, he denounced their conduct in terms of just severity. He contrasted it with his own in redeeming with his money some of the Jewish exiles who, through debt or otherwise, had lost their personal liberty in Babylon. He urged the rich creditors not only to abandon their illegal and oppressive system of usury, but to restore the fields and vineyards of the poor, so that a remedy might be put to an evil the introduction of which had led to much actual disorder, and the continuance of which would inevitably prove ruinous to the newly restored colony, by violating the fundamental principles of the Hebrew constitution. The remonstrance was effectual. The conscience of the usurious oppressors could not resist the touching and powerful appeal. With mingled emotions of shame, contrition, and fear, they with one voice expressed their readiness to comply with the governor's recommendation. The proceedings were closed by the parties binding themselves by a solemn oath, administered by the priests, that they would redeem their pledge, as well as by the governor invoking, by the solemn and significant gesture of shaking a corner of his garment, a malediction on those who should violate it. The historian has taken care to record that the people did according to this promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My brethren, </span> to wit, in office; those who are employed with me in the government of this people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">My servants; </span> in my name, and for my use. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Might exact of them money and corn, </span> as a just recompence for our pains and care for the public good, to which we wholly devote ourselves, even to the neglect of all our private concerns.

The words are not, as A.V., ‘I … and my brethren, &c.’, but ‘I, my brethren, &c.’ Nehemiah takes the reply out of the mouth of his opponents. He confesses he is himself not free from blame. For ‘his own kinsfolk and dependants’ lent ‘on usury,’ and he their head and representative was responsible for them. They may have been generous and forbearing, but they had violated the principle, which he was upholding: and in so far, Nehemiah accepted the blame of his house. Some suppose that Nehemiah in lending did not require a pledge, and thus differed from the regular money-lenders. ‘Brethren,’ ‘servants.’ See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-23.htm" title="So neither I, nor my brothers, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes, saving that every one put them off for washing.">Nehemiah 4:23</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>might <span class="ital">exact of them money and corn</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">do lend them money and corn on usury.</span> The rendering of the A.V. ‘might exact’ seems to be dictated by the desire to save the honour of Nehemiah and of his house. But the clause does not claim a privilege, but states a fact. By diplomatically accepting the responsibility of a share in the general guilt, he conciliates his hearers and disarms them of a retort. Nevertheless we gather from the clause that it was not so much ‘usury’ as the abuse of usury, the excessive and tyrannical rate of interest exacted from the poor, which excited his indignation against the rich.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I pray you</span>] These words render a Hebrew particle adding urgency to the request, without introducing the idea of supplication, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm" title="And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:">Nehemiah 1:5</a>. It might be rendered ‘Come now, let us leave off, &c.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">let us leave off this usury</span>] Nehemiah invites his hearers to join with him in abandoning a custom which had been productive of such evil results. ‘This usury,’ i.e. requiring of interest or of pledges.
