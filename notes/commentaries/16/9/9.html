It was reasonable to remember this, now they were interceding for the perfecting of their deliverance out of Babylon. <span class="ital">And showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh — </span>Many and mighty, such as were unprecedented and unparalleled, thereby <span class="ital">getting honour </span>upon him, and upon his servants and people, the deliverance of thy people being the destruction of their enemies. <span class="ital">For thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them — </span>Intending to make them their slaves for ever, as, for the present, they treated them with the utmost contempt and cruelty.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:4-38 The summary of their prayers we have here upon record. Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The host of heaven worshippeth thee - i. e the angels.

Thou, even thou, art Lord alone, &c.&#8212;In this solemn and impressive prayer, in which they make public confession of their sins, and deprecate the judgments due to the transgressions of their fathers, they begin with a profound adoration of God, whose supreme majesty and omnipotence is acknowledged in the creation, preservation, and government of all. Then they proceed to enumerate His mercies and distinguished favors to them as a nation, from the period of the call of their great ancestor and the gracious promise intimated to him in the divinely bestowed name of Abraham, a promise which implied that he was to be the Father of the faithful, the ancestor of the Messiah, and the honored individual in whose seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. Tracing in full and minute detail the signal instances of divine interposition for their deliverance and their interest&#8212;in their deliverance from Egyptian bondage&#8212;their miraculous passage through the Red Sea&#8212;the promulgation of His law&#8212;the forbearance and long-suffering shown them amid their frequent rebellions&#8212;the signal triumphs given them over their enemies&#8212;their happy settlement in the promised land&#8212;and all the extraordinary blessings, both in the form of temporal prosperity and of religious privilege, with which His paternal goodness had favored them above all other people, they charge themselves with making a miserable requital. They confess their numerous and determined acts of disobedience. They read, in the loss of their national independence and their long captivity, the severe punishment of their sins. They acknowledge that, in all heavy and continued judgments upon their nation, God had done right, but they had done wickedly. And in throwing themselves on His mercy, they express their purpose of entering into a national covenant, by which they pledge themselves to dutiful obedience in future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt,....
