Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou gavest them saviours - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm">Judges 3:15</a> etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

There was a continual succession of prophets from the time of Solomon to, and through, the captivity. Besides those whose writings have come down to us, we find mention of Ahijah the Shilonite, Iddo the seer, Shemaiah the prophet, Hanani, Jehu the son of Hanani, Elijah, Elisha, Micaiah the son of Imlah, Zechariah the son of Jehoiada, Huldah, and (perhaps) Hosai.

Aben Ezra and others refer the suffix to the Canaanites, whom God scattered in multos angulos or varias mundi partes. Others refer it to the Israelites. According to this view, Ramb. says: fecisti eos per omnes terrae Cananaeae angulos habitare; and Gusset.: distribuisti eis terram usque ad angulum h. l. nulla vel minima regionum particula excepta. But &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, Piel, generally means the dividing of things; and when used of persons, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-16.htm">Lamentations 4:16</a>, to divide, to scatter, sensu malo, which is here inapplicable to the Israelites. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511; signifies to divide, especially by lot, and is used chiefly concerning the partition of the land of Canaan, in Kal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/14-5.htm">Joshua 14:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-2.htm">Joshua 18:2</a>, and in Piel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-7.htm">Joshua 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-10.htm">Joshua 18:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-51.htm">Joshua 19:51</a>. The word &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492; also frequently occurs in Joshua, in the sense of a corner or side lying towards a certain quarter of the heavens, and of a boundary; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-5.htm">Joshua 15:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-12.htm">Joshua 18:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-14.htm">Joshua 18:14-15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-20.htm">Joshua 18:20</a>. According to this, Bertheau rightly takes the words to say: Thou didst divide them (the kingdoms and nations, i.e., the land of these nations) according to sides or boundaries, i.e., according to certain definite limits. Sihon is the king of Heshbon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>), and the &#1493; before &#1495; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1502; is not to be expunged as a gloss, but regarded as explicative: and, indeed, both the land of the king of Heshbon and the land of Og. The conquest of these two kingdoms is named first, because it preceded the possession of Canaan (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). The increase of the children of the Israelites is next mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-23.htm">Nehemiah 9:23</a>; the fathers having fallen in the wilderness, and only their children coming into the land of Canaan. The numbering of the people in the plains of Moab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/26.htm">Numbers 26</a>) is here alluded to, when the new generation was found to be twice as numerous as that which marched out of Egypt; while the words &#1500;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-15.htm">Nehemiah 9:15</a>, are similar to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-10.htm">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>.
