Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou didst divide them into corners - i. e., parts of the holy land; or as some prefer "thou didst distribute them on all sides." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

The difficulty of rendering arises from the word ‘pêah’ = ‘a corner,’ or ‘edge,’ which the LXX. and Vulg. do not attempt to translate. Used of ‘a corner’ in such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-9.htm" title="And when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not wholly reap the corners of your field, neither shall you gather the gleanings of your harvest.">Leviticus 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-27.htm" title="You shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shall you mar the corners of your beard.">Leviticus 19:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-12.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; As the shepherd takes out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.">Amos 3:12</a>; it is found with a territorial signification, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a> ‘the corners of Moab,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-5.htm" title="And the east border was the salt sea, even to the end of Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:">Joshua 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/18-14.htm" title="And the border was drawn there, and compassed the corner of the sea southward, from the hill that lies before Bethhoron southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this was the west quarter....">Joshua 18:14-15</a>, ‘the north quarter,’ ‘the west quarter,’ ‘the south quarter,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm" title="They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon because of the force: but a fire shall come forth out of Heshbon, and a flame from the middle of Sihon, and shall devour the corner of Moab, and the crown of the head of the tumultuous ones.">Jeremiah 48:45</a> ‘the corner of Moab.’ It does not seem to occur anywhere in a technical sense for ‘a lot’ or ‘an appointed portion.’ ‘To allot according to corner,’ in the sense of ‘after their portions’ (as the R.V.), may give the meaning of the obscure phrase; but no satisfactory parallel to this use of ‘<span class="ital">pêah</span>’ occurs in the O. T. This being the case, it is probable that preference should be given to the R.V. marg. ‘into every corner,’ a translation which renders ‘pêah’ literally, and explains the Hebrew idiom by the insertion of the word ‘every.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Sihon … Og</span>] The victory over these kings at the battles of Jahaz and Edrei is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-21.htm" title="And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,...">Numbers 21:21-35</a>. It made the children of Israel masters of the E. bank of the Jordan. Reference to the conquest of these two kings is frequent, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-33.htm" title="And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country round about.">Numbers 32:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-4.htm" title="After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelled in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelled at Astaroth in Edrei:">Deuteronomy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-10.htm" title="For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red sea for you, when you came out of Egypt; and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.">Joshua 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/135-11.htm" title="Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan:">Psalm 135:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/136-19.htm" title="Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endures for ever:...">Psalm 136:19-20</a>. The territory of the two Amorite kings stretched from the river Jabbok in the S. to the Hauran Mts. in the N., and included the district of Argob.

But Thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not." In these verses the conduct of the children of Israel towards God is contrasted with His kindness towards this stiff-necked people, the historical confirmation following in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>. &#1493;&#1492;&#1501; is emphatic, and prefixed to contrast the conduct of the Israelites with the benefits bestowed on them. The contrast is enhanced by the &#1493; explicative before &#1488;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, even our fathers (which J. D. Michaelis would expunge, from a misconception of its meaning, but which Bertheau with good reason defends). Words are accumulated to describe the stiff-necked resistance of the people. &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; as above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-10.htm">Nehemiah 9:10</a>.

The repetition of the expression, "they hardened their hearts," shows that a second grievous transgression is already spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-17.htm">Nehemiah 9:17</a>. This is made even clearer by the next clause, &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, which is taken almost verbally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> : "They said one to another, Let us make a captain (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;), and return to Egypt;" the notion being merely enhanced here by the addition &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501;, to their bondage. The comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-4.htm">Numbers 14:4</a> also shows that &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is a clerical error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, as the lxx read; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, in their stubbornness, after &#1500;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;&#1514;&#1501;, gives no appropriate sense. In spite, however, of their stiff-neckedness, God of His mercy and goodness did not forsake them. &#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1495;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;, a God of pardons; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-9.htm">Daniel 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-4.htm">Psalm 130:4</a>. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; &#1495;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503; is a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>.
