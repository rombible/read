Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stand up - The people had knelt to confess and to worship God <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-3.htm">Nehemiah 9:3</a>.

Bunni, the second Bani, Chenani disappear; and the names of Hashabneiah, Hodiah, Pethahiah are introduced afresh. The remaining five names are the same in both lists; and this adds to the difficulty in accounting for the variation, for there seems to be no reason for a partial change of <span class="ital">personnel</span> at this juncture. Very possibly the Hebrew text is in fault.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. gives only two names, Jeshua and Kadmiel, but its tendency to shorten lists of names (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm" title="Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people stood in their place.">Nehemiah 8:7</a>) diminishes the value of its testimony in the present instance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The best way of accounting for the variation is to suppose that the compiler turns at this point to a different source of information, in which there was a slight disagreement in the list of names. The compiler transcribes: he neither corrects nor explains; and the variation is evidence both of his candour and of the general honesty of subsequent copyists.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Stand up</span>] It may be questioned whether these words should be understood literally. Some commentators suppose that the Levites enjoin the people to exchange the kneeling position of prayer for the standing posture of praise. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-2.htm" title="And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.">Nehemiah 9:2</a> we are told the people ‘stood and confessed their sins,’ and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-3.htm" title="And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD their God.">Nehemiah 9:3</a> they ‘confessed and worshipped the Lord.’ Now ‘worshipping’ is not necessarily ‘kneeling.’ Prayer and confession are quite consistent with a ‘standing position,’ cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-5.htm" title="And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:">Nehemiah 8:5</a> and note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If not taken literally, it must be understood in its common metaphorical sense ‘arise,’ ‘up!’ prefacing an appeal to the laity to join in praise with the Levites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for ever and ever</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">from everlasting to everlasting.</span> Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.">Psalm 41:13</a>, ‘Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting and to everlasting,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-2.htm" title="Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting, you are God.">Psalm 90:2</a>, ‘even from everlasting to everlasting, thou art God,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-17.htm" title="But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting on them that fear him, and his righteousness to children's children;">Psalm 103:17</a>. The words are connected more appropriately with ‘the Lord your God’ than with the verb ‘bless.’ This ascription to the Eternal Jehovah is possibly taken from a familiar doxology in Jewish worship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-13.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.">Psalm 41:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">blessed be</span>] R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">let them bless</span>’. The rendering ‘let them bless’ is more literal. The third Pers. Plur. will refer either to the Israelites or, by a more comprehensive thought, to the dwellers of the earth. But the change of person is abrupt and not without awkwardness. It is perhaps due to a quotation from a Doxology; compare a somewhat similar clause introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-48.htm" title="Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise you the LORD.">Psalm 106:48</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The LXX. rendering introduces the words ‘and Ezra said’ as a prefix to this clause, as if the whole of the ensuing address were his utterance. No other evidence, however, supports this reading; but it seems to preserve a very probable tradition based on the similarity of this confession to that of Ezra in Ezra 9.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy glorious name</span>] Literally, ‘the name of thy glory’ (<span class="ital">kâbôd</span>) as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-19.htm" title="And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.">Psalm 72:19</a>, ‘blessed be his glorious name for ever.’ The expression differs very slightly from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-13.htm" title="Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.">1 Chronicles 29:13</a>, ‘Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious name’ (lit. the name of thy glory ‘<span class="ital">tiphereth</span>’). The Name is the Being of God made known to man; the glory (<span class="ital">kâbôd</span>) of it is its manifestation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-18.htm" title="And he said, I beseech you, show me your glory.">Exodus 33:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-22.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, while my glory passes by, that I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and will cover you with my hand while I pass by:">Exodus 33:22</a>), of which splendour (<span class="ital">tiphereth</span>) is an accompaniment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">exalted above all blessing and praise</span>] i.e. man can add nothing thereto by the highest blessings or by the noblest praises.

The text only states that since the days of Joshua the whole community had not so celebrated it, i.e., had not dwelt in booths. Neither do the words imply that since the days of Joshua to that time no booths at all had been made at the celebration of the feast of tabernacles, but only that this had not been done by the whole congregation. On former occasions, those who came up to Jerusalem may have regarded this precept as non-essential, and contented themselves by keeping the feast with solemn assemblies, sacrifices, and sacrificial feasts, without making booths and dwelling in them for seven days.</body></html>
