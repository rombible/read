No stranger was to take part in this national act of humiliation and confession. The ‘strangers,’ i.e. the heathen who had not joined themselves to the ‘holy seed,’ and yet resided in Jerusalem, were not permitted to take part in the ceremony about to be described. Some commentators regard the words as describing in anticipation the result of the action taken by the Israelites on this day, as if by their penitence and confession they finally severed themselves from ‘the strangers.’ But from the position of the verse it is more natural to understand it of a solemn act of separation preliminary to the ratification of the Covenant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">from all strangers</span>] ‘<span class="ital">b’ ney nêkar</span>,’ i.e. ‘children of the foreigner,’ LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ παντὸς υἱοῦ ἀλλοτρίου</span>.

This statement is not to be understood as saying that the heads of the people sought in the law, fourteen days before the feast, for information as to what they would have to do, that they might prepare for the due celebration of the feast of tabernacles (Bertheau). The text only states that the heads of the people again betook themselves to Ezra on the second day, to receive from him instruction in the law, and that in reading the law they found the precept concerning the celebration of the festival in booths, i.e., they met with this precept, and were thereby induced to celebrate the approaching festival in strict accordance with its directions. The law concerning the feast of tabernacles, of which the essentials are here communicated, is found <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13</a> they were only commanded to keep the feast with gladness. The particular of dwelling in booths or bowers is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>; the further details in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a> relate to the carrying out of the direction: "He shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees, and willows of the brook" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-43.htm">Leviticus 23:43</a>). Go to the mountain, a woody district, whence branches may be obtained. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, state constructive plural of &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;, leaf, foliage, here leafy boughs or branches of trees. &#1494;&#1497;&#1514;, the olive, &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1503; &#1506;&#1509;, the wild olive (oleaster), the myrtle, the palm, and branches of thick-leaved trees, are here mentioned (the two latter being also named in Leviticus). &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not relate to the preparation of the booths, but to the precept that the feast should be kept in booths. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a> the accomplishment of the matter is related, presupposing a compliance with the proclamation sent out into all the cities in the land, and indeed so speedy a compliance that the booths were finished by the day of the feast. The object (the branches of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-15.htm">Nehemiah 8:15</a>) must be supplied to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; from the context. They made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the open space at the water-gate (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>), and the open space at the gate of Ephraim. On the situation of this gate, see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-8.htm">Nehemiah 3:8</a>. The open space before it must be thought of as within the city walls. On these two public places, booths were probably made by those who had come to Jerusalem, but did not dwell there; while the priests and Levites belonging to other places would build theirs in the courts of the temple.</body></html>
