Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seal unto it - The exact force of the phrase used is doubtful; but its general sense must be that the classes named took part in the sealing.

Chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-1.htm" title="Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,">Nehemiah 10:1</a> in Heb.; so Luther. The A.V. and R.V. follow the division of the Vulg. and LXX.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And because of all this</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">And yet for all this.</span> R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">because of</span>’. The relation of this sentence to the preceding confession is not certain. This uncertainty has given rise to the doubt whether chap. 9 should not have closed at <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-37.htm" title="And it yields much increase to the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.">Nehemiah 9:37</a>. The English translation treats the verse as the concluding sentence of the Confession. The A.V. rendering ‘And because of all this’ refers back to the whole summary of Israelite history (7–37), i.e. ‘because of Jehovah’s mercy in spite of our disobedience.’ The R.V. rendering ‘And yet for all this’ refers especially to the concluding words, describing the sorrows and afflictions which had come upon the people, i.e. ‘And yet in spite of all this oppression our faith in God’s mercy is unshaken, and in proof thereof we sign the covenant.’ This explanation, which is preferable, seems to derive support from other passages where the same prep. and pron. occur. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 5:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-12.htm" title="The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.">Isaiah 9:12</a>, ‘For all this his anger is not turned away.’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-22.htm" title="In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.">Job 1:22</a>, ‘In all this Job sinned not.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The view that the verse resumes the narrative of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/9-1.htm" title="Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloths, and earth on them....">Nehemiah 9:1-5</a> is very improbable on account of the use of the 1st pers. plur., which has not been employed in this section (chaps. 8 and 9).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Massoretic division into chapters, which begins chap. 10 with this verse, severs the connexion with the previous verses. It was perhaps considered that a more considerable break should be introduced between the conclusion of the Confession and the signing of the Covenant. The Massoretes regarded the present verse as Nehemiah’s preface to the new section.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sure</span>] R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">faithful</span>’. The words ‘a sure covenant’ render the Hebrew ‘’emanah,’ which elsewhere in the O. T. is only found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-23.htm" title="For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.">Nehemiah 11:23</a>, ‘a settled provision’ (marg. ‘a sure ordinance’). The regular phrase for ‘making’ (lit. ‘cutting’) a covenant (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-8.htm" title="And found his heart faithful before you, and made a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and have performed your words; for you are righteous:">Nehemiah 9:8</a>) occurs; and there can be no doubt of its meaning here. LXX. <span class="greekheb">διατιθέμεθα πίστιν</span>. Vulg. ‘percutimus foedus.’ The Covenant is not between Ezra and the people, but between the people and Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our princes, Levites</span>, and <span class="ital">priests</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">our princes, our Levites</span>, and <span class="bld">our priests</span>. The position of the Levites between the ‘princes’ and the ‘priests’ deserves notice, as it illustrates the prominence of the Levites in the movement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">seal</span> unto it] R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">are at the sealing</span>’. The A.V. rendering suggests the idea of a seal being affixed by each of the chief representatives. But the meaning is rather that the document having been prepared and rendered official by the addition of the seal, the leaders of the people were ‘upon’ the sealed writing, viz. they either appended signatures as witnesses, or made marks to endorse the document and to testify to their approval. In many of the Assyrian tablets, recording business transactions, the marks of the thumb-nails of the witnesses still attest the fact of their presence and approbation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The National confession (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/9-5.htm" title="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise....">Nehemiah 9:5-38</a></span>) is thus brought to a conclusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-38.htm" title="And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal to it.">Nehemiah 9:38</a> as abruptly as it was begun in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-5.htm" title="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.">Nehemiah 9:5</a>. It consists of four portions, (1) <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-5.htm" title="Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah, Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.">Nehemiah 9:5</a>, the opening ascription; (2) 6–31, the summary of Israel’s religious history; (3) 32–37, the prayer of deprecation and submission; (4) 38, the announcement of the national covenant. This strikingly practical termination of the Confession is very characteristic of the movement headed by Ezra and Nehemiah. Repentance is to take shape in immediate action.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The summary of past history should be compared with that in Psalms 105, 106, 135, 136. It is expressed for the most part in general terms. The only individuals of the chosen people mentioned by name are Abram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-7.htm" title="You are the LORD the God, who did choose Abram, and brought him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gave him the name of Abraham;">Nehemiah 9:7</a>), and Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-14.htm" title="And made known to them your holy sabbath, and commanded them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses your servant:">Nehemiah 9:14</a>); but the events recorded in the Pentateuch which are here alluded to are numerous—(1) the call of Abram from Ur; (2) the change of name to Abraham; (3) the covenant with Abraham; (4) the overthrow of Pharaoh and the crossing of the Red Sea; (5) the pillar of cloud and fire; (6) the giving of the law on Mt Sinai; (7) manna; (8) water from the rock; (9) the golden calf; (10) the defeat of Sihon and Og. The possession of the land (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/9-24.htm" title="So the children went in and possessed the land, and you subdued before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gave them into their hands, with their kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with them as they would....">Nehemiah 9:24-25</a></span>) and the sending of the judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-27.htm" title="Therefore you delivered them into the hand of their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried to you, you heard them from heaven; and according to your manifold mercies you gave them saviors, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.">Nehemiah 9:27</a>) are mentioned, but with much less definiteness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is strange that we have no mention of Joshua, Samuel, David or Solomon. But very probably the reason of the omission is that the contents of the Pentateuch in the age of Nehemiah were alone regarded as sacred Scripture. Reference to subsequent events and later names would not carry the same weight. These would not be so familiar to the people, and would not carry with them the authority of Divine teaching which already belonged to the ‘Law.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Because of all this</span>.
