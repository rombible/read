Much more, no doubt, was said. Whatever ability we have to do any thing in the way of duty, we are to serve and glorify God according to the utmost of it. When confessing our sins, it is good to notice the mercies of God, that we may be the more humbled and ashamed. The dealings of the Lord showed his goodness and long-suffering, and the hardness of their hearts. The testimony of the prophets was the testimony of the Spirit in the prophets, and it was the Spirit of Christ in them. They spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and what they said is to be received accordingly. The result was, wonder at the Lord's mercies, and the feeling that sin had brought them to their present state, from which nothing but unmerited love could rescue them. And is not their conduct a specimen of human nature? Let us study the history of our land, and our own history. Let us recollect our advantages from childhood, and ask what were our first returns? Let us frequently do so, that we may be kept humble, thankful, and watchful. Let all remember that pride and obstinacy are sins which ruin the soul. But it is often as hard to persuade the broken-hearted to hope, as formerly it was to bring them to fear. Is this thy case? Behold this sweet promise, A God ready to pardon! Instead of keeping away from God under a sense of unworthiness, let us come boldly to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. He is a God ready to pardon.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The host of heaven worshippeth thee - i. e the angels.

Thou, even thou, art Lord alone, &c.&#8212;In this solemn and impressive prayer, in which they make public confession of their sins, and deprecate the judgments due to the transgressions of their fathers, they begin with a profound adoration of God, whose supreme majesty and omnipotence is acknowledged in the creation, preservation, and government of all. Then they proceed to enumerate His mercies and distinguished favors to them as a nation, from the period of the call of their great ancestor and the gracious promise intimated to him in the divinely bestowed name of Abraham, a promise which implied that he was to be the Father of the faithful, the ancestor of the Messiah, and the honored individual in whose seed all the families of the earth should be blessed.

They confess their numerous and determined acts of disobedience. They read, in the loss of their national independence and their long captivity, the severe punishment of their sins. They acknowledge that, in all heavy and continued judgments upon their nation, God had done right, but they had done wickedly. And in throwing themselves on His mercy, they express their purpose of entering into a national covenant, by which they pledge themselves to dutiful obedience in future.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Didst choose Abram</span> out of the midst of all his nation and family.

The selection of the ‘chosen people’ was the free act of God’s love. This thought lay at the root of the covenant relation between Him and Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-37.htm" title="And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>, ‘and because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-7.htm" title="Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.

According to some scholars, ‘Ur of the Chaldees’ is to be found in S. Babylonia, on the right bank of the Euphrates, and to be identified either with Warka (= Erech, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>) or Mugheir = Uru, one of the oldest Babylonian cities. According to others, it was situate in Northern Assyria, with which would agree the descent of Terah from Aram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-23.htm" title="And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.">Genesis 10:23</a>) and the home of Abraham’s kinsfolk being Padan-Aram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-20.htm" title="And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to Laban the Syrian.">Genesis 25:20</a>). The latter view is perhaps most favoured by Israelite tradition, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-5.htm" title="And you shall speak and say before the LORD your God, A Syrian ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, and populous:">Deuteronomy 26:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-9.htm" title="You whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called you from the chief men thereof, and said to you, You are my servant; I have chosen you, and not cast you away.">Isaiah 41:9</a>. It was Terah who moved from Ur of the Chaldees to Haran; but Jewish tradition always regarded this as the expression of a Divine call to Abraham. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-4.htm" title="Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelled in Charran: and from there, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein you now dwell.">Acts 7:4</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31</a>. The Vulgate ‘de igne Chaldaeorum’ treats ‘Ur’ as if it were the Hebrew word (spelt with the same consonants) meaning ‘light.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the name of Abraham</span>] The change of the patriarch’s name from Abram to Abraham is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-5.htm" title="Neither shall your name any more be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made you.">Genesis 17:5</a>, to which the reference is probably made. That Abram means ‘lofty father’ and Abraham ‘the father of a multitude’ is probably only an instance of popular Israelite etymology. ‘Abu-ra-mu’ is found as the proper name of a man in Assyrian inscriptions; and the change from the shorter to the longer form, is perhaps a return to an older and more venerated form of the name. The precise meaning of the name is of slight moment. The important point to notice is, that the change of name corresponds with the institution of the covenant sign of circumcision. The change of the name was a pledge of the new relation, into which Abraham and his seed passed; cf. ‘Jacob’ and ‘Israel’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm" title="And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.">Genesis 35:10</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/9.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 7-31.</span> - Compare with this long historical <span class="accented">resume</span> the still longer ones in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-5.htm">Psalm 78:5-72</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2-47</a>. God's dealings with his people furnished a moral lesson of extraordinary force, and moral teachers, naturally, made frequent reference to them. But it is not often that we have so complete and elaborate a recapitulation as the present, which, beginning with the call of Abraham, brings the history down to the time of the Persian servitude. God's goodness and his people's ingratitude form the burthen of the whole. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the twenty-second of Tishri was the Hazereth of the feast of tabernacles; on the twenty-fourth the congregation re-assembled in the temple, "with fasting and with sackcloths (penitential garments made of hair; see rem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>) and earth upon them," i.e., spread upon their heads (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>), - the external marks of deep mourning and heaviness of heart.</body></html>
