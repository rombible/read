Samaritans, wild Arabs of the desert, Ammonites, and inhabitants of Ashdod in the Philistine plain would have been brought together for no noble work, but mischief and malice fused them for a time into one. God’s work is attacked from all sides. Herod and Pilate can shake hands over their joint antagonism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This passage paints vividly the discouragements which are apt to dog all good work, and the courage which refuses to be discouraged, and conquers by bold persistence. The first verse {<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-9.htm" title="Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.">Nehemiah 4:9</a>} may stand as a summary of the whole, though it refers to the preceding, not to the following, verses. The true way to meet opposition is twofold-prayer and prudent watchfulness. ‘Pray to God, and keep your powder dry,’ is not a bad compendium of the duty of a Christian soldier. The union of appeal to God with the full use of common sense, watchfulness, and prudence, would dissipate many hindrances to successful service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">I.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-10.htm" title="And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.">Nehemiah 4:10</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelled by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where you shall return to us they will be on you.">Nehemiah 4:12</a> Nehemiah tells, in his simple way, of the difficulties from three several quarters which threatened to stop his work. He had trouble from the workmen, from the enemies, and from the mass of Jews not resident in Jerusalem. The enthusiasm of the builders had cooled, and the magnitude of their task began to frighten them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-6.htm" title="So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together to the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.">Nehemiah 4:6</a> tells us that the wall was completed ‘unto the half of it’; that is, to one-half the height, and half-way through is just the critical time in all protracted work. The fervour of beginning has passed; the animation from seeing the end at hand has not sprung up. There is a dreary stretch in the centre, where it takes much faith and self-command to plod on unfainting. Half-way to Australia from England is the region of sickening calms. It is easier to work in the fresh morning or in the cool evening than at midday. So in every great movement there are short-winded people who sit down and pant very soon, and their prudence croaks out undeniable facts. No doubt strength does become exhausted; no doubt there is ‘much rubbish’ {literally ‘dust’}. What then? The conclusion drawn is not so unquestionable as the premises. ‘We cannot build the wall’ Why not? Have you not built half of it? And was not the first half more embarrassed by rubbish than the second will be?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is a great piece of Christian duty to recognise difficulties, and not be cowed by them. The true inference from the facts would have been, ‘so that we must put all our strength into the work, and trust in our God to help us.’ We may not be responsible for discouragements suggesting themselves, but we are responsible for letting them become dissuasives. Our one question should be, Has God appointed the work? If so, it has to be done, however little our strength, and however mountainous the accumulations of rubbish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second part in the trio was taken by the enemies-Sanballat and Tobiah and the rest. They laid their plans for a sudden swoop down on Jerusalem, and calculated that, if they could surprise the builders at their work, they would have no weapons to show fight with, and so would be easily despatched. Killing the builders was but a means; the desired end is significantly put last {<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-11.htm" title="And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come in the middle among them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.">Nehemiah 4:11</a>}, as being the stopping of the abhorred work. But killing the workmen does not cause the work to cease when it is God’s work, as the history of the Church in all ages shows. Conspirators should hold their tongues. It was not a hopeful way of beginning an attack, of which the essence was secrecy and suddenness, to talk about it. ‘A bird of the air carries the matter.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The third voice is that of the Jews in other parts of the land, and especially those living on the borders of Samaria, next door to Sanballat. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-12.htm" title="And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelled by them came, they said to us ten times, From all places from where you shall return to us they will be on you.">Nehemiah 4:12</a> is probably best taken as in the Revised Version, which makes ‘Ye must return to us’ the imperative and often-repeated summons from these to the contingents from their respective places of abode, who had gone up to Jerusalem to help in building. Alarms of invasion made the scattered villagers wish to have all their men capable of bearing arms back again to defend their own homes. It was a most natural demand, but in this case, as so often, audacity is truest prudence; and in all high causes there come times when men have to trust their homes and dear ones to God’s protection. The necessity is heartrending, and we may well pray that we may not be exposed to it; but if it clearly arises, a devout man can have no doubt of his duty. How many American citizens had to face it in the great Civil War! And how character is ennobled by even so severe a sacrifice!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">II. </span>The calm heroism of Nehemiah and his wise action in the emergency are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-13.htm" title="Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on the higher places, I even set the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.">Nehemiah 4:13</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-15.htm" title="And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had brought their counsel to nothing, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one to his work.">Nehemiah 4:15</a>. He made a demonstration in force, which at once showed that the scheme of a surprise was blown to pieces. It is difficult to make out the exact localities in which he planted his men. ‘The lower places behind the wall’ probably means the points at which the new fortifications were lowest, which would be the most exposed to assault; and the ‘higher places’ {Auth. Ver.}, or ‘open places’ {Rev. Ver.}, describes the same places from another point of view. They afforded room for posting troops because they were without buildings. At any rate, the walls were manned, and the enemy would have to deal, not with unarmed labourers, but with prepared soldiers. The work was stopped, and trowel and spade exchanged for sword and spear. ‘And I looked,’ says Nehemiah. His careful eye travelled over the lines, and, seeing all in order, he cheered the little army with ringing words. He had prayed {<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-5.htm" title="And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:">Nehemiah 1:5</a>} to ‘the great and terrible God,’ and now he bids his men remember Him, and thence draw strength and courage. The only real antagonist of fear is faith. If we can grasp God, we shall not dread Sanballat and his crew. Unless we do, the world is full of dangers which it is not folly to fear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note, too, that the people are animated for the fight by reminding them of the dear ones whose lives and honour hung on the issue. Nothing is said about fighting for God and His Temple and city, but the motives adduced are not less sacred. Family love is God’s best of earthly gifts, and, though it is sometimes duty to ‘forget thine own people, and thy father’s house,’ as we have just seen, nothing short of these highest obligations can supersede the sweet one of straining every nerve for the well-being of dear ones in the hallowed circle of home.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So the plan of a sudden rush came to nothing. It does not appear that the enemy was in sight; but the news of the demonstration soon reached them, and was effectual. Prompt preparation against possible dangers is often the means of turning them aside. Watchfulness is indispensable to vigour of Christian character and efficiency of work. Suspicion is hateful and weakening; but a man who tries to serve God in such a world as this had need to be like the living creatures in the Revelation, having ‘eyes all over.’ ‘Blessed is the man that [in that sense] feareth always.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The upshot of the alarm is very beautifully told: ‘We returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.’ No time was wasted in jubilation. The work was the main thing, and the moment the interruption was ended, back to it they all went. It is a fine illustration of persistent discharge of duty, and of that most valuable quality, the ability and inclination to keep up the main purpose of a life continuous through interruptions, like a stream of sweet water running through a bog.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">III. </span>The remainder of the passage tells us of the standing arrangements made in consequence of the alarm {<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-16.htm" title="And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my servants worked in the work, and the other half of them held both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.">Nehemiah 4:16</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-21.htm" title="So we labored in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.">Nehemiah 4:21</a>}. First we hear what Nehemiah did with his own special ‘servants,’ whether these were slaves who had accompanied him from Shushan {as Stanley supposes}, or his body-guard as a Persian official. He divided them into two parts-one to work, one to watch. But he did not carry out this plan with the mass of the people, probably because it would have too largely diminished the number of builders. So he armed them all. The labourers who carried stones, mortar, and the like, could do their work after a fashion with one hand, and so they had a weapon in the other. If they worked in pairs, that would be all the easier. The actual builders needed both hands, and so they had swords stuck in their girdles. No doubt such arrangements hindered progress, but they were necessary. The lesson often drawn from them is no doubt true, that God’s workers must be prepared for warfare as well as building. There have been epochs in which that necessity was realised in a very sad manner; and the Church on earth will always have to be the Church militant. But it is well to remember that building is the end, and fighting is but the means. The trowel, not the sword, is the natural instrument. Controversy is second best-a necessity, no doubt, but an unwelcome one, and only permissible as a subsidiary help to doing the true work, rearing the walls of the city of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘He that soundeth the trumpet was by me.’ The gallant leader was everywhere, animating by his presence. He meant to be in the thick of the fight, if it should come. And so he kept the trumpeter by his side, and gave orders that when he sounded all should hurry to the place; for there the enemy would be, and Nehemiah would be where they were. ‘The work is great and large, and we are separated . . . one far from another.’ How naturally the words lend themselves to the old lesson so often drawn from them! God’s servants are widely parted, by distance, by time, and, alas! by less justifiable causes. Unless they draw together they will be overwhelmed, taken in detail, and crushed. They must rally to help each other against the common foe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thank God! the longing for manifest Christian unity is deeper to-day than ever it was. But much remains to be done before it is adequately fulfilled in the recognition of the common bond of brotherhood, which binds us all in one family, if we have one Father. English and American Christians are bound to seek the tightening of the bonds between them and to set themselves against politicians who may seek to keep apart those who both in the flesh and in the spirit are brothers. All Christians have one great Captain; and He will be in the forefront of every battle. His clear trumpet-call should gather all His servants to His side.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The closing verse tells again how Nehemiah’s immediate dependants divided work and watching, and adds to the picture the continuousness of their toil from the first grey of morning till darkness showed the stars and ended another day of toil. Happy they who thus ‘from morn till noon, from noon till dewy eve,’ labour in the work of the Lord! For them, every new morning will dawn with new strength, and every evening be calm with the consciousness of ‘something attempted, something done.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/nehemiah/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-9.htm" title="Nevertheless we made our prayer to our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.">Nehemiah 4:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">We made our prayer unto God — </span>They committed themselves to the protection of God, whose servants they were, and whom they considered as being engaged for them.

God has many ways of bringing to light, and so of bringing to nought, the devices and designs of his church's enemies. If our enemies cannot frighten us from duty, or deceive us into sin, they cannot hurt us. Nehemiah put himself and his cause under the Divine protection. It was the way of this good man, and should be our way. All his cares, all his griefs, all his fears, he spread before God. Before he used any means, he made his prayer to God. Having prayed, he set a watch against the enemy. If we think to secure ourselves by prayer, without watchfulness, we are slothful, and tempt God; if by watchfulness, without prayer, we are proud, and slight God: either way, we forfeit his protection. God's care of our safety, should engage and encourage us to go on with vigour in our duty. As soon as a danger is over, let us return to our work, and trust God another time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because of them - Or, "over against them," i. e. opposite to the place where they were encamped, probably on the north side of the city. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 4:7-23. He Sets a Watch.<p>7-21. But &#8230; when Sanballat &#8230; heard that the walls &#8230; were made up, and &#8230; the breaches &#8230; stopped&#8212;The rapid progress of the fortifications, despite all their predictions to the contrary, goaded the Samaritans to frenzy. So they, dreading danger from the growing greatness of the Jews, formed a conspiracy to surprise them, demolish their works, and disperse or intimidate the builders. The plot being discovered, Nehemiah adopted the most energetic measures for ensuring the common safety, as well as the uninterrupted building of the walls. Hitherto the governor, for the sake of despatch, had set all his attendants and guards on the work&#8212;now half of them were withdrawn to be constantly in arms. The workmen labored with a trowel in one hand and a sword in the other; and as, in so large a circuit, they were far removed from each other, Nehemiah (who was night and day on the spot, and, by his pious exhortations and example, animated the minds of his people) kept a trumpeter by his side, so that, on any intelligence of a surprise being brought to him, an alarm might be immediately sounded, and assistance rendered to the most distant detachment of their brethren. By these vigilant precautions, the counsels of the enemy were defeated, and the work was carried on apace. God, when He has important public work to do, never fails to raise up instruments for accomplishing it, and in the person of Nehemiah, who, to great natural acuteness and energy added fervent piety and heroic devotion, He provided a leader, whose high qualities fitted him for the demands of the crisis. Nehemiah's vigilance anticipated every difficulty, his prudent measures defeated every obstruction, and with astonishing rapidity this Jerusalem was made again "a city fortified."   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/nehemiah/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, we made our prayer unto our God,....

Nehemiah mentions the spiritual source of aid first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and set a watch</span>] i.e. posted sentinels. The human means of defence are not neglected although the confidence rests in a higher protection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">day and night</span>] i.e. while the builders were at work on the wall, the city was almost as defenceless against a surprise as in the dead of night.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">against them … because of them</span>] ‘against them,’ i.e. ‘to repel their attack:’ ‘because of them,’ literally ‘from before their face,’ i.e. in consequence of their hostility and the fear which they had excited. Others render ‘over against’, i.e. so as to watch and observe the movements of the foe. The rendering ‘over against’ introduces the idea of a definite mustering of defenders upon some particular quarter of the city, and some have suggested that the reference is to the north side as the most open for assault and nearest to the Samaritan forces. This gives too precise and limited a meaning. The character of the verse is indefinite and general. The recourse to prayer is mentioned in the first clause, and the posting of sentinels in the second. In both cases the action is due to the movement of the enemy, ‘because of them.’ After the words ‘against them’ it seems at first sight a weak conclusion to the sentence. But the words ‘against them’ belong to ‘set a watch’ and are the antithesis to ‘unto our God.’ The words ‘because of them’ refer to both clauses of the <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/4-10.htm" title="And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall....">Nehemiah 4:10-12</a>.
