Those who disagree in almost every thing, will unite in persecution. Nehemiah did not answer these fools according to their folly, but looked up to God by prayer. God's people have often been a despised people, but he hears all the slights that are put upon them, and it is their comfort that he does so. Nehemiah had reason to think that the hearts of those sinners were desperately hardened, else he would not have prayed that their sins might never be blotted out. Good work goes on well, when people have a mind to it.

Their opposition was confined at first to scoffs and insults, in heaping which the governors made themselves conspicuous, and circulated all sorts of disparaging reflections that might increase the feelings of hatred and contempt for them in their own party. The weakness of the Jews in respect of wealth and numbers, the absurdity of their purpose apparently to reconstruct the walls and celebrate the feast of dedication in one day, the idea of raising the walls on their old foundations, as well as using the charred and mouldering debris of the ruins as the materials for the restored buildings, and the hope of such a parapet as they could raise being capable of serving as a fortress of defense&#8212;these all afforded fertile subjects of hostile ridicule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/nehemiah/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Before his brethren; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-3.htm" title="Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down their stone wall.">Nehemiah 4:3</a></span>, and <span class="ital">Geshem</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-19.htm" title="But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that you do? will you rebel against the king?">Nehemiah 2:19</a></span>, and others, whom he calls <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">his brethren, </span> because of their conjunction with him in office and interest. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The army of Samaria; </span> whom he designed hereby to incense against them, or at least to understand their minds herein. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Will they make an end in a day?</span> do they intend to begin and finish the work, and keep the feast of dedication by sacrifice, all in one day? for if they spend any long time about it, they cannot think that we, and the rest of their neighbours, will suffer them to do it.

The Samaritans seem to have hastily summoned their forces to consider whether it would be practicable to compel the Jews by a sudden onslaught to desist from an undertaking so menacing to Samaritan independence. ‘The army’ therefore is not equivalent to ‘an assembly (Vulg. <span class="ital">frequentia</span>),’ but to the population trained in war and capable of bearing arms, collected in face of a sudden emergency. Some have supposed that a body of regular Persian troops stationed at Samaria under a Governor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-7.htm" title="Moreover I said to the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that they may convey me over till I come into Judah;">Nehemiah 2:7</a>) is intended.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">What do</span> these <span class="ital">feeble Jews?</span>] The word rendered ‘feeble’ only occurs here in the O.T. It denotes the languor of weakness. It is akin to a word found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-5.htm" title="They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren has born seven; and she that has many children is waxed feeble.">1 Samuel 2:5</a>, ‘And she that hath many children <span class="ital">languisheth</span>’ (A.V. ‘is waxed feeble’).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will they fortify themselves?</span>] so R.V. text. R.V. marg. ‘Or, <span class="ital">will they leave to themselves</span> aught? Or, <span class="ital">will men let them alone?</span>’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This short interrogative clause has occasioned much difficulty, on account of the word rendered ‘fortify,’ the natural rendering of which (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-8.htm" title="Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next to him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem to the broad wall.">Nehemiah 3:8</a>, where see note) would be ‘leave.’ The versions, LXX. <span class="greekheb">ὄτι οἱ Ἰουδαῖοι οὗτοι οἰκοδομοῦσι τὴν ἑαυτῶν πόλιν</span>, Vulg. <span class="ital">Numbers dimittent eos gentes</span>, fail to throw any light upon the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">a</span>) The rendering of the English versions gives a clear and intelligible meaning. But (1) the use of the word in the sense of ‘fortify’ belongs to late Hebrew and is very rare: (2) in Biblical Hebrew it can only be supported by the uncertain testimony of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-8.htm" title="Next to him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the goldsmiths. Next to him also repaired Hananiah the son of one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem to the broad wall.">Nehemiah 3:8</a> : (3) there is no mockery in such a question, corresponding to the tone of the other queries.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) ‘will they leave to themselves aught?’ This rendering which preserves the usual meaning of the disputed word, is open to the two very strong objections that, (1) the point of the question is conveyed by a word which is not found in the text, i.e. ‘aught,’ (2) the full meaning, obtained from this rendering (i.e. ‘do they expect to survive such an attempt? the Persian Empire will extirpate a people of such presumption; and nothing will be left to them’), is read into the words rather than derived from them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">c</span>) ‘will men let them alone?’ i.e. will the Persian Government or the neighbouring races permit the Jews to carry out their design? Against this rendering, which gives a very intelligible meaning, it must be urged, that (1) it necessitates an awkward change of subject introducing a new subject between two clauses in which ‘the Jews’ are the subject, (2) it treats the Jewish project with serious indignation instead of with the contempt expressed in the other queries.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">d</span>) ‘will they commit themselves unto them?’ i.e. will the Jews entrust themselves and so great a work to their leaders? But we should expect a greater definiteness of expression in a short scornful question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">e</span>) ‘will they on their own behalf (lit. for themselves) commit themselves (i.e. unto God)?’ According to this rendering Sanballat is quoting a cant Jewish phrase ‘to commit oneself,’ leaving his hearers to understand its special application. This use of the word may be illustrated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-14.htm" title="You have seen it; for you behold mischief and spite, to requite it with your hand: the poor commits himself to you; you are the helper of the fatherless.">Psalm 10:14</a>, ‘the helpless committeth (lit. <span class="ital">leaveth</span>) himself unto thee.’ The mockery of such a question is quite in harmony with the general tone of Sanballat’s question.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">f</span>) But it is more probable that the great obscurity of the words arises from an early error in the text, a scribe omitting two syllables very similar to those which followed, and writing ‘lâhem’ = ‘to them’ for ‘lêlôheyhem’ = ‘to their God.’ The sense then would be, ‘Will they commit themselves to their God?’ The same textual error occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-13.htm" title="For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for the iniquity which he knows; because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.">1 Samuel 3:13</a> (see R.V. <span class="ital">marg.</span>). It may then be compared with Rabshakeh’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-30.htm" title="Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The LORD will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.">2 Kings 18:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-32.htm" title="Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, a land of oil olive and of honey, that you may live, and not die: and listen not to Hezekiah, when he persuades you, saying, The LORD will deliver us.">2 Kings 18:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-35.htm" title="Who are they among all the gods of the countries, that have delivered their country out of my hand, that the LORD should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?">2 Kings 18:35</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will they sacrifice?</span>] A mocking question; equivalent to ‘do the Jews imagine that they have only to collect together and propitiate their God with sacrifices, and their work will be done?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will they make an end in a day?</span>] Is it to be all done so simply and so quickly? ‘In a day’ might be rendered ‘in the day,’ as if they said, ‘will they make a beginning and an end in this day?’ (LXX. <span class="greekheb">σήμερον</span>, Vulg. in una die).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">will they revive …?</span>] Are they going to work miracles? The LXX. renders ‘will they heal?’ (<span class="greekheb">ἰάσονται</span>). Cf. ‘the repairing’ (R.V.) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-7.htm" title="But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,">Nehemiah 4:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">of the heaps of the rubbish which are burnt</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</span> The word ‘burned’ refers to ‘the stones.’ Compare on the accumulation of rubbish Sir C. Warren’s statements respecting the excavations at Jerusalem, e.g. in his paper ‘The site of the Temple of the Jews’ (<span class="ital">Trans. Bibl. Arch</span>. vol. vii. p. 320), ‘We … found that the old wall exists to the enormous depth of 125 feet below the rubbish, with stones of very great size.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Before his brethren</span>. By "his brethren" would seem to be meant his chief counsellors - probably Tobiah among them<span class="cmt_word">. The army of Samaria</span>. Some understand by this a Persian garrison, stationed in Samaria under its own commander, with which Sanballat had influence (Ewald, 'History of Israel,' vol. 5. p. 153), but there is no real ground for such a supposition. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83.htm">Psalm 83</a>, belongs probably to David's time; and as Samaria had doubtless its own native force of armed citizens, who were Sanballat's subjects, it is quite unnecessary to suppose that he addressed himself to any other "army" than this. The Persians would maintain a force in Damascus, but scarcely in Samaria; and Persian soldiers, had there been any in that city, would have been more likely to support a royal cupbearer than a petty governor with no influence at court. We can really only explain the disturbed state of things and approach to open hostility which appears in Nehemiah's narrative, by the weakness of Persia in these parts, and the consequent power of the native races to act pretty much as they pleased - even to the extent of making war one upon another<span class="cmt_word">. Will they fortify themselves?</span> No other rendering is tenable. Ewald ('History of Israel,' vol. 3. p. 154, note 5)defends it successfully<span class="cmt_word">. Will they sacrifice? Will they make an end in a day?</span> The meaning seems to be, "Will they begin and make an end in a day?" It is assumed that they will begin by offering a sacrifice to inaugurate their work. <span class="cmt_word">Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are burned?</span> Rather, "Will they revive the burnt stones (the stones that are burned) out of the heaps of the rubbish?" Will they do what is im-possible-solidify and make into real stone the calcined and crumbling blocks which are all that they will find in the heaps of rubbish? If not, how are they to procure material? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The wall of Ophel and the eastern side of the temple area. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-28.htm">Nehemiah 3:28</a> Above the horse-gate repaired the priests, each opposite his own house. The site of the horse-gate appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-15.htm">2 Chronicles 23:15</a> compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-6.htm">2 Kings 11:6</a>, to have been not far distant from the temple and the royal palace; while according to the present verse, compared with <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-27.htm">Nehemiah 3:27</a>, it stood in the neighbourhood of the wall of Ophel, and might well be regarded as even belonging to it. Hence we have, with Thenius, to seek it in the wall running over the Tyropoean valley, and uniting the eastern edge of Zion with the western edge of Ophel in the position of the present dung-gate (Bab el Mogharibeh). This accords with <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-40.htm">Jeremiah 31:40</a>, where it is also mentioned; and from which passage Bertheau infers that it stood at the western side of the valley of Kidron, below the east corner of the temple area. The particular &#1502;&#1506;&#1500;, "from over," that is, above, is not to be understood of a point northwards of the horse-gate, but denotes the place where the wall, passing up from Zion to Ophel, ascended the side of Ophel east of the horse-gate. If, then, the priests here repaired each opposite his house, it is evident that a row of priests' dwellings were built on the western side of Ophel, south of the south-western extremity of the temple area.</body></html>
