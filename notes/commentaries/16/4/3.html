Those who disagree in almost every thing, will unite in persecution. Nehemiah did not answer these fools according to their folly, but looked up to God by prayer. God's people have often been a despised people, but he hears all the slights that are put upon them, and it is their comfort that he does so. Nehemiah had reason to think that the hearts of those sinners were desperately hardened, else he would not have prayed that their sins might never be blotted out. Good work goes on well, when people have a mind to it. The reproaches of enemies should quicken us to our duty, not drive us from it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The gate Miphkad - Not elsewhere mentioned.

The light tread of some creeping animal was enough to bring down their weak wall stone though it was. The ‘<span class="ital">shuâl</span>’ or fox is elsewhere mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/15-4.htm" title="And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in the middle between two tails.">Jdg 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-10.htm" title="They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for foxes.">Psalm 63:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-4.htm" title="O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.">Ezekiel 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-18.htm" title="Because of the mountain of Zion, which is desolate, the foxes walk on it.">Lamentations 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-15.htm" title="Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.">Song of Solomon 2:15</a>. In the passages from Ps., Ez., Lam., it is spoken of in connexion with ruined places. The R.V. margin gives the alternative, ‘jackal’ in each case, except in Ezek. and Cant., where the slyness of the animal (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.">Luke 13:32</a>) shows that the fox is clearly intended. The Hebrew language probably does not distinguish between the ‘jackal’ and the ‘fox.’ Perhaps the allusion in Canticles to the depredations committed by foxes in a vineyard throws light upon Tobiah’s sneer. A fox, he seems to say, would have as little difficulty in breaking through the wall of Jerusalem as through a vineyard fence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">break down</span>] Vulg. <span class="ital">transiliet</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Tobiah the Ammonite was by him</span>. The presence of Tobiah on this occasion, before the alliance was made with the Ammonites (ver. 8), is a strong indication that his position was not one of independent authority, but of dependence upon Sanballat. There is nothing to show that he was more than a favourite slave of the Samaritan governor. <span class="cmt_word">A fox</span>. Or, "a jackal," which would be more likely than a fox to stray over a ruined wall into a town. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Zadok ben Immer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-37.htm">Ezra 2:37</a>) was probably the head of the priestly order of Immer. Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate, can hardly be the same as the Shemaiah of the sons of Shecaniah entered among the descendants of David in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-22.htm">1 Chronicles 3:22</a>. He might rather be regarded as a descendant of the Shemaiah of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/26-6.htm">1 Chronicles 26:6</a>., if the latter had not been enumerated among the sons of Obed-Edom, whose duty was to guard the south side of the temple. The east gate is undoubtedly the east gate of the temple, and not to be identified, as by Bertheau, with the water-gate towards the east (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-26.htm">Nehemiah 3:26</a>). The place where Shemaiah repaired is not more precisely defined; nor can we infer, with Bertheau, from the circumstance of his being the keeper of the east gate, that he, together with his subordinate keepers, laboured at the fortification of this gate and its adjoining section of wall. Such a view is opposed to the order of the description, which passes on to a portion of the wall of Ophel; see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-31.htm">Nehemiah 3:31</a>.</body></html>
