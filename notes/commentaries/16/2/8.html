We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king's forest - Rather, park.

The forest or park from which the timber was to be supplied has been identified by some with the forests of Lebanon, by others with the well-wooded ‘plain’ abounding in olives and sycomores (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-28.htm" title="And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the cellars of oil was Joash:">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>) near the coast. In the present day scholars incline to identify it with ‘Solomon’s Garden’ at Etan or Etam, described by Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant.</span> VIII. 7.3) as richly wooded and well watered (<span class="greekheb">παραδείσοις</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ναμάτων ἐπιρροαῖς ἐπιτερπὲς ὁμοῦ καὶ πλούσιον</span>) distant about six or seven miles S. from Jerusalem. The ‘pleasure-grounds’ of Solomon may have been handed down as ‘royal domains.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In a scantily-wooded country like Palestine a well-preserved forest would have constituted a valuable piece of property.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The management of the ‘timber’ was committed to a royal officer, ‘the keeper of the king’s forest’ or ‘park.’ The name Asaph suggests that ‘the keeper’ was a Jew, which would favour the view of the forest being not far from Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘forest,’ ‘park’ or ‘pleasure-garden.’ The Hebrew word “pardês” (Gr. <span class="greekheb">παράδεισος</span> = English ‘paradise’) is found in the O.T. only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm" title="Your plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; camphire, with spikenard,">Song of Solomon 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm" title="I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of all kind of fruits:">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>. It is said to be of Persian (= Zend <span class="ital">pairidaéza</span>) origin, signifying an ‘enclosure.’ It seems to have been used especially of ‘the royal parks’ or ‘enclosed hunting-grounds’ of the Persian kings, and in this sense to have been received into Hebrew and Greek literature. It occurs with the meaning of a ‘garden’ in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/24-30.htm" title="I also came out as a brook from a river, and as a conduit into a garden.">Sir 24:30</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/40-17.htm" title="Bountifulness is as a most fruitful garden, and mercifulness endureth for ever.">Sir 40:17</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/40-27.htm" title="The fear of the Lord is a fruitful garden, and covereth him above all glory.">Sir 40:27</a>, Susann. <span class="ital">passim</span>.

The old interpretation which explained it to mean the Temple gives no satisfactory meaning to the words ‘that I shall enter into.’ Nehemiah was not a priest; and had no right to enter the Temple (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-11.htm" title="And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his life?

Patrick supposes the forest on Mount Lebanon to be intended; but Nehemiah would scarcely have desired to transport timber for ordinary building purposes from such a distance. Moreover, the word used is one not applicable to a natural forest, but only to a park, or pleasure-ground planted with trees, and surrounded by a fence or wall. The word is <span class="accented">pardes</span>, the Hebrew representative of that Persian term which the Greeks rendered by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, whence our "paradise." We must understand a royal park in the vicinity of Jerusalem, of which a Jew, Asaph, was the keeper. <span class="cmt_word">The palace which appertained to the house</span>. The "house" here spoken of is undoubtedly the temple; and the <span class="accented">birah</span>, appertaining to it is, almost certainly, the fortress at the north-west angle of the temple area, which at once commanded and protected it. Josephus says ('Ant. Jud.,' 15:11, &sect; 4) that this fortress was called <span class="greek">&#x392;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> originally. In Roman times it was known as the "Turris Antonia." <span class="cmt_word">The house that I shall enter into</span>. The governor's residence. Nehemiah assumes that the powers for which he asks involve his being appointed governor of Judaea. The king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me. Through God's special favour towards me, the king was induced to grant my request. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> CHAPTER 2:9-11 NEHEMIAH'S JOURNEY TO JERUSALEM (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-9.htm">Nehemiah 3:9-11</a>). On his way to Jerusalem, Nehemiah would pass through the provinces of various Persian satraps and governors. To those beyond the Euphrates he carried letters, which he took care to deliver, though by doing so he aroused the hostility of San-ballat. Being accompanied by an escort of Persian soldiers, he experienced neither difficulty nor danger by the way, but effected his journey in about three months. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, when wine was before him, Nehemiah as cupbearer took the wine and handed it to the king. Nisan is, according to the Hebrew calendar, the first month of the year; yet here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1-11</a>, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes is named, and the month Chisleu there mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm">Nehemiah 1:1</a>), which, after the Hebrew method of computing the year, was the ninth month and preceded Nisan by three months, is placed in the same year. This can only be explained on the grounds that either the twentieth year of Artaxerxes did not coincide with the year of the calendar, but began later, or that Nehemiah here uses the computation of time current in anterior Asia, and also among the Jews after the captivity in civil matters, and which made the new year begin in autumn. Of these two views we esteem the latter to be correct, since it cannot be shown that the years of the king's reign would be reckoned from the day of his accession. In chronological statements they were reckoned according to the years of the calendar, so that the commencement of a year of a reign coincided with that of the civil year. If, moreover, the beginning of the year is placed in autumn, Tishri is the first, Chisleu the third, and Nisan the seventh month. The circumstances which induced Nehemiah not to apply to the king till three months after his reception of the tidings which so distressed him, are not stated. It is probable that he himself required some time for deliberation before he could come to a decision as to the best means of remedying the distresses of Jerusalem; then, too, he may not have ventured at once to bring his request before the king from fear of meeting with a refusal, and may therefore have waited till an opportunity favourable to his desires should present itself. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1493; &#1497;&#1497;&#1503;, "wine was before the king," is a circumstantial clause explanatory of what follows. The words allude to some banquet at which the king and queen were present. The last sentence, "And I have not been sad before him" (&#1512;&#1506; according to &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; of <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm">Nehemiah 2:2</a>, of a sad countenance), can neither mean, I had never before been sad before him (de Wette); nor, I was accustomed not to be sad before him; but, I had not been sad before him at the moment of presenting the cup to him (Bertheau), because it would not have been becoming to serve the king with a sad demeanour: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-2.htm">Esther 4:2</a>. The king, however, noticed his sadness, and inquired: "Why is thy countenance sad, since thou art not sick? this is nothing but sorrow of heart, i.e., thy sadness of countenance can arise only from sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid;" because the unexpected question obliged him to explain the cause of his sorrow, and he could not tell how the king would view the matter, nor whether he would favour his ardent desire to assist his fellow-countrymen in Judah.</body></html>
