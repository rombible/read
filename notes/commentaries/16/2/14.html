It seems to have stood almost at the southernmost part of the city, at the mouth of the narrow valley of the Tyropoeon.

These requests were also granted. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; in Sol 4:13; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-5.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:5</a>, signifies a park or orchard; it is a word of Aryan origin (in Armenian pardez, the garden round the house, in Greek &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), and is explained either from the Sanscrit parta-da, a superior district, or (by Haug) from the Zend. pairi-daza, a fenced-in place. In Old-Persian it probably denoted the king's pleasure-grounds, and in our verse a royal wood or forest. Of the situation of this park nothing reliable can be ascertained. As wood for extensive buildings was to be taken from it, the sycamore forest in the low plains, which had been the property of King David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-28.htm">1 Chronicles 27:28</a>), and became, after the overthrow of the Davidic dynasty, first a Babylonian, and then a Persian possession, may be intended.<p>(Note: Older expositors supposed a regio a Libano ad Antilibanum protensa et arboribus amoenissimus consita to be meant. In this view, indeed, they followed Sol 4:13, but incorrectly. Cler. thought it to be a tractus terrarum in Judaea, qui Paradisus regius dicebatur. Josephus speaks (Ant. viii. 7. 3) of fine gardens and ponds at Etham, seven miles south of Jerusalem, where Solomon often made pleasure excursions. Hence Ewald (Gesch. iv. p. 169, comp. iii. p. 328) thinks that the &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1468;&#1505; which belonged to the king must have been Solomon's old royal park at Aetham, which in the time of Nehemiah had become a Persian domain, and that the hill town lying not far to the west of it, and now called by the Arabs Fureidis, i.e., paradisaic, may have received its Hebrew name Beth-Kerem, i.e., house of vineyards, from similar pleasure-grounds. Hereupon Bertheau grounds the further conjecture, that "the whole district from Aetham to the hill of Paradise, situate about a league east-south-east of Aetham, may from its nature have been once covered with forest; and no hesitation would be felt in connecting the name of the mountain Gebel el-Fureidis or el-Feridis (Paradise-hill - hill which rises in a Pardes) with the Pardes in question, if it could be proved that this name was already in existence in prae-Christian times." All these conjectures rest on very uncertain bases. The Dshebel Fureidis is also called the Hill of the Franks. See the description of it in Robinson's Palestine, ii. p. 392f., and Tobler, Topographie von Jerusalem, ii. pp. 565-572.)<p>&#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, to timber, to overlay, to cover with beams (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-11.htm">2 Chronicles 34:11</a>) the gates of the citadel which belongs to the house, i.e., to the temple. This citadel - &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;, in Greek &#x392;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; - by the temple is mentioned here for the first time; for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-19.htm">1 Chronicles 29:19</a>, the whole temple is called &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;&#1492;. It was certainly situate on the same place where Hyrcanus I, son of Simon Maccabaeus, or the kings of the Asmonean race, built the akro'polis and called it Baris (Jos. Ant. xv. 11. 4, comp. with xviii. 4. 3). This was subsequently rebuilt by Herod when he repaired and enlarged the temple, and named Antonia, in honour of his friend Mark Antony. It was a citadel of considerable size, provided with corner towers, walls, chambers, and spacious courts, built on a north-western side of the external chambers of the temple, for the defence of that edifice, and did not extend the entire length of the north side of the present Haram, as Robinson (see Biblical Researches, p. 300) seeks to show; comp., on the other hand, Tobler, Topographic von Jerusalem, i. p. 688f., and Rosen, Haram von Jerusalem, p. 25f. &#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514; is coordinate with &#1500;&#1511;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;: "and for the walls of the city;" the timber not being used for building the wall itself, but for the gates (<a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-3.htm">Nehemiah 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-6.htm">Nehemiah 3:6</a>). "And for the house into which I come (to dwell)." This must be Nehemiah's official residence as Pecha. For though it is not expressly stated in the present chapter that Nehemiah was appointed Pecha (governor) by Artaxerxes, yet Nehemiah himself tells us, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-14.htm">Nehemiah 5:14</a>, that he had been Pecha from the twentieth year of Artaxerxes. Former governors had perhaps no official residence becoming their position. By &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; the temple cannot, as older expositors thought, be intended. This request also was granted by the king, "according to the good hand of my God upon me;" comp. rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-6.htm">Ezra 7:6</a>. </body></html>
