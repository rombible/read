We are not limited to certain moments in our addresses to the King of kings, but have liberty to go to him at all times; approaches to the throne of grace are never out of season. But the sense of God's displeasure and the afflictions of his people, are causes of sorrow to the children of God, under which no earthly delights can comfort. The king encouraged Nehemiah to tell his mind. This gave him boldness to speak; much more may the invitation Christ has given us to pray, and the promise that we shall speed, encourage us to come boldly to the throne of grace. Nehemiah prayed to the God of heaven, as infinitely above even this mighty monarch. He lifted up his heart to that God who understands the language of the heart. Nor should we ever engage in any pursuit in which it would be wrong for us thus to seek and expect the Divine direction, assistance, and blessing. There was an immediate answer to his prayer; for the seed of Jacob never sought the God of Jacob in vain.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nisan was the name given by the Persian Jews to the month previously called "Abib," the first month of the Jewish year, or that which followed the vernal equinox.

Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xi. 4, 8, ‘The first month, which according to the Macedonians is called Xanthicus, but according to us Nisan.’ Its meaning is uncertain; according to some its root-idea is ‘fruitfulness,’ according to others ‘beginning’ or ‘origin.’ It corresponds to the month of which the older Israelite name was ‘Abib’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-4.htm" title="This day came you out in the month Abib.">Exodus 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm" title="You shall keep the feast of unleavened bread: (you shall eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded you, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it you came out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:)">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-18.htm" title="The feast of unleavened bread shall you keep.

In the year 445 Pericles had obtained control of Athenian affairs; and a thirty years’ truce was concluded between Athens and Sparta. At Rome the conflict between patricians and plebeians was being waged; the deposition of the Decemvirs had occurred only four years before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that <span class="ital">wine</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">when wine.</span> The R.V. shows the connexion of the sentences. The present clause states the occasion, when Nehemiah preferred his request. ‘When wine was before him;’ i.e. when the king was at a repast, and the cupbearers were (or a cupbearer was) in attendance. At such a time the king would naturally remark upon any alteration of demeanour in a favourite ‘cupbearer.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Rawlinson (<span class="ital">Ancient Monarchies</span>, vol. iii. p. 214) the Persian king himself rarely dined with his guests. For the most part he dined alone. Sometimes he admitted to his table the queen and two or three of his children. Sometimes at a ‘banquet of wine’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-2.htm" title="And the king said again to Esther on the second day at the banquet of wine, What is your petition, queen Esther? and it shall be granted you: and what is your request? and it shall be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.">Esther 7:2</a>) a certain number of privileged boon companions were received.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">before him</span>] Another reading is found in the LXX. ‘before me,’ (<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἦν ὁ οἶνος ἐνώπιον ἐμοῦ</span>), which is followed in the Arabic version and was known to the translators of the Syriac. The change needed in the Hebrew to give this rendering is very slight, being only the omission of a single letter (<span class="ital">vaw</span>), which is read once instead of being repeated (<span class="ital">l’phânâ</span>(<span class="ital">y</span>) <span class="ital">vaessa</span> instead of <span class="ital">l’phânâv vaessa</span>). It has been very ingeniously maintained that this is the right reading, and that the words ‘when wine was before me’ denote ‘when my turn came round to attend as cupbearer at the royal table.’ According to this explanation, the clause accounts for the delay of three or four months, before Nehemiah made his appeal to the king; it also accounts for the king not having before recognised the sadness of his cupbearer, this being the first occasion on which he had appeared in the royal presence since the sad news arrived in the month Chislev.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But it does not seem likely that a cupbearer, who enjoyed the favour of the king, should have appeared so rarely in his presence as this view supposes. The LXX. reading makes practically no distinction in meaning between the clauses ‘wine was before me’ and ‘I took up the wine,’ and it is a pure assumption, that the former was a phrase for the rotation of the cupbearer’s office.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the other hand, the Hebrew text gives with great minuteness full circumstances of the event: (1) the month and year; (2) the time of day, at the dinner; (3) the stage at the dinner, when the cupbearer offered the king wine. It distinguishes between ‘wine … before him,’ the occasion of the repast, and ‘I took up … the wine,’ the act of presenting the royal cup.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and I took up</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">that I took up.</span> The cupbearer’s duties were to pour out the wine, to taste it so as to prevent any scheme of poisoning, and to present it to the king. Perhaps the words ‘took up’ relate to the reverential gesture with which the goblet was offered.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the wine</span>] ‘The vines of Helbon were cultivated for the special purpose of supplying the Persian king with wine’ (Rawlinson, <span class="ital">Anc. Mon.</span>, 3. p. 226). Helbon, a village near Damascus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-18.htm" title="Damascus was your merchant in the multitude of the wares of your making, for the multitude of all riches; in the wine of Helbon, and white wool.">Ezekiel 27:18</a>), seems to be the place intended by Strabo and Athenaeus, who call it ‘Chalybon.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Now I had not been</span> beforetime <span class="ital">sad in his presence</span>] These words have given rise to considerable difficulty. There is nothing to show that this was the first occasion on which Nehemiah had stood before the king since the month Chislev. To suppose that the king had been absent for several months from Shushan would of course get over the difficulty. But we have no evidence upon which to base such an assertion. The passage, as it stands, suggests that Nehemiah was performing his usual duties as on former days. If so, how are we to explain Nehemiah’s words? For surely we may suppose his sadness to have dated from the arrival of the distressing news (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-2.htm" title="That Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and certain men of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 1:2</a>). Various explanations of the words have been attempted; e.g.,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) ‘Now I was not evil in his sight,’ i.e. he was well disposed to me. The rendering ‘evil’ instead of ‘sad’ is equally in accordance with the Hebrew, but the use of the same adjective in the sense of ‘sad’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2</a> (see note) is fatal to this interpretation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) ‘To suppose that I should not have been sad in his presence!’ Grammatically possible, an exclamation is not a probable turn of the sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) ‘And I was not sad in his presence.’ The preterite tense is understood to refer to this particular occasion, and not generally to past time. This interpretation supposes that Nehemiah did <span class="ital">not</span> wear a sad countenance, but that the quick eye of his royal master perceived that something was wrong with his favourite. This, it is claimed, would account for the perturbation of Nehemiah described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2</a>. But it is sufficient to object that (<span class="ital">a</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-2.htm" title="Why the king said to me, Why is your countenance sad, seeing you are not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid,">Nehemiah 2:2</a>, leaves us to suppose that Nehemiah’s sadness was clearly visible; (<span class="ital">b</span>) the 1st pers. sing. of the preterite of the auxiliary is used in three other passages in this book and refers to past time indefinitely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-1.htm" title="The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,">Nehemiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm" title="O LORD, I beseech you, let now your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant, and to the prayer of your servants, who desire to fear your name: and prosper, I pray you, your servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-6.htm" title="But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I to the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:">Nehemiah 13:6</a>). Had, Nehemiah wished to say that he was not sad on this occasion he would not have employed the auxiliary at all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(4) Accepting the English rendering, ‘Now I had not been <span class="ital">beforetime</span> sad in his presence,’ it seems necessary to assume that Nehemiah chose his opportunity and deliberately gave occasion for the king’s enquiry. It was forbidden for royal servants to appear before the king gloomy and unhappy. It was ill-omened, and suggested discontent and plotting at the court, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-2.htm" title="And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.">Esther 4:2</a>. Nehemiah had not therefore beforetime been sad in the king’s presence. He had not made up his mind up to this time what steps to take or what petition to present. Now, however, after his prayer to God (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/1-5.htm" title="And said, I beseech you, O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him and observe his commandments:...">Nehemiah 1:5-11</a>), he had been able to resolve upon his course of action. He appeared before the king at the banquet table in a state of sadness and dejection, which could not possibly escape the king’s notice when he stood before him as cupbearer and presented him the cup.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the month Nisan</span>. The fourth month after Chisleu, corresponding nearly to our April. How it came about that Nehemiah did not put the king's favour to the proof until more than three months had gone by we can only conjecture. Perhaps the court had been absent from Susa, passing the winter at Babylon, as it sometimes did, and he had not accompanied it. Perhaps, though present at the court, he had not been called on to discharge his office, his turn not having arrived. Possibly, though performing his duties from time to time, he had found no opportunity of unbosoming himself, the king not having noticed his grief. He. may even have done his best to conceal it, for Persian subjects were expected to be perfectly happy in the presence of their king. He had probably formed no plan, but waited in the confident hope that God's providence would so order events, that some occasion would arise whereof he might take advantage. <span class="cmt_word">In the twentieth year of Artaxerxes</span>. Like Daniel, Zechariah, Haggai, and Ezra, Nehemiah dates events by the regnal year of the existing Persian king. His Artaxerxes is, by common consent, the same as Ezra's, and can scarcely be supposed to be any monarch but Longimanus, who reigned from  <span class="date">B.C. 465</span> to  <span class="date">B.C. 425</span>. <span class="cmt_word">Now I had not been beforetime sad in his presence</span>. Other renderings have been proposed, but this is probably the true meaning. Hitherto I had always worn a cheerful countenance before him - now it was otherwise - my sorrow showed itself in spite of me. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Let Thine ear be attentive, and Thine eyes open," like <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-40.htm">2 Chronicles 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-15.htm">2 Chronicles 7:15</a> - &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;, that Thou mayest hearken to the prayer of Thy servant, which I pray, and how I confess concerning ... &#1502;&#1514;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; still depends upon &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; in the sense of: and what I confess concerning the sins. &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; does not here mean to-day, but now, at this time, as the addition "day and night" compared with &#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-4.htm">Nehemiah 1:4</a> shows.
