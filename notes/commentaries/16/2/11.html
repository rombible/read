As a Horonite, he was probably a native of one of the Bethhorons, the upper or the lower (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-5.htm">2 Chronicles 8:5</a>), and therefore born within the limits of the old kingdom of Samaria. Tobiah seems to have been an Ammonite slave, high in the favor of Sanballat, whom he probably served as secretary <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17-19</a> and chief adviser.<p>It grieved them - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/4-4.htm">Ezra 4:4-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/5-6.htm">Ezra 5:6-17</a>. The revival of Jerusalem as a great and strong city, which was Nehemiah's aim, was likely to interfere with the prosperity, or at any rate the eminence, of Samaria. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11, 12.

Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>. After the long journey, three days of rest were necessary. STEPS TAKEN BY NEHEMIAH PRELIMINARY TO HIS BUILDING OF THE WALL, AND FIRST APPEARANCE OF OPPOSITION (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12-20</a>). Hitherto Nehemiah had communicated his purpose to no one but the king and queen of Persia. He expected opposition, and resolved to baffle his opponents, as long as possible, by concealing his exact designs. Even when further concealment was on the point of becoming impossible, he made his survey of the wall by night, that it might escape observation. At last, the time for action being come, he was obliged to lay the matter before the head men of the city (ver. 17), whom he easily persuaded when he assured them of Artaxerxes' consent and goodwill Preparations then began to be made; and immediately murmurs of opposition arose. Three opponents are now spoken of - Sanballat, Tobiah, and an Arabian, Geshem or Gashmu, not previously mentioned. These persons appear to have sent a formal message to the authorities of Jerualem (ver. 19), taxing them with an intention to rebel Nehemiah made no direct reply to this charge, but boldly stated his resolve to "arise and build," and denied Sanballat's right to interfere with him (ver. 20). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then the king, feeling interested, asked him: For what dost thou make request? &#1506;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to make request for or concerning a thing, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-23.htm">Ezra 8:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/4-8.htm">Esther 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/7-7.htm">Esther 7:7</a>. The question shows that the king was inclined to relieve the distress of Jerusalem which had been just stated to him. "And so I prayed to the God of heaven," to ensure divine assistance in the request he was about to lay before the king. Then Nehemiah answered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-5.htm">Nehemiah 2:5</a>), "If it please the king, and if thy servant is well-pleasing before thee, (I beg) that thou wouldest send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it." &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489;, here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm">Esther 5:14</a>, is of like meaning with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497;&#1496;&#1489; or &#1496;&#1468;&#1493;&#1489;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/8-5.htm">Esther 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-4.htm">2 Samuel 18:4</a> : if thy servant is right in thine eyes, i.e., if he thinks rightly concerning the matter in question. The matter of his request is directly combined with this conditional clause by &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, the connecting term, I beg, being easily supplied from the king's question: For what dost thou beg? </body></html>
