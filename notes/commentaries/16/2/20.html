The closing words imply that, as in the days of Zerubbabel, the Samaritan enemies desired really to have their share in the undertaking. Nehemiah makes Zerubbabel’s answer, but strengthens it; they had nothing in common with Jerusalem, not even a place in its memorials, save one of shame.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/nehemiah/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19,20 The enmity of the serpent's seed against the cause of Christ is confined to no age or nation.

For I was the king's cupbearer.">Nehemiah 1:11</a>. The Vulgate ‘juvat nos,’ the present tense corresponding to the following clause ‘we are his servants,’ is quite permissible: but is not so suitable to the occasion of Nehemiah’s reply.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we his servants</span>] as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-6.htm" title="Let your ear now be attentive, and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of your servant, which I pray before you now, day and night, for the children of Israel your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you: both I and my father's house have sinned.">Nehemiah 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-10.htm" title="Now these are your servants and your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power, and by your strong hand.">Nehemiah 1:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">arise and build</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-18.htm" title="Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good on me; as also the king's words that he had spoken to me.

The LXX. by a strange error renders <span class="greekheb">δοῦλοι αὐτοῦ καθαροί</span>‚ <span class="greekheb">καὶ οἰκοδομήσομεν</span>, reading ‘n’qiyyim’ for ‘naqûm.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">no portion, nor right, nor memorial</span>] These words closely resemble the declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-3.htm" title="But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the fathers of Israel, said to them, You have nothing to do with us to build an house to our God; but we ourselves together will build to the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us.">Ezra 4:3</a>, and imply some sort of claim on the part of these adversaries to a share in the fortunes of Jerusalem. If so, the adversaries must be regarded as mainly consisting of the Samaritan community. Nehemiah renouncing connexion with the Samaritans, affirms that they have no share in the present community, no ground for claiming it in the future, no memorial or justification of such claim in the past.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">no portion</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2 Samuel 20:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nor right</span>] The word here used has generally the sense of righteousness.

The word is rendered ‘remembrance’ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-11.htm" title="There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that shall come after.">Ecclesiastes 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-16.htm" title="For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall all be forgotten.

Cf. ‘write this for a memorial in a book’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-14.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly put out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven.">Exodus 17:14</a>); ‘a book of remembrance’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm" title="Then they that feared the LORD spoke often one to another: and the LORD listened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that thought on his name.">Malachi 3:16</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then answered I.</span> It is remarkable that Nehemiah takes no notice of the serious charge brought against him, does not say that he had the king's permission, but rather leaves the "<span class="accented">adversaries"</span> to suppose that he had not. Perhaps he thought that to reveal the truth would drive them to some desperate attempt, and therefore suppressed it<span class="cmt_word">. The God of heaven, he will prosper us</span>. Instead of a human, Nehemiah claims a Divine sanction for his proceedings. He and his brethren will build as <span class="accented">servants of the God of heaven.</span> Compare the answer made to Tatnai in Zerubbabel's time - "We are <span class="accented">the servants of the God of heaven</span> and earth, and build the house that was builded these many years ago" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/5-11.htm">Ezra 5:11</a><span class="cmt_word">). Ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</span> As the claim of the Samaritans to interfere in the affairs of the Jews had been disallowed when they came with an offer of aid (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-2.htm">Ezra 4:2, 3</a>), so now, when their interference is hostile in character, it is still more fiercely and indignantly rejected. They are told that they have no part in Jerusalem, no right, not even so much as a place in the recollections of the inhabitants. Their interference is officious, impertinent - what have they to do with Nehemiah, or the Israelites, or Jerusalem? Let them be content to manage the affairs of their own idolatrous community, and not trouble the worshippers of the true God. Nehemiah avoids opposition by concealment as long as he can; but when opposition nevertheless appears, he meets it with defiance. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And I went on to the fountain-gate, and to the king's pool, and there was no room for the beast to come through under me." The very name of the fountain-or well-gate points to the foundation of Siloah (see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>); hence it lay on the eastern declivity of Zion, but not in the district or neighbourhood of the present Bb el Mogharibeh, in which tradition finds the ancient dung-gate, but much farther south, in the neighbourhood of the pool of Siloah; see rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. The King's pool is probably the same which Josephus (bell. Jud. v. 4. 2) calls &#x3a3;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;, and places east of the spring of Siloah, and which is supposed by Robinson (Palestine, ii. pp. 149, 159) and Thenius (das vorexil. Jerus., appendix to a commentary on the books of the Kings, p. 20) to be the present Fountain of the Virgin. Bertheau, however, on the other hand, rightly objects that the Fountain of the Virgin lying deep in the rock, and now reached by a descent of thirty steps, could not properly be designated a pool. He tries rather to identify the King's pool with the outlet of a canal investigated by Tobler (Topogr. i. p. 91f.), which the latter regards as a conduit for rain-water, fluid impurities, or even the blood of sacrificed animals; but Bertheau as an aqueduct which, perhaps at the place where its entrance is now found, once filled a pool, of which, indeed, no trace has as yet been discovered. But apart from the difficulty of calling the outlet of a canal a pool (Arnold in Herzog's Realencycl. xviii. p. 656), the circumstance, that Tobler could find in neither of the above-described canals any trace of high antiquity, tells against this conjecture. Much more may be said in favour of the view of E. G. Schultz (Jerusalem, p. 58f.), that the half-choked-up pool near Ain Silwan may be the King's pool and Solomon's pool; for travellers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries mention a piscina grandis foras and natatoria Silo at the mouth of the fountain of Siloah (comp. Leyrer in Herzog's Realencycl. xvi. p. 372). See also rem. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-15.htm">Nehemiah 3:15</a>. Here there was no room for the beast to get through, the road being choked up with the ruins of the walls that had been destroyed, so that Nehemiah was obliged to dismount. </body></html>
