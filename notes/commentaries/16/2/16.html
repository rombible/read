Sanballat is called the Horonite either after his birthplace or place of residence, yet certainly not from Horonaim in Moab, as older expositors imagined (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-5.htm">Isaiah 15:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-34.htm">Jeremiah 48:34</a>), since he would then have been called a Moabite, but from either the upper or nether Beth-horon, formerly belonging to the tribe of Ephraim (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/16-3.htm">Joshua 16:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-5.htm">Joshua 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-13.htm">Joshua 18:13</a>), and therefore in the time of Nehemiah certainly appertaining to the region of the Samaritans (Berth.). Tobiah the Ammonite is called &#1492;&#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, the servant, probably as being a servant or official of the Persian king. These two individuals were undoubtedly influential chiefs of the neighbouring hostile nations of Samaritans and Ammonites, and sought by alliances with Jewish nobles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-17.htm">Nehemiah 6:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-4.htm">Nehemiah 13:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-28.htm">Nehemiah 13:28</a>) to frustrate, whether by force or stratagem, the efforts of Ezra and Nehemiah for the internal and external security of Judah. Nehemiah mentions thus early their annoyance at his arrival, by way of hinting beforehand at their subsequent machinations to delay the fortifying of Jerusalem. </body></html>
