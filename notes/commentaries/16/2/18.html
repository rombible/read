This, however, would scarcely have had any great effect had he not been able to appeal further to <span class="cmt_word">the king's words that he had spoken</span>.

Nehemiah's address had all the effect he hoped for from it. He was anxious to carry the nation with him, and induce them, one and. all, to engage heartily in the work, which must be accomplished, if it was to be accomplished at all, by something like a burst of enthusiasm. Such a burst he evokes, and its result is seen in the next chapter. Almost the whole people came forward, and set to work with zeal <span class="cmt_word">So they strengthened their hands for this good work</span>. The original is briefer, and more emphatic - "And they strengthened their hands for good." They embraced the good cause, took the good part, set themselves to work heartily on the right side. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Nehemiah's arrival at Jerusalem. He surveys the wall, and resolves to restore it. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-11.htm">Nehemiah 2:11</a> Having arrived at Jerusalem and rested three days (as Ezra had also done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/8-32.htm">Ezra 8:32</a>), he arose in the night, and some few men with him, to ride round the wall of the city, and get a notion of its condition. His reason for taking but few men with him is given in the following sentence: "I had told no man what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem." Although he had come to Jerusalem with the resolution of fortifying the city by restoring its circumvallation, he spoke of this to no one until he had ascertained, by an inspection of the wall, the magnitude and extent of the work to be accomplished. For, being aware of the hostility of Sanballat and Tobiah, he desired to keep his intention secret until he felt certain of the possibility of carrying it into execution. Hence he made his survey of the wall by night, and took but few men with him, and those on foot, for the sake of not exciting attention. The beast on which he rode was either a horse or a mule. </body></html>
