Those who diligently search the Scriptures, find things written there which they have forgotten. This feast of tabernacles was a representation of the believer's tabernacle state in this world, and a type of the holy joy of the gospel church. The conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ, is foretold under the figure of this feast, Zec 14:16. True religion will render us strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We read and hear the word acceptably and profitably, when we do according to what is written therein; when what appears to be our duty is revived, after it has been neglected. They minded the substance; else the ceremony had been of no use. They did it, rejoicing in God and his goodness. These are the means which the Spirit of God crowns with success, in bringing the hearts of sinners to tremble and to become humbled before God. But those are enemies to their own growth in holiness, who always indulge sorrow, even for sin, and put away from them the consolations tendered by the word and Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To understand - Rather, "to consider." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 8:9-15.

But notwithstanding the painful remembrances of their national sins which the reading of the law awakened, the people were exhorted to cherish the feelings of joy and thankfulness associated with a sacred festival (see on [489]Le 23:24).

Are we to suppose that they too were ignorant of the full contents of ‘the law’? This is possible, if the contents of ‘the law’ had hitherto been chiefly known by oral tradition or by disconnected writings. If this had been the case and Ezra had made himself master of the complete continuous ‘law,’ we shall be able to understand the action of ‘the priests and Levites.’ From the subsequent verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/8-14.htm" title="And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month:...">Nehemiah 8:14-15</a>) it appears that Ezra supplied them not so much with profound interpretations of the Law as with statements relative to its contents and positive enactments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even to understand</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">even to give attention to.</span> The Hebrew word (<span class="ital">l’haskîl</span>) denotes intelligent consideration, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/41-1.htm" title="Blessed is he that considers the poor: the LORD will deliver him in time of trouble.">Psalm 41:1</a>, ‘Blessed is he that considereth the poor;’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/101-2.htm" title="I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way.

Once let the sweetness of the Divine word be tasted and appreciated, and there springs up in the heart instantly a desire for more - a wish to continue in the study - a feeling like that of the Psalmist when he said, "Lord, what love have I unto thy law: <span class="accented">all the day long</span> is my study in it" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-97.htm">Psalm 119:97</a>).
