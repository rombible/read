Those who diligently search the Scriptures, find things written there which they have forgotten. This feast of tabernacles was a representation of the believer's tabernacle state in this world, and a type of the holy joy of the gospel church. The conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ, is foretold under the figure of this feast, Zec 14:16. True religion will render us strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We read and hear the word acceptably and profitably, when we do according to what is written therein; when what appears to be our duty is revived, after it has been neglected. They minded the substance; else the ceremony had been of no use. They did it, rejoicing in God and his goodness. These are the means which the Spirit of God crowns with success, in bringing the hearts of sinners to tremble and to become humbled before God. But those are enemies to their own growth in holiness, who always indulge sorrow, even for sin, and put away from them the consolations tendered by the word and Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is not the intention of the writer to state that the Feast of tabernacles had not been kept from the time of Joshua until this occasion (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-2.htm">1 Kings 8:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>); but that there had been no such celebration as this since Joshua's time.

This is the usual explanation, so also LXX. <span class="greekheb">ἀνέγνω</span>. Vulg. ‘legit.’ According to another interpretation the 3rd pers. sing. is impersonal = ‘and one read,’ ‘there was reading.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the book of the law of God</span>] The command to read at the Feast of Tabernacles only applied to the special usage of the Sabbatic year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,...">Deuteronomy 31:10-11</a>), and it is clear from the context in that passage that Moses in using the words ‘thou shalt read this law’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-11.htm" title="When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.">Deuteronomy 31:11</a>) is speaking especially of the Deuteronomic law which he is described as having written and committed to the priests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm" title="And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, which bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm" title="Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>. It is a mistake therefore to connect this reading of ‘the law’ by Ezra with any special obedience to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-10.htm" title="And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles,...">Deuteronomy 31:10-11</a>, unless it be assumed that it was the Sabbatic year, and that the law read was the Deuteronomic law. For neither assumption is there any sufficient warrant. The fact that the reading went on for seven days makes it probable that the whole, or at any rate by far the greater portion, of the Torah was read.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the eighth day</span>] This eighth day was not originally part of the feast, but an extra day commanded by the Priestly Law to be observed as ‘an holy convocation’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm" title="Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.">Leviticus 23:39</a>). Its celebration closed, as it were, the festival calendar of the Jewish sacred year. We do not hear of its observance in early times. As we might expect, it is not mentioned in the brief festival notice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm" title="And the feast of harvest, the first fruits of your labors, which you have sown in the field: and the feast of ingathering, which is in the end of the year, when you have gathered in your labors out of the field.">Exodus 23:16</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/16-13.htm" title="You shall observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after that you have gathered in your corn and your wine:...">Deuteronomy 16:13-17</a> it is not spoken of, it is only said ‘Seven days shalt thou keep a feast.’ In <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days....">1 Kings 8:65-66</a>, we are told that after the Feast of Tabernacles Solomon sent the people away on the 8th day. In the Priestly Law, however, the observance of this 8th day is insisted upon as ‘a holy convocation,’ ‘a solemn assembly,’ on which ‘no servile work’ is to be done, ‘the eighth day shall be a solemn rest’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm" title="Seven days you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation to you; and you shall offer an offering made by fire to the LORD: it is a solemn assembly; and you shall do no servile work therein.">Leviticus 23:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm" title="Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you have gathered in the fruit of the land, you shall keep a feast to the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.">Leviticus 23:39</a>). It is interesting, therefore, to take notice that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/7-8.htm" title="Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt....">2 Chronicles 7:8-9</a> the observance of this 8th day is recorded, although not mentioned in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/8-65.htm" title="And at that time Solomon held a feast, and all Israel with him, a great congregation, from the entering in of Hamath to the river of Egypt, before the LORD our God, seven days and seven days, even fourteen days....">1 Kings 8:65-66</a>. The Chronicler recounts the celebration of the Feast of Tabernacles in accordance with his knowledge of the Priestly Law. Our passage agrees with the later observance and with the Priestly Law. The complete disappearance of the originally distinct character of ‘the eighth day’ is shown in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/10-6.htm" title="And they kept the eight days with gladness, as in the feast of the tabernacles, remembering that not long afore they had held the feast of the tabernacles, when as they wandered in the mountains and dens like beasts.">2Ma 10:6</a> ‘eight days … as in the feast of tabernacles.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a solemn assembly</span> (Heb. <span class="ital">a restrain assembly</span>)] R.V.

The emphasis of this appeal to authority is perhaps to be explained by the fact that in early times the 8th day had not been observed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/nehemiah/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Also day by day...  . he read in the book of the law</span>. Ezra must be intended in the form "he read," though there has been no mention of him since verse 13.
