Masters of families should bring their families with them to the public worship of God. Women and children have souls to save, and are therefore to acquaint themselves with the word of God, and to attend on the means of grace. Little ones, as they come to reason, must be trained up in religion. Ministers when they go to the pulpit, should take their Bibles with them; Ezra did so. Thence they must fetch their knowledge; according to that rule they must speak, and must show that they do so. Reading the Scriptures in religious assemblies is an ordinance of God, whereby he is honoured, and his church edified. Those who hear the word, should understand it, else it is to them but an empty sound of words. It is therefore required of teachers that they explain the word, and give the sense of it. Reading is good, and preaching is good, but expounding makes reading the better understood, and preaching the more convincing. It has pleased God in almost every age of the church to raise up, not only those who have preached the gospel, but also those who have given their views of Divine truth in writing; and though many who have attempted to explain Scripture, have darkened counsel by words without knowledge, yet the labours of others are of excellent use. All that we hear must, however, be brought to the test of Scripture. They heard readily, and minded every word. The word of God demands attention. If through carelessness we let much slip in hearing, there is danger that through forgetfulness we shall let all slip after hearing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stood up - The attitude of attention and respect.

Rather ‘they rose to their feet,’ signifying by this gesture their reverence for ‘the law’ that was to be read. After Ezra’s blessing and the response (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-6.htm" title="And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to the ground.">Nehemiah 8:6</a></span>), they probably resumed their seats. ‘Standing’ was sometimes the posture of prayer denoting humility, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-26.htm" title="And she said, Oh my lord, as your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman that stood by you here, praying to the LORD.">1 Samuel 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-22.htm" title="And Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven:">1 Kings 8:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm" title="And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as his eyes to heaven, but smote on his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.">Luke 18:13</a>.

The Jews commonly sat to hear and stood up to pray; but in hearing they occasionally stood up, to do greater honour to the person or the occasion (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-20.htm">Judges 3:20</a>). It is not to be supposed that they stood during the whole of the six hours that Ezra's reading lasted. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nehemiah/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And God put into my heart, i.e., God inspired me with the resolution; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-12.htm">Nehemiah 2:12</a>.
