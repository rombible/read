Those who diligently search the Scriptures, find things written there which they have forgotten. This feast of tabernacles was a representation of the believer's tabernacle state in this world, and a type of the holy joy of the gospel church. The conversion of the nations to the faith of Christ, is foretold under the figure of this feast, Zec 14:16. True religion will render us strangers and pilgrims upon earth. We read and hear the word acceptably and profitably, when we do according to what is written therein; when what appears to be our duty is revived, after it has been neglected. They minded the substance; else the ceremony had been of no use. They did it, rejoicing in God and his goodness. These are the means which the Spirit of God crowns with success, in bringing the hearts of sinners to tremble and to become humbled before God. But those are enemies to their own growth in holiness, who always indulge sorrow, even for sin, and put away from them the consolations tendered by the word and Spirit of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Feast of tabernacles had fallen into abeyance either entirely, or as regarded the dwelling in booths <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm">Nehemiah 8:17</a>, since the time when it was kept by Zerubbabel <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-4.htm">Ezra 3:4</a>.

The Rabbis understand &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  the Chaldee &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, of a rendering of the law into the vulgar tongue, i.e., a paraphrase in the Chaldee language for those who were not acquainted with the ancient Hebrew. But this cannot be shown to be the meaning of &#1508;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, this word being used in the Targums for the Hebrew &#1504;&#1511;&#1489; (&#1511;&#1489;&#1489;), e.g., <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-16.htm">Leviticus 24:16</a>, and for &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. It is more correct to suppose a paraphrastic exposition and application of the law (Pfeiffer, dubia vex. p. 480), but not "a distinct recitation according to appointed rules" (Gusset. and Bertheau). &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1501; is infin. abs. instead of the temp. finit.: and gave the sense, made the law comprehensible to the hearers. &#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, not with older interpreters, Luther ("so that what was read was understood"), and de Wette, "and they (the Levites) made what was read comprehensible," which would be a mere tautology, but with the lxx, Vulgate, and others, "and they (the hearers) attended to the reading," or, "obtained an understanding of what was read" (&#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1503;, like <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-12.htm">Nehemiah 8:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-23.htm">Daniel 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-11.htm">Daniel 10:11</a>). Vitringa (de syn. vet. p. 420) already gives the correct meaning: de doctoribus narratur, quod legerint et dederint intellectum, de autitoribus, quod lectum intellexerint. The manner of proceeding with this reading is not quite clear. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5-8</a>, the Levites alone seem to have read to the people out of the book of the law, and to have explained what they read to their auditors; while according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>, Ezra read to the assembled people, and the ears of all were attentive to the book of the law, while we are told in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-5.htm">Nehemiah 8:5</a> that Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people. If, however, we regard <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-4.htm">Nehemiah 8:4-8</a> as only a more detailed description of what is related <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-2.htm">Nehemiah 8:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>, it is obvious that both Ezra and the thirteen Levites mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-7.htm">Nehemiah 8:7</a> read out of the law. Hence the occurrence may well have taken place as follows: Ezra first read a section of the law, and the Levites then expounded to the people the portion just read; the only point still doubtful being whether the thirteen (fourteen) Levites expounded in succession, or whether they all did this at the same time to different groups of people. </body></html>
