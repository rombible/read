And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The God of heaven - This title of the Almighty, which is Persian rather than Jewish (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>), is a favorite one with Nehemiah, who had been born and brought up in Persia. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 1:4-11.

There is however no connexion, as commentators have supposed, between the Hebrew words used here and a similar root meaning ‘a pledge.’ The Vulgate, adopting a different derivation, has ‘vanitate seducti sumus.’ The LXX. rendering <span class="greekheb">διαλύσει διελύσαμεν πρὸς σὲ</span> and that of a few MSS. <span class="greekheb">ματαιώσει ἐματαιώθημεν ἐν σοί</span> (Field’s Orig.

By the addition "son of Hachaliah," Nehemiah is distinguished from others of the same name (e.g., from Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-16.htm">Nehemiah 3:16</a>). Another Nehemiah, too, returned from captivity with Zerubbabel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-2.htm">Ezra 2:2</a>. Of Hachaliah we know nothing further, his name occurring but once more, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-2.htm">Nehemiah 10:2</a>, in conjunction, as here, with that of Nehemiah. Eusebius and Jerome assert that Nehemiah was of the tribe of Judah, - a statement which may be correct, but is unsupported by any evidence from the Old Testament. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-11.htm">Nehemiah 1:11</a>, he was cup-bearer to the Persian king, and was, at his own request, appointed for some time Pecha, i.e., governor, of Judah.

"In the month Chisleu of the twentieth year I was in the citadel of Susa" - such is the manner in which Nehemiah commences the narrative of his labours for Jerusalem. Chisleu is the ninth month of the year, answering to our December. Comp. <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-1.htm">Zechariah 7:1</a>, 1 Macc. 4:52. The twentieth year is, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-1.htm">Nehemiah 2:1</a>, the twentieth year of Artaxerxes Longimanus. On the citadel of Susa, see further details in the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-2.htm">Daniel 8:2</a>. Susa was the capital of the province Susiana, and its citadel, called by the Greeks Memnoneion, was strongly fortified. The kings of Persia were accustomed to reside here during some months of the year.</body></html>
