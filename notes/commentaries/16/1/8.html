And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled. All the names written in the book of life, are those of penitent sinners, not of self-righteous persons, who think they have no need of repentance.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/nehemiah/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The God of heaven - This title of the Almighty, which is Persian rather than Jewish (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-23.htm">2 Chronicles 36:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-2.htm">Ezra 1:2</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-10.htm">Ezra 6:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>), is a favorite one with Nehemiah, who had been born and brought up in Persia. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/nehemiah/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ne 1:4-11.

No passage in the Pentateuch exactly agrees with it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-34.htm" title="And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed year by year, to burn on the altar of the LORD our God, as it is written in the law:">Nehemiah 10:34</a>). This may be shown by the words used in the first sentence. The Hebrew word for ‘I will scatter’ is only found in Deuteronomy in the Pentateuch: the Hebrew word for ‘transgress’ only occurs once in Deuteronomy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm" title="Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>), but in quite a different context from the threat of dispersion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The threat of dispersion is found in the Pentateuch in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm" title="And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.">Leviticus 26:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-27.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and you shall be left few in number among the heathen, where the LORD shall lead you.">Deuteronomy 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm" title="And the LORD shall scatter you among all people, from the one end of the earth even to the other; and there you shall serve other gods, which neither you nor your fathers have known, even wood and stone.">Deuteronomy 28:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm" title="That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.">Deuteronomy 30:3</a>. The promise of restoration is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm" title="But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul.">Deuteronomy 4:29</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/30-4.htm" title="If any of your be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven, from there will the LORD your God gather you, and from there will he fetch you:...">Deuteronomy 30:4-5</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/26-40.htm" title="If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;...">Leviticus 26:40-42</a>).

"And I asked them concerning the Jews, and concerning Jerusalem." &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; is further defined by &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492;, who had escaped, who were left from the captivity; those who had returned to Judah are intended, as contrasted with those who still remained in heathen, lands. In the answer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, they are more precisely designated as being "there in the province (of Judah)." With respect to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, see remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. They are said to be "in great affliction (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) and in reproach." Their affliction is more nearly defined by the accessory clause which follows: and the wall  equals  because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates burned with fire. &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;, Pual (the intensive form), broken down, does not necessarily mean that the whole wall was destroyed, but only portions, as appears from the subsequent description of the building of the wall, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>.</body></html>
