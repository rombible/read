And when sin is repented of and forsaken, God will forgive it; but the blood of Christ, our Sin-offering, is the only atonement which takes away our guilt. No seeming repentance or amendment will benefit those who reject Him, for self-dependence proves them still unhumbled.

The Promise. The appeal to this promise marks the crisis of the prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>if <span class="ital">ye turn</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">return.</span> The word, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-2.htm" title="And shall return to the LORD your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;">Deuteronomy 30:2</a>, is stronger than to ‘turn’. It denotes a ‘return’ from a wrong road. The back is turned upon the former wrong direction. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-18.htm" title="Then shall you return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked, between him that serves God and him that serves him not.">Malachi 3:18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and keep my commandments, and do them</span>] R.V. omits comma. These words contain the practical explanation of the ‘return.’ No distinction can really be drawn between ‘keeping’ and ‘doing’ the commandments. The words occur together with great frequency in Deuteronomy, both as ‘observe to do’ and ‘observe (or keep) and do.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of the heaven</span>, &c.] R.V. <span class="bld">though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heaven</span>, &c. This and the next clauses are clearly taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-4.htm" title="If any of your be driven out to the outmost parts of heaven, from there will the LORD your God gather you, and from there will he fetch you:">Deuteronomy 30:4</a>, where the same words (except for the use of the 2nd sing. for the 2nd plur.) occur. The term ‘your outcasts’ does not occur with this usage elsewhere in the Pentateuch, while the exact phrase ‘<span class="ital">in</span> the uttermost part of heaven’ also only occurs there. The word ‘outcasts’ may be illustrated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/14-13.htm" title="And the woman said, Why then have you thought such a thing against the people of God? for the king does speak this thing as one which is faulty, in that the king does not fetch home again his banished....">2 Samuel 14:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/16-3.htm" title="Take counsel, execute judgment; make your shadow as the night in the middle of the noonday; hide the outcasts; denude not him that wanders....">Isaiah 16:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt, and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.">Isaiah 27:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD, which gathers the outcasts of Israel said, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered to him.">Isaiah 56:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-17.htm" title="For I will restore health to you, and I will heal you of your wounds, said the LORD; because they called you an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeks after.">Jeremiah 30:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-36.htm" title="And on Elam will I bring the four winds from the four quarters of heaven, and will scatter them toward all those winds; and there shall be no nation where the outcasts of Elam shall not come.">Jeremiah 49:36</a>, and ‘the uttermost part of heaven’ from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm" title="And you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down to the host. Then went he down with Phurah his servant to the outside of the armed men that were in the host.">Jdg 7:11</a>. But the occurrence here side by side of these two forms can only be accounted for on the supposition that Nehemiah has here in his thoughts the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/30-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,...">Deuteronomy 30:1-4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On ‘gathering the outcasts’ compare the title given to the Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-8.htm" title="The Lord GOD, which gathers the outcasts of Israel said, Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are gathered to him.">Isaiah 56:8</a>, ‘The Lord God which gathereth the outcasts of Israel.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and will bring them</span>] The promise to bring together ‘the outcasts’ of Israel should be compared with the metaphor of the shepherd and the scattered sheep, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/34-11.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, will both search my sheep, and seek them out....">Ezekiel 34:11-18</a>.

The words, ‘the place which the Lord thy God shall choose,’ do not occur in the Pentateuch except in the book Deuteronomy, where they are found some 20 times. In five of these passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm" title="Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall you bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to the LORD:">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-6.htm" title="But at the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name in, there you shall sacrifice the passover at even, at the going down of the sun, at the season that you came forth out of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm" title="That you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall bring of your land that the LORD your God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>) the full phrase is found, ‘the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there,’ which Nehemiah here quotes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That ‘the place’ so designated is Jerusalem and the Temple at Jerusalem is beyond all doubt. This was the place of which God had said ‘My name shall be there’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm" title="That your eyes may be open toward this house night and day, even toward the place of which you have said, My name shall be there: that you may listen to the prayer which your servant shall make toward this place.">1 Kings 8:29</a>).

But Shiloh passed away. And though Jerusalem for a time seemed threatened with a like fate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/7-12.htm" title="But go you now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel....">Jeremiah 7:12-15</a>), the day came when the watchmen upon the hills of Ephraim cried, ‘Arise ye and let us go up to Zion unto the Lord our God’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-6.htm" title="For there shall be a day, that the watchmen on the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise you, and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God.">Jeremiah 31:6</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Hebrew verb ‘cause to dwell’ is that from which came the late Hebrew word ‘Shechinah’, applied to the visible manifestation in Glory of the Divine Presence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The association of ‘the Name’ with the Temple is very frequent in Chronicles (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/22-7.htm" title="And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my mind to build an house to the name of the LORD my God:...">1 Chronicles 22:7-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-19.htm" title="Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God; arise therefore, and build you the sanctuary of the LORD God, to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name of the LORD.">1 Chronicles 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-3.htm" title="But God said to me, You shall not build an house for my name, because you have been a man of war, and have shed blood.">1 Chronicles 28:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-16.htm" title="O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you an house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.">1 Chronicles 29:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-1.htm" title="And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.">2 Chronicles 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/2-4.htm" title="Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and for the continual show bread, and for the burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God.

In the answer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-3.htm">Nehemiah 1:3</a>, they are more precisely designated as being "there in the province (of Judah)." With respect to &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492;, see remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-1.htm">Ezra 2:1</a>. They are said to be "in great affliction (&#1512;&#1506;&#1492;) and in reproach." Their affliction is more nearly defined by the accessory clause which follows: and the wall  equals  because the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates burned with fire. &#1502;&#1508;&#1512;&#1510;&#1514;, Pual (the intensive form), broken down, does not necessarily mean that the whole wall was destroyed, but only portions, as appears from the subsequent description of the building of the wall, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3.htm">Nehemiah 3</a>.</body></html>
