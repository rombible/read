For the present it will be convenient to deal only with the materials which St. Luke gives us, reserving a fuller account for the close of the narrative. Nothing is told us here as to his earlier history, prior to his arrival in Samaria. The name indicates Jewish or Samaritan origin. He appears as the type of a class but too common at the time, that of Jews trading on the mysterious <span class= "ital">prestige</span> of their race and the credulity of the heathen, claiming supernatural power exercised through charms and incantations. Such afterwards was Elymas at Cyprus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a>); such were the vagabond Jews exorcists at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>); such was a namesake, Simon of Cyprus (unless, indeed, we have a re-appearance of the same man), who also claimed to be a magician, and who pandered to the vices of Felix, the Procurator of Judæa, by persuading Drusilla (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xx. 7, § 2, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm" title="And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, which was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.">Acts 24:24</a>) to leave her first husband and to marry him. The life of such a man, like that of the Cagliostro fraternity in all ages, was a series of strange adventures, and startling as the statements as to his previous life may seem (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-24.htm" title="Then answered Simon, and said, Pray you to the LORD for me, that none of these things which you have spoken come on me.">Acts 8:24</a>), they are not in themselves incredible. Apollonius of Tyana is, perhaps, the supreme representative of the charlatanism of the period.<p><span class= "bld">Used sorcery.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">was practising magic.</span> On the history of the Greek word <span class= "ital">magos</span> and our “magic,” as derived from it, see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm" title="Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,">Matthew 2:1</a>. Our “sorcerer” comes, through the French <span class= "ital">sorcier, </span>from the Latin <span class= "ital">sortitor, </span>a caster of lots (<span class= "ital">sortes</span>) for the purposes of divination. Later legends enter fully into the various forms of sorcery of which Simon made use.

The cry of the people that he was “the great power of God,” was, we may well believe, the echo of his own boast. He claimed to be, in some undefined way, an Incarnation of Divine Power. The very name had appeared in our Lord’s teaching when He spoke of Himself as sitting on the right hand of “the Power of God,” as an equivalent for the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-69.htm" title="Hereafter shall the Son of man sit on the right hand of the power of God.">Luke 22:69</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:...">Acts 8:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">But there was, </span>&c. — At the time when the gospel was thus brought to them by Philip, a man was there, <span class="ital">called Simon, which before- time in the same city used sorcery </span>— Greek, <span class="ital">had been </span><span class="greekheb">μαγευων</span>, <span class="ital">using magic arts. </span>Some think the expression is entirely of the same signification with the word <span class="greekheb">μαγος</span>, and is intended to tell us, that this Simon was one of the sect of the magi; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm" title="Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem,">Matthew 2:1</a>;) and it is possible he might profess himself of that sect: but certainly the expression here used imports much more, and amounts to the same with <span class="ital">one who used enchantments, </span>pretending, in consequence of them, to exert some supernatural powers; whereas the word <span class="ital">magus, </span>at least about Christ’s time, seems to have signified much the same with our English word <span class="ital">sage, </span>and to have denoted a proficient in learning, and especially in astronomy, and other branches of natural philosophy, to which the Persian magi addicted themselves, and so gave name to many who were far from holding the peculiarities of that sect. Yet as many natural philosophers pretended also to be magicians in the common sense of the word among us, and might make their natural knowledge subservient to that pretence when it was mere imposture, it is not improbable that they generally called themselves magi; and so the verb <span class="greekheb">μαγευων </span>might come to signify the making use of unlawful arts, (as it plainly does here,) while the noun, from whence it was derived, might still retain a more extensive and innocent signification. See Doddridge. <span class="ital">And bewitched the people — </span><span class="greekheb">Εξιστων το εθνος</span>, <span class="ital">astonishing the nation; of Samaria </span>— By his magic arts he showed many signs and lying wonders, which seemed to be miracles, but really were not so; like those of the magicians of Egypt, and those of the man of sin, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a> : <span class="ital">giving out, that himself was some great one </span>— A person possessed of supernatural powers; he wished the people to believe so, and to respect him accordingly. <span class="ital">To whom they all gave heed </span>— Paid great regard, as he desired them to do; <span class="ital">from the least to the greatest — </span>Both young and old, both poor and rich; <span class="ital">saying, This man is the great power of God </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">η δυναμις του Θεου</span>, <span class="greekheb">η μεγαλη</span>, literally, <span class="ital">the power of God, that great power. </span>Thus ignorant, unthinking people mistake what is done by the power of Satan, as if it were done by the power of God; and so with the Gentile world, devils pass for deities, and in the antichristian kingdom, <span class="ital">all the world wonders after the beast, </span>to whom the dragon gives his power, and who opens his mouth in blasphemy against God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/13-2.htm" title="And the beast which I saw was like to a leopard, and his feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great authority....">Revelation 13:2-5</a>.

All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But there was a certain man called Simon - The fathers have written much respecting this man, and have given strange accounts of him; but nothing more is certainly known of him than is stated in this place. Rosenmuller and Kuinoel suppose him to have been a Simon mentioned by Josephus (Antiq., book 20, chapter 7, section 2), who was born in Cyprus. He was a magician, and was employed by Felix to persuade Drusilla to forsake her husband Azizus, and to marry Felix. But it is not very probable that this was the same person. (See the note in Whiston's Josephus.) Simon Magus was probably a "Jew" or a "Samaritan," who had addicted himself to the arts of magic, and who was much celebrated for it. He had studied philosophy in Alexandria in Egypt (Mosheim, vol. i., pp. 113, 114, Murdock's translation), and then lived in Samaria. After he was cut off from the hope of adding to his other powers the power of working miracles, the "fathers" say that he fell into many errors, and became the founder of the sect of the Simonians. They accused him of affirming that he came down as the "Father" in respect to the Samaritans, the "Son" in respect to the Jews, and the "Holy Spirit" in respect to the Gentiles. He did not acknowledge Christ to be the Son of God, but a rival, and pretended himself to be Christ. He rejected the Law of Moses. Many other things are affirmed of him which rest on doubtful authority. He seems to have become an enemy to Christianity, though he was willing "then" to avail himself of some of its doctrines in order to advance his own interests. The account that he came to a tragical death in Rome; that he was honored as a deity by the Roman senate; and that a statue was erected to his memory in the isle of Tiber, is now generally rejected. His end is not known. (See Calmet, art. "Simon Magus," and Mosheim, vol. i., p. 114, note.)<p>Beforetime - The practice of magic, or sorcery, was common at that time, and in all the ancient nations.<p>Used sorcery - Greek: &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  mageuo&#772;n. Exercising the arts of the "Magi," or "magicians"; hence, the name Simon "Magus." See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-1.htm">Matthew 2:1</a>. The ancient "Magi" had their rise in Persia, and were at first addicted to the study of philosophy, astronomy, medicine, etc. This name came afterward to signify those who made use of the knowledge of these arts for the purpose of imposing on mankind - astrologers, soothsayers, necromancers, fortune-tellers, etc. Such persons pretended to predict future events by the positions of the stars, and to cure diseases by incantations, etc. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-6.htm">Isaiah 2:6</a>. See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-20.htm">Daniel 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-2.htm">Daniel 2:2</a>. It was expressly forbidden the Jews to consult such persons on pain of death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-6.htm">Leviticus 20:6</a>. In these arts Simon had been eminently successful.<p>And bewitched - This is an unhappy translation. The Greek means merely that he "astonished" or amazed the people, or "confounded" their judgment. The idea of "bewitching" them is not in the original.<p>Giving out ... - "Saying"; that is, boasting. It was in this way, partly, that he so confounded them. Jugglers generally impose on people just in proportion to the "extravagance" and folly of their pretensions. The same remark may be made of "quack doctors," and of all persons who attempt to delude and impose on people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-13. used sorcery&#8212;magical arts.<p>some great one &#8230; the great power of God&#8212;a sort of incarnation of divinity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Used sorcery; </span> magical enchantments, as a wizard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bewitched the people; </span> caused them, as men in an ecstasy, to be amazed at and afraid of him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Some great one; </span> as if he had been God, or at least had some great favour with him, and had received some extraordinary power from him.

(2) The identity of name cannot, on account of its great prevalence, prove anything, and as little can the assertion that the Samaritans would hardly have deified one of their own countrymen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>).

The magical exercises of the wizards, who at that time very frequently wandered about in the East, extended chiefly to an ostentatious application of their attainments in physical knowledge to juggling conjurings of the dead and demons, to influencing the gods, to sorceries, cures of the sick, soothsayings from the stars, and the like, in which the ideas and formulae of the Oriental-Greek theosophy were turned to display.

Perhaps Simon designedly avoided a more definite self-designation, in order to leave to the praises of the people all the higher scope in the designating of that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>) which he himself wished to pass for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἑαυτόν</span>] He thus acted quite differently from Philip, who preached <span class="ital">Christ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-5.htm" title="Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ to them.">Acts 8:5</a>.

Hilgenfeld and Lipsius may be reckoned amongst those who once refused to admit that Simon Magus was an historical personage, but who afterwards retracted their opinion. But it still remains almost unaccountable that so many critics should have more or less endorsed, or developed, the theory first advocated by Baur that the Simon Magus of the Clementine Homilies is none other than the Apostle Paul. It is sufficient to refer for an exposition of the absurdity of this identification to Dr. Salmon “Clementine Literature” (<span class="ital">Dict. of Christ. Biog.</span>, iii., pp. 575, 576; see also Ritschl’s note, <span class="ital">Die Entstehung der altkatholischen Kirche</span>, p. 228 (second edition)). This ingenuity outdid itself in asking us to see in Simon’s request to buy the power of conferring the Holy Ghost a travesty of the rejection of Paul’s apostolic claims by the older Apostles, in spite of the gift of money which he had collected for the poor Saints in Jerusalem (Overbeck). No wonder that Spitta should describe such an explanation as “a perfect absurdity” (<span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 149). Before we can believe that the author of the Acts would make any use of the pseudo-Clementine literature in his account of Simon, we must account for the extraordinary fact that an author who so prominently represents his hero as triumphing over the powers of magic, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:...">Acts 13:6-12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:...">Acts 19:11-19</a>, should have recourse to a tradition in which this same hero is identified with a magician (see Spitta, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 151; Salmon, “The Simon of Modern Criticism,” <span class="ital">Dict. of Christian Biog.</span>, iv., p. 687; Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 212, and Wendt’s note, p. 201). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-8.htm" title="And the next day we that were of Paul's company departed, and came to Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, which was one of the seven; and stayed with him.">Acts 21:8</a> we read that St. Luke spent several days in the house of Philip the Evangelist, and if we bear in mind that this same Philip is so prominent in chap. 8, there is nothing impossible in the belief that St. Luke should have received his narrative from St. Philip’s lips, and included it in his history as an early and remarkable instance of the triumph of the Gospel—we need not search for anymore occult reason on the part of the historian (see Salmon, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 688). Simon then is an historical personage, and it is not too much to say that to all the stories which have gathered round his name the narrative of Acts always stands in a relation of priority—the two facts mentioned in Acts, that Simon was a magician, and that he came into personal antagonism with St. Peter, always recur elsewhere—but Acts tells us nothing of the details of Simon’s heretical preaching, and it draws the veil entirely over his subsequent history. But “the hero of the romance of heresy” comes into prominence under the name of Simon in Justin Martyr, <span class="ital">Apol.</span>, i., 26, Irenæus, i., 23 (who speaks of Simon the Samaritan, from whom all heresies had their being), and in the Clementine literature. But there is good reason for thinking that St. Irenæus, whilst he gives us a fuller account, is still giving us an account dependent on Justin, and there is every reason to believe that the Clementine writers also followed the same authority; see further, Salmon, “Simon Magus,” <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, 4, p. 681 ff., and for a summary of the legends which gathered round the name of the Samaritan magician Plumptre’s note, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, may be consulted. To the vexed question as to the identification of the Simon of Justin with the Simon of the Acts Dr. Salmon returns a decided negative answer, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 683, and certainly the Simon described by Justin seems to note rather the inheritor and teacher of a Gnostic system already developed than to have been in his own person the father of Gnosticism.

According to Justin Martyr (<span class="ital">Apol</span>. i. 26) he was born at Gitton, a village of Samaria. The history which is given of him after the events mentioned in this chapter describes him as persistently hostile to St Peter and as following that Apostle to Rome to oppose his teaching. But much that is related is of very doubtful authority. He is said to have been deified at Rome, but it seems probable that Justin mistook a tablet, which was discovered in the sixteenth century with an inscription “Semoni Sanco deo fidio” which was erected in honour of the Sabine Hercules, for a record of Divine honours paid to this Simon Magus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which beforetime in the same city used sorcery</span>] There is no word for “same” in the original. The sorcery which Simon, and men like him, used was probably no more than a greater knowledge of some of the facts of chemistry by which they at first attracted attention and then traded on the credulity of those who came to consult them. From the time of their sojourn in Egypt the Jews had known of such impostors, and in their traditional literature some of the “wisdom” of Moses partakes of this character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and bewitched</span> [amazed] <span class="ital">the people of Samaria</span>] The same verb is used (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm" title="Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.">Acts 8:13</a></span>) of the feeling produced in Simon himself by the sight of Philip’s miracles, and is there rendered “wondered.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">giving out that himself was some great one</span>] The general expectation that some great person was to arise among the Jews dictated the form in which impostors would proclaim themselves and aided them in procuring credence for what they said.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀνὴρ</span>, <span class="ital">a man</span>) Such an adversary also Paul found, ch <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a> (Elymas).—<span class="greekheb">προϋπῆρχεν</span>, <span class="ital">was before</span>) Not always is he, who is prior in point of time, entitled to precedency also in claim of right: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm" title="And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.">Acts 8:11</a>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a>. “When he was alone, he was able to find applause; but the coming of the light dispels the darkness.

It has also the meaning of "being out of one's mind," or "beside one's self" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-21.htm">Mark 3:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>), but never that of "bewitching" or "being bewitched." As regards <span class="cmt_word">Simon</span>, commonly surnamed Magus, from his magic arts, it is doubtful whether he is the same Simon as is mentioned by Josephus ('Ant. Jud.,'20. 7:2) as being employed by Felix the Procurator of Judaea, in the reign of Claudius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-25.htm">Acts 23:25</a>), to bewitch Drusfila into forsaking her husband, King Azizus, and marrying him, which she did (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>). The doubt arises from Josephus stating <span class="accented">that</span> Simon to be a Cypriot (<span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>), whereas Justin Martyr says of Simon Magus that he was <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x393;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a native of Gitton, or Githon, a village of Samaria. It has been thought that Gitton may be a mistake of Justin's for Citium, in Cyprus (Farrar's 'Life of St. Paul,' vol. 1. pp. 260, 352; Alford, etc.). The after history of Simon Magus is full of fable. He is spoken of by Irenaeus and other early writers as the inventor or founder of heresy.
