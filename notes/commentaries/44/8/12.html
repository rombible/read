We may infer from the other narrative of Philip’s mission-work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-31.htm" title="And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me? And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him.">Acts 8:31-35</a>) that it also included an outline-history of the passion and death and resurrection of the Prophet whom they had seen among them as fulfilling the great Messianic prophecies.<p><span class= "bld">They were baptized, both men and women.</span>—The tense points, not to one great act, but to the continual succession of converts who were thus admitted.

When they became spectators of Philip’s miracles, and were convinced that they were real, and those of Simon a mere sham; or, when they believed the doctrine that Philip preached, <span class="ital">concerning the kingdom of God, </span>they then saw and felt the real power of God, and submitted thereto; <span class="ital">and were baptized, both men and women </span>— Thus making an open profession of their faith in the gospel.

All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness.

Though they had been carried away so long with this deceiver, and had been so much attached unto him, and held in admiration of him; yet when Philip came and preached Christ unto them, such was the power that attended his ministry, and such the efficacy of divine grace that was exerted, that they not only gave heed unto him, but believed what he said: <p>preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God; concerning the kingdom of the Messiah, the Gospel dispensation, the doctrines and ordinances of the Gospel; and concerning the kingdom of grace, which is spiritual and internal, and which lies not in external things, as meat and drink, but in righteousness, peace, and joy; and concerning the kingdom of glory, the meetness for it, which lies in regenerating grace, and the right unto it, which is the righteousness of Christ: <p>and the name of Jesus Christ; concerning the person of Christ, as the Son of God: and the offices of Christ, as prophet, priest, and King; and the virtue of his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice, for pardon, justification, and atonement: the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read this clause, "in the name of Jesus Christ": and connect it with the following words, <p>they were baptized, both men and women: that is, when, they heard Philip preach the Gospel, and believed in Christ, the sum and substance of it, and made a profession of faith, they were of each sex, both men and women, baptized by immersion, in the name of Jesus Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm" title="But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.">Acts 8:12</a>. <span class="ital">They believed Philip, who announced the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζ</span>. only here (see the critical remarks) with <span class="greekheb">περί</span>, but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm" title="Concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord, which was made of the seed of David according to the flesh;">Romans 1:3</a>; Josephus, <span class="ital">Antt.</span> xv. 7. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Samaritans called the Messiah whom they expected <span class="greekheb">הַשָּׁהֵכ</span> or <span class="greekheb">הַתָּֽהֵב</span>, the Converter, and considered Him as the universal, not merely political, but still more religious and moral, Renewer.
