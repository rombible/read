The character of the “signs” agrees with those that are recorded in the Gospels. The “great cry,” partly, it may be, of agony, partly of exultation at deliverance, agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-26.htm" title="And when the unclean spirit had torn him, and cried with a loud voice, he came out of him.">Mark 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm" title="And in the synagogue there was a man, which had a spirit of an unclean devil, and cried out with a loud voice,">Luke 4:33</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For unclean spirits - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>.<p>Crying with loud voice - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-26.htm">Mark 1:26</a>.<p>Palsies - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. the people with one accord gave heed to &#8230; Philip&#8212;the way being prepared perhaps by the fruits of our Lord's sojourn, as He Himself seems to intimate (see on [1963]Joh 4:31-38).

(see critical notes above), we must suppose that St. Luke passes in thought from the possessed to the unclean spirits by which they were possessed, and so introduces the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐξήρχοντο</span> (as if the unclean spirits were themselves the subject), whereas we should have expected that <span class="greekheb">ἐθεραπεύθησαν</span> would have followed after the first <span class="greekheb">πολλοί</span> as after the second, in the second clause of the verse. Blass conjectures that <span class="greekheb">ἄ</span> should be read before <span class="greekheb">βοῶντα</span>, which thus enables him, while retaining <span class="greekheb">ἐξήρχοντο</span>, to make <span class="greekheb">πολλοί</span> in each clause of the verse the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐθεραπ</span>. One of the most striking phenomena in the demonised was that they lost at least temporarily their own self-consciousness, and became identified with the demon or demons, and this may account for St. Luke’s way of writing, as if he also identified the two in thought, Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, i., 479, 647, ff. As a physician St. Luke must have often come into contact with those who had unclean spirits, and he would naturally have studied closely the nature of their disease. It is also to be noted that <span class="greekheb">πολλοί</span> with the genitive, <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἐχόντων</span> (not <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἔχοντες</span>), shows that not all the possessed were healed, and if so, it is an indication of the truthfulness of the narrative. Moreover, St. Luke not only shows himself acquainted with the characteristics of demoniacal possession, <span class="ital">cf.</span> his description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm" title="And when he went forth to land, there met him out of the city a certain man, which had devils long time, and ware no clothes, neither stayed in any house, but in the tombs.">Luke 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-38.htm" title="And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech you, look on my son: for he is my only child....">Luke 9:38-39</a>, but he constantly, as in the passage before us, distinguishes it from disease itself, and that more frequently than the other Evangelists. Hobart draws special attention to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm" title="And he came down with them, and stood in the plain, and the company of his disciples, and a great multitude of people out of all Judaea and Jerusalem, and from the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, which came to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases;">Luke 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-4.htm" title="And when much people were gathered together, and were come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:">Luke 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-32.htm" title="And he said to them, Go you, and tell that fox, Behold, I cast out devils, and I do cures to day and to morrow, and the third day I shall be perfected.">Luke 13:32</a>, which have no parallels in the other Gospels, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.

Dr. Plummer, <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, Introd., 65, points out that Aristotle, a physician’s son, has also this use of <span class="greekheb">παραλελυμένος</span> (<span class="ital">Eth. Nic.</span>, i., 13, 15), but he adds that its use in St. Luke may have come from the LXX, as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-12.htm" title="Why lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees;">Hebrews 12:12</a></span>, where we have the word in a quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-3.htm" title="Strengthen you the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.">Isaiah 35:3</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-23.htm" title="A wicked woman abateth the courage, maketh an heavy countenance and a wounded heart: a woman that will not comfort her husband in distress maketh weak hands and feeble knees.">Sir 25:23</a>). It may be added that the participle is also found in 3Ma 2:22, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῖς μέλεσι παραλελυμένον</span>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-15.htm" title="Who discomfited the right wing, and pursued them unto the mount Azotus.">1Ma 9:15</a>, where it is said of Alcimus, <span class="greekheb">καὶ παρελύθη</span>. But the most remarkable feature in St. Luke’s employment of the word is surely this, that in parallel passages in which St. Matthew and St. Mark have <span class="greekheb">παραλυτικός</span> he has <span class="greekheb">παραλελυμένος</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-18.htm" title="And, behold, men brought in a bed a man which was taken with a palsy: and they sought means to bring him in, and to lay him before him.">Luke 5:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm" title="And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy, lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said to the sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; your sins be forgiven you.">Matthew 9:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-3.htm" title="And they come to him, bringing one sick of the palsy, which was borne of four.">Mark 2:3</a>; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-24.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,) I say to you, Arise, and take up your couch, and go into your house.">Luke 5:24</a> this same distinction is also found in the Revisers’ text (but see W.H[216] above), when this verse is compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-6.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.">Matthew 9:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-10.htm" title="But that you may know that the Son of man has power on earth to forgive sins, (he said to the sick of the palsy,)">Mark 2:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[215] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[216] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them</span>] There are some variations in the Gk.
