This is the only passage in the New Testament in which it is used figuratively. “Bitterness” meets us, as expressing extreme moral depravity, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm" title="Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness:">Romans 3:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm" title="Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamor, and evil speaking, be put away from you, with all malice:">Ephesians 4:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The latter phrase implies that the iniquity of Simon bound him as with the iron chains of a habit from which he could not free himself.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I perceive - That is, by the act which he had done. His offer had shown a state of mind that was wholly inconsistent with true religion. One single sin "may" as certainly show that there is no true piety as many acts of iniquity. It may be so decided, so malignant, so utterly inconsistent with just views as at once to determine what the character is. The sin of Simon was of this character. Peter here does not appear to have claimed the power of judging the "heart"; but he judged, as all other people would, by the act.<p>In the gall - This word denotes properly "bile," or "that bitter, yellowish-green fluid that is secreted in the liver." Hence, it means anything very bitter; and also any bad passion of the mind, as anger, malice, etc. We speak of "bitterness" of mind, etc.<p>Of bitterness - This is a Hebraism; the usual mode of expressing the "superlative," and means "excessive bitterness." The phrase is used respecting idolatry <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, "Lest there should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood." A similar expression occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15</a>, "Lest any root of bitterness springing up, trouble you." "Sin" is thus represented as a "bitter" or poisonous thing; a tiring not only "unpleasant" in its consequences, but ruinous in its character, as a poisonous plant would be in the midst of other plants, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-19.htm">Jeremiah 2:19</a>, "It is an evil and bitter thing that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-18.htm">Jeremiah 4:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-14.htm">Romans 3:14</a>, "Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a>. The meaning here is, that the heart of Simon was full of dreadful, malignant sin.<p>Bond of iniquity - Or, that thou art "bound by" iniquity. That is, that it has the rule over you, and "binds" you as a captive. Sin is often thus represented as "bondage" and "captivity," <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/5-22.htm">Proverbs 5:22</a>, "He shall be holden with the cords of his sins"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23-24</a>.

(On the word <span class="greekheb">χολή</span> its sense here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-34.htm" title="They gave him vinegar to drink mingled with gall: and when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.">Matthew 27:34</a>, see Meyer-Weiss, <span class="ital">Matth.</span>, p. 546.) The preposition <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> is generally taken as = <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> in this passage; but Rendall suggests that here, as is sometimes elsewhere, it = <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, and he therefore renders: “I see that thou art as gall of bitterness,” denoting the evil function which Simon would fulfil in the Church if he continued what he was. Westcott’s note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a> should also be consulted.—<span class="greekheb">σύνδεσμον ἀδικίας</span>: R.V. translates “thou art … in the bond of iniquity”. But if the passage means that Simon “will become … a bond of iniquity,” R.V., margin, or that he is now <span class="ital">as</span> a bond of iniquity (Rendall), the expression denotes, not that Simon is bound, but that he binds others in iniquity. Blass refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm" title="Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where a similar phrase occurs, <span class="greekheb">σύνδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀδικ</span>., and explains: “improbitate quasi vinctus es”; so Grimm, while pointing out that the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm" title="Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?">Isaiah 58:6</a> is used in a different sense from here, explains “vinculum improbitatis, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, quod ab improbitate nectitur ad constringendos animos”. Others again take the expression to denote a <span class="ital">bundle, fasciculus</span> (Wetstein) (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Hdian., iv., 12, 11), Simon being regarded “quasi ex improbitate concretum,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> especially Cicero, <span class="ital">in Pison.</span>, ix., 21; but such a rendering is rejected by Grimm, as no examples can be adduced of this tropical use of the noun, and by Wendt, on the ground that <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span> is not in the plural, but in the singular. Combinations with <span class="greekheb">ἀδικία</span> are characteristic of St. Luke; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-27.htm" title="But he shall say, I tell you, I know you not from where you are; depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.">Luke 13:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/16-8.htm" title="And the lord commended the unjust steward, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world are in their generation wiser than the children of light....">Luke 16:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-6.htm" title="And the Lord said, Hear what the unjust judge said.">Luke 18:6</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-18.htm" title="Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the middle, and all his bowels gushed out.">Acts 1:18</a>; the word only occurs once elsewhere in the Gospels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-18.htm" title="He that speaks of himself seeks his own glory: but he that seeks his glory that sent him, the same is true, and no unrighteousness is in him.">John 7:18</a>; Friedrich, <span class="ital">Das Lucasevangelium</span>, p. 23.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity</span>] The preposition <span class="ital">in</span> makes a great difficulty in this verse. The word in the original means <span class="ital">into</span> or <span class="ital">for</span>. The construction has been compared with that of the Hebrew preposition <span class="greekheb">ל</span> = <span class="ital">for</span> after the verb “to be” in passages such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-22.htm" title="And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided into two kingdoms any more at all.">Ezekiel 37:22</a>, “I will make them one nation,” literally, “<span class="ital">unto</span> one nation.” But instances of this construction are not common enough in the O.T. for an imitation of it in the N. T. to be probable. It seems better therefore not to take “gall of bitterness” and “bond of iniquity” as thus in apposition with the subject of the sentence, but rather to regard the preposition as used with the sense of motion towards a place or state and subsequent rest there. So it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-7.htm" title="And he from within shall answer and say, Trouble me not: the door is now shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot rise and give you.">Luke 11:7</a>, “My children are with me in (<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>) bed,” where the meaning is “They have come into and are remaining in bed.” For the expression “gall of bitterness,” cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, where those who serve false gods are spoken of as “a root that beareth gall and wormwood.” See also the “root of bitterness,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm" title="Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled;">Hebrews 12:15</a>. The second expression is found as “bands of wickedness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm" title="Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?">Isaiah 58:6</a>). The whole sentence would thus imply that Simon had gone from one evil to another till he had reached and was remaining in a stage which deserved the reprobation spoken against idolatry in the O.T., and had allowed evil to make him its prisoner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/8.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς</span>, <span class="ital">in</span>) [<span class="ital">in the light of, as one who is the gall</span>, etc.: not as Engl.

The context there also shows conclusively that the "gall and bitterness" ("wormwood," A.V.) of which Moses speaks is the spirit of idolatry or defection from God springing up in some professing member of the Church, and defiling and corrupting others, as it is expounded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-15.htm">Hebrews 12:15, 16</a>. This, as St. Peter saw, was exactly the case with Simon, whose heart was not straight with God, but "had turned away from him," as it is said in Deuteronomy. Though baptized, he was still an idolater in heart, and likely to trouble many. "The gall of bitterness" is the same as "gall and wormwood," or "bitterness." "Gall," or "bile," is in classical Greek and other languages a synonym for "bitterness," especially in a figurative sense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-15.htm">Lamentations 3:15, 19</a> - <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;</span>, LXX.). The uncommon phrase, the bond of iniquity, seems to be borrowed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-6.htm">Isaiah 58:6</a>, where the LXX. have the same words, <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f70;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "loose the bands of wickedness," A.V. Simon was still bound in these bands. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/8.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In the gall (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., into.

It is used of the bond of Christian peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-3.htm">Ephesians 4:3</a>); of the close compacting of the church represented as a body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm">Colossians 2:19</a>); and of love as the bond of perfectness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-14.htm">Colossians 3:14</a> :).
