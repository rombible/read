It is probable enough that he was impressed by the signs that Philip wrought; that he felt himself in the presence of a Power above his own; that he accepted Philip’s statements as to the death and resurrection of the Christ. It was such a faith as that of which St. James speaks (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>). If we are to use the definite language of theological science, it would be true to say that he had the <span class= "ital">fides informis, </span>faith not preceded by repentance and not perfected by love. And baptism, in such a case, the expressed or implied conditions being absent, brought with it no new birth to a higher life. He remained still “in the gall of bitterness and the bond of iniquity” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-23.htm" title="For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.">Acts 8:23</a>). But even for him it bore its witness of the readiness of God to forgive and to regenerate. The subsequent fulfilment of the conditions which were then absent would have quickened the potential into an actual grace, and no second baptism would have been needed to supplement the shortcomings of the first. Peter calls on him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-22.htm" title="Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God, if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you.">Acts 8:22</a>) to repent and pray for forgiveness. He does not tell him that he must be baptised again.<p><span class= "bld">And wondered.</span>—The verb is the same as that rendered “bewitched” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm" title="And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries.">Acts 8:11</a>. The tables were turned. The magician yielded to a spell mightier than his own, and was, in his turn, as one beside himself with amazement. The difference between Simon and the believing Samaritans is, in this matter, suggestive. His faith rested on outward miracles. With them the miracles did but serve to confirm a faith which rested on the “prophetic word” as spoken by the Son of Man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-42.htm" title="And said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of your saying: for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world.">John 4:42</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:5-13 As far as the gospel prevails, evil spirits are dislodged, particularly unclean spirits. All inclinations to the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul are such. Distempers are here named, the most difficult to be cured by the course of nature, and most expressive of the disease of sin. Pride, ambition, and desire after grandeur have always caused abundance of mischief, both to the world and to the church. The people said of Simon, This man is the great power of God. See how ignorant and thoughtless people mistake. But how strong is the power of Divine grace, by which they were brought to Christ, who is Truth itself! The people not only gave heed to what Philip said, but were fully convinced that it was of God, and not of men, and gave up themselves to be directed thereby. Even bad men, and those whose hearts still go after covetousness, may come before God as his people come, and for a time continue with them. And many wonder at the proofs of Divine truths, who never experience their power. The gospel preached may have a common operation upon a soul, where it never produced inward holiness. All are not savingly converted who profess to believe the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Simon himself believed also - That is, he believed that Jesus had performed miracles, and was raised from the dead, etc. All this he could believe in entire consistency with his own notions of the power of magic; and all that the connection requires us to suppose is that he believed this Jesus had the power of working miracles; and as he purposed to turn this to his own account, he was willing to profess himself to be his follower. It might have injured his popularity, moreover, if he had taken a stand in opposition when so many were professing to become Christians. People often profess religion because, if they do not, they fear that they will lose their influence, and be left with the ungodly. That Simon was not a real Christian is apparent from the whole narrative, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-18.htm">Acts 8:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-21.htm">Acts 8:21-23</a>.<p>And when he was baptized - He was admitted to a "profession" of religion in the same way as others. Philip did not pretend to know the heart; and Simon was admitted because he "professed" his belief. This is all the evidence that ministers of the gospel can now have, and it is no wonder that they, as well Philip, are often deceived. The reasons which influenced Simon to make a profession of religion seem to have been these:<p>(1) An impression that Christianity was "true." He seems to have been convinced of this by the miracles of Philip.<p>(2) the fact that many others were becoming Christians; and "he" went in with the multitude. This is often the case in revivals of religion.<p>(3) he was willing to make use of Christianity to advance his own power, influence, and popularity - a thing which multitudes of men of the same mind with Simon Magus have been willing since to do.<p>He continued ... - It was customary and natural for the disciples to remain with their teachers. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>.<p>And wondered - This is the same word that is translated "bewitched" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm">Acts 8:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-11.htm">Acts 8:11</a>. It means that he was amazed that Philip could "really" perform so much greater miracles than "he" had even pretended to. Hypocrites will sometimes be greatly attentive to the external duties of religion, and will be greatly surprised at what is done by God for the salvation of sinners.<p>Miracles and signs - Greek: signs and great powers, or great miracles. That is, so much greater than he pretended to be able to perform. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

Entirely at variance with the text is the opinion (Grotius, Clericus, Rosenmüller, Kuinoel) that Simon regarded Jesus only as a great magician and worker of miracles, and not as the Messiah, and only to this extent believed on Him. He was, by the preaching and miracles of Philip, actually moved to faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Yet this faith of his was only historical and intellectual, without having as its result a change of the inner life;[222] hence he was soon afterwards capable of what is related in vv.18, 19.

There is apparently a distinction intended by St Luke between the belief of the Samaritans and that of Simon.
