Further details are given by St. Paul himself. He “persecuted this way unto the death” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>). It does not follow, however, that this points to more than the death of Stephen. Both men and women were imprisoned (<span class= "ital">ibid</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The fact that the latter class were included among the sufferers, implies that they had been more or less prominent in the activity of the new society. Such may have been the devout women of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2-3</a>. The victims were punished in every synagogue, most probably with the forty stripes save one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one.">2Corinthians 11:24</a>) which was the common penalty for minor offences against religious order. They were compelled to blaspheme the “worthy name” of the Master whom they owned as the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm" title="And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.">Acts 26:11</a>; Jas. Ii. 7). They were subject to wanton outrages in addition to judicial severity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.">1Timothy 1:13</a>). There was, as the persecutor himself afterwards confessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm" title="And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to strange cities.">Acts 26:11</a>), a kind of insane ferocity in his violence. Even the very word “haling” implies a brutality which might well have been spared.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">As for Saul </span>— Who was one of the main instruments in this persecution; <span class="ital">he made havoc of the church </span>— Like some furious beast of prey. So the Greek word properly signifies. He did his utmost to ruin it, not caring what mischief he did to the disciples of Christ, and setting no bounds to his rage and cruelty: <span class="ital">entering into every house </span>— Where the Christians used to assemble for the worship of God; or every house that had, or was thought to have, any Christians in it; <span class="ital">haling men and women</span> — Dragging them along the streets, without any regard to age or sex; <span class="ital">committed them to prison </span>— For no crime, real or pretended, but that of having believed in Jesus, and embraced the gospel. <span class="ital">Therefore they that were </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">οι μεν ουν διασπαρεντες</span>, <span class="ital">they, therefore, being scattered abroad, went everywhere </span>— Went through Judea and Samaria, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm" title="And Saul was consenting to his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.">Acts 8:1</a>,) <span class="ital">preaching the word </span>— Wherever they came; scattering the knowledge of Christ and his gospel wherever they were scattered: they went, <span class="greekheb">ευαγγελιζομενοι τον λογον</span>, <span class="ital">evangelizing, </span>or, <span class="ital">declaring the glad tidings of the word </span>— Those of them that had ability to preach, in their preaching, and others in their common converse. And in many places they were remarkably successful. So that God overruled the cruelty and rage of his people’s enemies to subserve his own wise and gracious purposes. There is no room to inquire where these poor refugees had their orders. Some of them were endowed with miraculous gifts: and, if none of them had been so, the extraordinary call they had to spread the knowledge of Christ wherever they came, among those who were ignorant of him, abundantly justified them in what they did. They were now in a country where many of them were no strangers, for Christ and his disciples had conversed much in the regions of Judea and Samaria, so that a foundation had been laid for them to build upon, and it was requisite to let the people in those parts know what had been the issue of the preaching Christ’s doctrine, and that it was not now left neglected and forgotten, as perhaps they had been made to believe.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:1-4 Though persecution must not drive us from our work, yet it may send us to work elsewhere. Wherever the established believer is driven, he carries the knowledge of the gospel, and makes known the preciousness of Christ in every place. Where a simple desire of doing good influences the heart, it will be found impossible to shut a man out from all opportunities of usefulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As for Saul - But Saul. He took no interest or part in the pious attentions shown to Stephen, but engaged with zeal in the work of persecution.<p>He made havoc - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;  elumaineto. This word is commonly applied to wild beasts, to lions, wolves, etc., and denotes the "devastations" which they commit. Saul raged against the church like a wild beast - a strong expression, denoting the zeal and fury with which he engaged in persecution.<p>Entering into every house - To search for those who were suspected of being Christians.<p>Haling - Dragging, or compelling them.<p>Committed them to prison - The Sanhedrin had no power to put them to death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm">John 18:31</a>. But they had power to imprison; and they resolved, it seems, to exercise this power to the utmost. Paul frequently refers to his zeal in persecuting the church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm">Acts 26:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-13.htm">Galatians 1:13</a>. It may be remarked here that there never was a persecution commenced with more flattering prospects to the persecutors. Saul, the principal agent, was young, zealous, learned, and clothed with power. He showed afterward that he had talents suited for any station, and zeal that tired with no exertion, and that was appalled by no obstacle. With this talent and this zeal he entered on his work. The Christians were few and feeble. They were scattered and unarmed. They were unprotected by any civil power, and exposed, therefore, to the full blaze and rage of persecution. That the church was not destroyed was owing to the protection of God a protection which not only secured its existence, but which extended its influence and power by means of this very persecution far abroad on the earth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Canon Farrar observes: "The part which he played at this time in the horrid work of persecution has, I fear, been always underrated. It is only when we collect the separate passages - they are no less than eight in number - in which allusion is made to this sad period, it is only when we weigh the terrible significance of the expressions used that we feel the load of remorse which must have lain upon him, and the taunts to which he was liable from malignant enemies" ("Life and Work of St. Paul"). Note the imperfect, of continued action. </body></html>
