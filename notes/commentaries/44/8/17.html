(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm" title="Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.">Acts 6:6</a>.) Historically, the act here recorded has the interest of being the starting-point of what afterwards developed into the rite known as Confirmation. Taking the narrative of the Acts by itself, a question might be raised how far what we read of was normal or exceptional, connected, for a time only, with the bestowal of new and marvellous powers, or powerful, through the whole history of the Church, as a means of grace strengthening the spiritual life after those powers had been withdrawn. In any case it was probable that no hard and fast line marked the disappearance of the special and marvellous forms of spiritual power which were at first manifested in connection with the laying-on of hands, and so the practice had time to become part of the fixed order of the Church. When they ceased altogether we can understand the reluctance of men to give up a rite that had come down from the days of the Apostles. They would feel that the prayer of faith was still mighty to prevail; that the Spirit would still be given in answer to prayer joined with the symbolic act, though no longer in the same form, and would confirm and strengthen the work which had been begun in baptism, and so the primitive laying-on of hands passed into Confirmation, and was accompanied by other symbolic acts, such as anointing. The thought that it is so called because in it adults <span class= "ital">confirm</span> the promises made for them when baptised as infants, is entirely modern, and cannot be traced further back than the sixteenth century.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:14-25 The Holy Ghost was as yet fallen upon none of these coverts, in the extraordinary powers conveyed by the descent of the Spirit upon the day of Pentecost. We may take encouragement from this example, in praying to God to give the renewing graces of the Holy Ghost to all for whose spiritual welfare we are concerned; for that includes all blessings. No man can give the Holy Spirit by the laying on of his hands; but we should use our best endeavours to instruct those for whom we pray. Simon Magus was ambitious to have the honour of an apostle, but cared not at all to have the spirit and disposition of a Christian. He was more desirous to gain honour to himself, than to do good to others. Peter shows him his crime. He esteemed the wealth of this world, as if it would answer for things relating to the other life, and would purchase the pardon of sin, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. This was such a condemning error as could by no means consist with a state of grace. Our hearts are what they are in the sight of God, who cannot be deceived. And if they are not right in his sight, our religion is vain, and will stand us in no stead. A proud and covetous heart cannot be right with God. It is possible for a man to continue under the power of sin, yet to put on a form of godliness. When tempted with money to do evil, see what a perishing thing money is, and scorn it. Think not that Christianity is a trade to live by in this world. There is much wickedness in the thought of the heart, its false notions, and corrupt affections, and wicked projects, which must be repented of, or we are undone. But it shall be forgiven, upon our repentance. The doubt here is of the sincerity of Simon's repentance, not of his pardon, if his repentance was sincere. Grant us, Lord, another sort of faith than that which made Simon wonder only, and did not sanctify his heart. May we abhor all thoughts of making religion serve the purposes of pride or ambition. And keep us from that subtle poison of spiritual pride, which seeks glory to itself even from humility. May we seek only the honour which cometh from God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then laid they their hands ... - This was an act of "prayer," expressing an invocation to God that he would impart the blessing to "them." On "how many" they laid their hands is not said. It is evident that it was not on "all," for they did not thus lay hands on Simon. Perhaps it was done on a few of the more prominent and leading persons, who were to be employed particularly in bearing witness to the truth of the gospel. It was customary to lay the hands on any person when a "favor" was to be conferred or a blessing imparted.

(For only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus)&#8212;As the baptism of adults presupposed "the renewing of the Holy Ghost" (Tit 3:5-7; 1Co 12:13), of which the profession of faith had to be taken for evidence, this communication of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of the apostles' hands was clearly a superadded thing; and as it was only occasional, so it was invariably attended with miraculous manifestations (see Ac 10:44, where it followed Peter's preaching; and Ac 19:1-7, where, as here, it followed the laying on of hands). In the present case an important object was served by it&#8212;"the sudden appearance of a body of baptized disciples in Samaria, by the agency of one who was not an apostle, requiring the presence and power of apostles to perform their special part as the divinely appointed founders of the Church" [Alford].

The Ethiopic version adds, "who had been baptized"; but not upon all of them, men and women, only on some they were directed unto by the Spirit of God; whom he had designed, and now would qualify for the work of the ministry, that so this new church, might be supplied with proper officers, pastors, and teachers, to feed them with knowledge and with understanding, and who might not only have ministerial gifts to qualify them for preaching the Gospel, but extraordinary ones, which would serve for the confirmation of it; and for this purpose the apostles, "both" of them, as the Arabic version reads, laid their hands on them: for it will not seem probable, that they laid their hands upon the women, on such an account; and it will hardly be received, that they should lay their hands on Simon Magus, otherwise he would have received the Holy Ghost too; so that it seems a plain case, that imposition of hands was not used to them all: <p>and they received the Holy Ghost; that is, they received the gifts of the Holy Ghost; so that they could prophesy and speak with tongues, and heal diseases, and do other wonderful works: and since now these effects have ceased, the rite and ceremony which was peculiar to the apostles as such, it should seem should cease likewise. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/8.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-17.htm" title="Then laid they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.">Acts 8:17</a>. There cannot be any reason to doubt the validity of St. Philip’s baptism, and it is therefore evident that the laying on of hands (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>) is here distinct from baptism, and also from the appointment to any Church office (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-6.htm" title="Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.">Acts 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>), or the bestowal of any special power of healing as in the person of Ananias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-12.htm" title="And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.">Acts 9:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>, although gifts of healing might no doubt accompany it. But both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a>) it follows closely upon baptism, and is performed by Apostles, to whom alone the function belongs, although it is reasonable to suppose that the prophets and teachers who were associated with them in their Apostolic office, and who could lay on hands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul....">Acts 13:1-3</a>, could do so in other cases also for the reception of the Holy Ghost (Gore, <span class="ital">Church and the Ministry</span>, p. 258). The question why St. Philip did not himself “lay hands” upon his converts has been variously discussed, but the narrative of Acts supplies the answer, inasmuch as in the only two parallel cases, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the verse before us and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>, the higher officers alone exercise this power, and also justifies the usual custom of the Church in so limiting its exercise (“Confirmation,” <span class="ital">Dict. of Christian Antiq.</span> (Smith & Cheetham), i., p. 425; B.D.1, iii., <span class="ital">App.</span>; and Hooker, <span class="ital">Eccles. Pol.</span>, v., ch. lxvi. 5, and passage cited; Jerome, <span class="ital">Advers. Lucif., c.</span> 4, and St. Cyprian, <span class="ital">Epis.</span> 73, <span class="ital">ad Jubaianum</span> (reference to the passage before us)). Undoubtedly there are cases of baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there.

For the special case of Cornelius see below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>, see further “Confirmation,” B.D.2, i., 640]. Weizsâcker contrasts this account in 8., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-16.htm" title="There came also a multitude out of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.">Acts 5:16</a>, which he describes as this crude conception of the communication of the Spirit solely by the imposition of the Apostles’ hands (<span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, ii., 254 and 299, E.T.), and which represents baptism as being thus completed, with the account of baptism given us by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;...">1 Corinthians 1:14-17</a>. But in the first place we should remember that Acts does not describe <span class="ital">baptism</span> as being completed by the laying on of hands; the baptism was not invalid, the Samaritan converts became by its administration members of the Church; and the laying on of hands was not so much a completion of baptism as an addition to it. And, in the next place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-2.htm" title="Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.">Hebrews 6:2</a> certainly indicates that this addition must have been known at a very early period (see Westcott, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). It may also be borne in mind that <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-21.htm" title="Now he which establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us, is God;">2 Corinthians 1:21</a> is interpreted of confirmation by many of the Fathers (<span class="ital">cf.</span> too Westcott’s interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-20.htm" title="But you have an unction from the Holy One, and you know all things.">1 John 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-27.htm" title="But the anointing which you have received of him stays in you, and you need not that any man teach you: but as the same anointing teaches you of all things, and is truth, and is no lie, and even as it has taught you, you shall abide in him.">1 John 2:27</a>), and that St. Paul is writing a letter and not describing a ritual.—<span class="greekheb">ἐλάμβανον</span>: Dr. Hort, who holds that the reception of the Holy Spirit is here explained as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a> by reference to the manifestation of the gift of tongues, etc., points out that the verb is not <span class="greekheb">ἔλαβον</span>, but imperfect <span class="greekheb">ἐλάμβανον</span>, and he therefore renders it “showed a succession of signs of the Spirit” (sec also above). But this interpretation need not conflict with the belief in the gift of the Spirit as a permanent possession, and it is well to remember that <span class="greekheb">ἐπετίθεσαν</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἐπετίθουν</span>) is also imperfect. Both verbs may therefore simply indicate the continuous administration of the laying on of hands by the Apostles, and the continuous supernatural result (not necessarily external manifestation) which followed upon this action; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐβαπτίζοντο</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-12.htm" title="But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.">Acts 8:12</a>, imperfect, and so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm" title="And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.">Acts 18:8</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. <span class="ital">Then laid they their hands on them</span>] That there might be some outward sign of this imparted grace.

But on Cornelius and his companions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>) the same gift was bestowed while Peter spake unto them.</body></html>
