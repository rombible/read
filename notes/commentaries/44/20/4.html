As they were to go with him to Jerusalem, it was indeed natural they should have gone to the city from which he intended to embark. It is not difficult to discover the reason of their accompanying him. He was carrying up a large sum in trust for the churches of Judæa, and he sought to avoid even the suspicion of the malversations which the tongue of slanderers was so ready to impute to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-20.htm" title="Avoiding this, that no man should blame us in this abundance which is administered by us:">2Corinthians 8:20-21</a>). Representatives were accordingly chosen from the leading churches, who acting, as it were, as auditors of his accounts, would be witnesses that all was right. As regards the individual names, we note as follows: (1) The name of Sopater, or Sosipater, occurs in the inscription on the arch named in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-8.htm" title="And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.">Acts 17:8</a> as belonging to one of the <span class= "ital">politarchs</span> of Thessalonica. (2) Aristarchus had been a fellow-worker with St. Paul at Ephesus, and had been a sufferer in the tumult raised by Demetrius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>). (3) Of Secundus nothing is known, but the name may be compared with Tertius in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>, and Quartus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm" title="Gaius my host, and of the whole church, salutes you. Erastus the chamberlain of the city salutes you, and Quartus a brother.">Romans 16:23</a>, as suggesting the probability that all three were sons of a disciple who had adopted this plan of naming his children. The corresponding name of Primus occurs in an inscription from the Catacombs now in the Lateran Museum, as belonging to an exorcist, and might seem, at first, to supply the missing link; but the inscription is probably of later date. In any case, it is a probable inference that the three belonged to the freed-man or slave class, who had no family names; and the Latin form of their names suggests that they had been originally Roman Jews, an inference confirmed by the fact that both Tertius and Quartus send salutations to their brethren in the imperial city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22-23</a>). The names Primitivus and Primitiva, which occur both in Christian and Jewish inscriptions in the same Museum, are more or less analogous. (4) Gains of Derbe. The Greek sentence admits of the description being attached to the name of Timotheus which follows; and the fact that a Caius has already appeared in close connection with Aristarchus makes this construction preferable. On this assumption he, too, came from Thessalonica. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm" title="And the whole city was filled with confusion: and having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.">Acts 19:29</a>.) (5) Timotheus. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm" title="Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek:">Acts 16:1</a>.) (6) Tychicus. The name, which means “fortunate,” the Greek equivalent for Felix, was very common among slaves and freed-men. It is found in an inscription in the Lateran Museum from the Cemetery of Priscilla; and in a non-Christian inscription, giving the names of the household of the Emperor Claudius, in the Vatican Museum, as belonging to an architect. The Tychicus of the Acts would seem to have been a disciple from Ephesus, where men of that calling would naturally find an opening. Such vocations tended naturally, as has been said in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>, to become hereditary. (7) Trophimus (= “nursling,” or “foster-child” was, again, a name of the same class, almost as common as Onesimus ( = “profitable”). In a very cursory survey of inscriptions from the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> and Catacombs of Rome, I have noted the recurrence of the former four, and of the latter five times Trophimus appears again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>, and is described more definitely as an Ephesian. We find him again in contact with St. Paul towards the close of the Apostle’s life, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2Timothy 4:20</a>. That they were seven in number suggests the idea of a reproduction either of the idea of the Seven, who are commonly called Deacons in Acts 6, or of the Roman institution upon which that was probably based. It may be noted here, in addition to what has there been said on the subject, that the well-known pyramidal monument of Caius Cestius, of the time of Augustus, near the Porta Latina at Rome, records that he was one of the <span class= "ital">Septemviri Epulonum</span> there referred to.<p>We must not forget what the sudden change to the first person plural in the next verse reminds us of, that the name of Luke has to be added to the list of St. Paul’s companions. We may, perhaps, assume that he went less as an official delegate from the Church of Philippi than as a friend, and probably, St. Paul’s health needing his services, as physician.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus....">Acts 20:4-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea, </span>&c. — The several persons mentioned in this verse are thought by some to have been joined with Paul as <span class="ital">messengers of the churches, </span>in carrying their contributions to the poor brethren at Jerusalem.

Some think this mention of his father was to distinguish him from Sosipater (the same name in fuller form), mentioned in Ro 16:21. But that they were the same person seems more probable.<p>of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus&#8212;(See on [2071]Ac 19:29).<p>and Secundus&#8212;of whom nothing else is known.<p>Gaius of Derbe&#8212;Though the Gaius of Ac 19:29 is said to be of "Macedonia," and this one "of Derbe," there is no sufficient reason for supposing them different persons; on the contrary, Ro 16:23 (compare with 3Jo 1, where there is hardly any reason to doubt that the same Gaius is addressed) seems to show that though he spent an important part of his Christian life away from his native Derbe, he had latterly retired to some place not very far from it.<p>and Timotheus&#8212;not probably of Derbe, as one might suppose from this verse, but of Lystra (see on [2072]Ac 16:1); both being so associated in his early connection with the apostle that the mention of the one in the previous clause would recall the other on the mention of his name.<p>and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus&#8212;The latter was an Ephesian, and probably the former also. They seem to have put themselves, from this time forward, at the apostle's disposal, and to the very last been a great comfort to him (Eph 6:21, 22; Col 4:7, 8; Ac 21:29; 2Ti 4:12, 20). From the mention of the places to which each of these companions belonged, and still more the order in which they occur, we are left to conclude that they were deputies from their respective churches, charged with taking up and bringing on the collection for the poor saints at Jerusalem, first at Berea, next at Thessalonica, then at Philippi [Howson], where we gather that our historian himself rejoined the party (from the resumption at Ac 20:5 of the "us," dropped at Ac 16:17), by whom the Philippian collection would naturally be brought on.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There accompanied him into Asia; </span> their names are set down, as being men called and known at that time in the churches, and that what they did for this holy apostle might be remembered in all ages. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sopater; </span> who is called also <span class="ital">Sosipater, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21</a></span>.

This Sopater is thought to be the same with Sosipater in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a> and in three of Beza's copies, and in as many of Stephens's, he is so called here; the Ethiopic version calls him Peter, a citizen of Berea; and the Arabic version Sopater of Aleppo. The Alexandrian copy, Beza's most ancient copy, and others, the Complutensian edition, and the Vulgate Latin version, read, Sopater of Pyrrhus, the Berean; that is, the son of Pyrrhus. He is reckoned among the seventy disciples, and is said to be bishop of Iconium;  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>. This name was common among the Greeks; there was one of this name a native of Paphus, in the times of Alexander the great, a comical poet, and who also is sometimes called Sosipater, as this man was; there was another Sopater the sophist, who wrote the affairs of Alexander; and there was another of this name, who, among other things, collected much concerning painters and statuaries. The name signifies "a father saved". Pyrrhus is a Grecian name well known, being the name of a famous king of Greece who engaged in war with the Romans. This man went along with the apostle into Asia; and it seems, that of the persons here mentioned, he only accompanied him; for the verb is in the singular number, and the other six persons following did not go along with him, as Sopater did, but went before him to Troas, which was in Asia, and there waited for him; though the Syriac version reads in the plural number; but then it renders the words, "they went forth with him", as they might do from Greece, and yet not accompany him into Asia: the phrase into Asia is left out in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions. <p>And of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; the former of these is before said to be a Macedonian, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> and here he appears to be of Thessalonica, and his name is a Greek one; but Secundus is a Roman name, though he might be born at Thessalonica, or at least have lived there, and so be said to be of it. His name signifies "Second"; very likely was his father's second son, and therefore so called; though the name was used among the Grecians. We read of Secundus an Athenian, the master of Herod the sophist, who flourished under the emperor Adrian, there are sentences under his name still extant; and another called Secundus the grammarian, a friend of Poleman, a philosopher at Athens, who corrected his writings; so that this man might be a Grecian, and a native of Thessalonica; mention is made of him nowhere else. <p>And Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; the former of these is so called to distinguish him from Gaius the Macedonian in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> and the latter by being joined with him should be of the same place, as he might be; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a> though the Syriac version reads, "and Timotheus of Lystra"; and so does the Arabic version used by De Dieu; and this is mentioned with Derbe in the above cited place. <p>And of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus: of the former see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-21.htm">Ephesians 6:21</a> and of the latter see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm">Acts 21:29</a> where he is called an Ephesian, as they both are here in Beza's most ancient copy; Ephesus being the metropolis of Asia, strictly so called. These are both of them said to be among the seventy disciples: Trophimus, we are told, taught at Arles in France, and suffered martyrdom with the Apostle Paul; and that Tychicus was bishop of Chalcedon in Bithynia; and that another of the same name was bishop of Colophon; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-1.htm">Luke 10:1</a>. Trophimus signifies "nourished", and is a name to be found in a funeral inscription of the Romans (h), though Greek, and in the fragments of the poet Menander: and Tychicus signifies "fortunate"; whether the same with Fortunatus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm">1 Corinthians 16:17</a> may be inquired. <p>(h) Kirchman. de Funer.

In his view the words are an antithesis to <span class="greekheb">Ἀσιανοὶ δέ</span>, so that whilst on the one hand one party, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, six of the deputies, travel with Paul to Philippi, on the other hand the other party consisting of two, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the Asian representatives, waited for them at Troas. At Philippi the six deputies and Paul were joined by St. Luke, who henceforth speaks of the deputation in the first person plural, and identifies himself with its members as a colleague. Then from Troas the whole party proceed to Jerusalem (<span class="ital">Acts</span>, pp. 119, 303). In this way <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a> is restricted to Tychicus and Trophimus (see also Ramsay, as below), whereas A. and R.V. refer the pronoun to all the deputies, so too Weiss and Wendt. If this is so, the <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a>, <span class="ital">might</span> refer (but see further below) only to Paul and Luke, as the latter would naturally rejoin Paul at Philippi where we left him, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation.">Acts 16:17</a>. Ramsay explains (<span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 287) that the discovery of the Jewish plot altered St. Paul’s plan, and that too at the last moment, when delegates from the Churches had already assembled. The European delegates were to sail from Corinth, and the Asian from Ephesus, but the latter having received word of the change of plan went as far as Troas to meet the others, <span class="greekheb">οὗτοι</span> thus referring to Tychicus and Trophimus alone (but see also Askwith, <span class="ital">Epistle to the Galatians</span> (1899), pp. 94, 95).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Wendt also favours retention of <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τῆς Ἀ</span>. and prefers the reading <span class="greekheb">προσελθόντες</span>, but he takes <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a> to exclude St. Paul, and refers it to other friends of the Apostle (as distinct from those who accompanied him through Macedonia “as far as Asia”), <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the author of the “We” sections and others who only now meet the Apostle and his company at Troas. But this obliges us to make a somewhat artificial distinction between <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a> with <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐξεπ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἤλθομεν</span> on the one hand, and <span class="greekheb">διετρίψαμεν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, on the other, as the latter must be taken to include St. Paul, St. Luke, and the whole company, although Wendt justifies the distinction by pointing out that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot.">Acts 20:13</a> <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> is used exclusive of Paul (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-12.htm" title="And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, sought him not to go up to Jerusalem.">Acts 21:12</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mr. Askwith, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 93 ff., has recently argued that <span class="greekheb">ἡμεῖς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a> includes not only St. Luke and St. Paul, but with them the representatives of Achaia (who are not mentioned by name with the other deputies) who would naturally be with St. Paul on his return from Corinth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,...">Acts 20:2-3</a>, and he would not travel through Macedonia unaccompanied. In 2 Corinthians 8 St. Luke, “the brother,” according to tradition, whose praise in the Gospel was spread through all the Churches, had been sent to Corinth with Titus and another “brother,” and so naturally any representatives from Achaia would come along with them, pp. 93, 94. No names are given because St. Luke himself was amongst them, and he never mentions his own name, p. 96. The fact that Timothy and Sopater who had been with the Apostle at Corinth when he wrote to the Romans (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm" title="And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.">Acts 16:21</a>, if we may identify <span class="greekheb">Σωσίπατρος</span> with the <span class="greekheb">Σώπατρος Πύρρου Βεροιαῖος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>) are amongst those who waited at Troas is accounted for on the supposition that Timothy and others might naturally go across to inform the Asiatic delegates of Paul’s change of plan, and would then proceed with these Asian representatives to Troas to meet the Apostle (p. 94). The presence of Aristarchus and Secundus at Troas is accounted for on the ground that St. Paul, on his way to Achaia, did not expect to return through Macedonia, and so would naturally arrange for the Macedonian delegates, who were not accompanying him into Greece, to meet him somewhere. And the delegates from Thessalonica would naturally cross to Troas with the intention of proceeding to Ephesus (or Miletus), where St. Paul would have touched even if he had sailed for Palestine from Cenchreæ (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow....">Acts 18:18-19</a>), p. 95. But against this it may be fairly urged that there is no reason to assume that the Macedonian delegates did <span class="ital">not</span> accompany Paul into Greece; Timothy and Sosipater had evidently done so, and all the delegates mentioned seem to have been together in St. Paul’s company, <span class="greekheb">συνείπετο αὐτῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>. In the uncertain state of the text it is difficult to come to any decision on the passage. The words <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τῆς Ἀσίας</span> may easily have been omitted on account of the supposed difficulty connected with the fact that two at least of St. Paul’s companions who are named, Trophimus and Aristarchus, went further than Asia, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-29.htm" title="(For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.)">Acts 21:29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-2.htm" title="And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; one Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.">Acts 27:2</a>, while on the other hand it is somewhat hard to believe that the words could be inserted by a later hand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On “The Pauline Collection for the Saints and its importance,” and the representatives of the Churches in the different provinces, see Rendall, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, November, 1893; Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 287, and “Corinth,” Hastings’ B.D.; Wendt, p. 325 (1899); Hort, <span class="ital">Rom.</span> and <span class="ital">Ephes.</span>, pp. 39 ff. and 173. Nothing could more clearly show the immense importance which St. Paul attached to this contribution for the poor saints than the fact that he was ready to present in person at Jerusalem the members of the deputation and their joint offerings, and that too at a time when his presence in the capital was full of danger, and after he had been expressly warned of the peril, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>.

Such a scheme would not only unite all the Gentile Churches in one holy bond of faith and charity, but it would mark their solidarity with the Mother Church at Jerusalem; it would be a splendid fulfilment by their own generous and loyal effort of the truth that if one member of the body suffered all the members suffered with it. We know how this vision which St. Paul had before his eyes of a universal brotherhood throughout the Christian world seemed to tarry; and we may understand something of the joy which filled his heart, even amidst his farewell to the elders at Miletus, as he anticipated without misgiving the accomplishment of this <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> to the saints, a “ministry” which he had received from the Lord Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-24.htm" title="But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear to myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.">Acts 20:24</a>.

He was also at hand when the Apostle wrote to Titus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-12.htm" title="When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, be diligent to come to me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to winter.">Titus 3:12</a>), and also had been with St Paul in the later imprisonment, when the second Epistle to Timothy was written (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm" title="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.">Acts 4:12</a>) and had again been sent to Ephesus. Perhaps Tychicus like Trophimus was by birth an Ephesian. Trophimus also continued much with St Paul, for we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2 Timothy 4:20</a>) that the Apostle at that time had left him detained by sickness at Miletus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνείπετο</span>, <span class="ital">there accompanied</span> him) A delightful retinue.—<span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τῆς Ἀσίας</span>, <span class="ital">as far as to Asia</span>) In Asia a part of them departed, a part remained with Paul: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-13.htm" title="And we went before to ship, and sailed to Assos, there intending to take in Paul: for so had he appointed, minding himself to go afoot....">Acts 20:13-14</a>.

If it were merely said, "there accompanied him," it might have been thought, with regard to the Macedonians Sopater, Aristarchus, and Secundus, that they had merely gone as far as their respective cities, Beraea and Thessalonica; it is therefore added (in most manuscripts, though not in B or the Codex Sinaiticus), "as far as Asia." It does not necessarily follow that they all went as fax as Jerusalem, though we know Trophimus and Aristarchus did. <span class="cmt_word">Sopater</span> may probably be the same as <span class="accented">Sosipater</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>), whom St. Paul calls "his kinsman," though some think "the son of Pyrrhus" was added to distinguish him from him.
