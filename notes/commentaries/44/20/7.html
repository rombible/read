It lies in the nature of the case that those who were slaves, or freed-men still in service, under heathen masters could not transfer to it the rigid abstinence from labour which characterised the Jewish Sabbath. And on this day they met together, obviously in the evening after sunset, to “break bread.” On the half- technical significance of that phrase, as applied specially to the Lord’s Supper, the Communion of the Body and Blood of Christ, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?">1Corinthians 10:16</a>. Two further questions, however, present themselves—(1) On what evening was the meeting held? (2) How far was a meal such as was known as the <span class= "ital">Agapè, </span>or Feast of Charity, united with the Lord’s Supper? In answer to (1), it seems probable that in churches which were so largely organised on the framework of the Jewish synagogue, and contained so many Jews and proselytes who had been familiar with its usages, the Jewish mode of reckoning would still be kept, and that, as the Sabbath ended at sunset, the first day of the week would begin at sunset on what was then or soon afterwards known as Saturday. In this case, the meeting of which we read would be held on what we should call the Saturday evening, and the feast would present some analogies to the prevalent Jewish custom of eating bread and drinking wine at that time in honour of the departed Sabbath (Jost, <span class= "ital">Gesch. Judenthums, </span>i. 180). (2) Looking to St. Paul’s directions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-33.htm" title="Why, my brothers, when you come together to eat, tarry one for another.">1Corinthians 11:33-34</a>, it is probable that the hour of the “breaking bread” became gradually later, so as to allow those who would otherwise have been hungry to take their evening meal at home before they came. The natural result of this arrangement was, as in the instance now before us, to throw the Eucharistic rite forward to midnight, or even later; and, as this was obviously likely to cause both inconvenience and scandal, the next step was to separate it entirely from the <span class= "ital">Agapè, </span>and to celebrate the purely symbolic feast very early in the morning of the first day of the week, while the actual meal came later in the evening of the same day. That this was so in the regions of Troas and Asia we see from Pliny’s letter to Trajan (<span class= "ital">Epp.</span> x. 96), in which he describes the Christians as meeting on “a fixed day,” for what he calls a <span class= "ital">sacramentum</span> at break of day, and again in the evening to partake of a simple and innocent repast. At Troas we have the connecting-link between the evening communion of the Church of Corinth, and the morning celebration which has been for many centuries the universal practice of the Church.<p><span class= "bld">Paul preached unto them.</span>—The fact has a liturgical interest as showing that then, as in the more developed services of the second and third centuries, the sermon, and the lessons from Scripture which it implied, preceded what we now know as the Celebration.<p><span class= "bld">Ready to depart on the morrow.</span>—It may perhaps seem to some strange, taking the view maintained in the previous Note, that the Apostle and his companions should thus purpose to travel on a day to which we have transferred so many of the restrictions of the Jewish Sabbath. But it must be remembered (1) that there is no evidence that St. Paul thought of them as so transferred, but rather the contrary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-10.htm" title="You observe days, and months, and times, and years.">Galatians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16</a>); and (2) that the ship in which his friends had taken their passage was not likely to alter its day of starting to meet their scruples, even had those scruples existed.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-7.htm" title="And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight....">Acts 20:7-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">And upon the first day of the week, when the disciples </span>— As was usual with them on that day; <span class="ital">came together </span>— From different parts; <span class="ital">to break bread </span>— That is, to celebrate the Lord’s supper. It is well known the primitive Christians administered the eucharist every Lord’s day, and as that was the most solemn and appropriate, as well as the concluding act of their worship, it is no wonder that it should be mentioned as the end of their assembling. <span class="ital">Paul preached unto them </span>— With great fervency, being now to take his leave of them, and <span class="ital">depart on the morrow </span>— And his heart was so enlarged in love to his hearers, and concern for their salvation, that he <span class="ital">continued his </span>speech <span class="ital">until midnight </span>— Through uncommon fervour of spirit. <span class="ital">And there were many lights </span>— Or lamps; <span class="ital">in the upper chamber where they were assembled </span>— For, whatever the malice of their enemies might insinuate, the Christians held not their assemblies in darkness, but took all prudent precautions to avoid every circumstance that might incur censure, or even suspicion. <span class="ital">And there sat in a window </span>— Kept open to prevent heat, both from the lamps and the number of people; <span class="ital">a young man, named Eutychus, </span>who, having <span class="ital">fallen into a deep sleep, as Paul was long preaching, fell down from the third loft </span>— And no wonder, if, like the eastern windows, described by Chardin, this was very large, and even with the floor; <span class="ital">and was taken up dead — </span>Really and properly so; <span class="ital">and </span>(the whole assembly, doubtless, being thrown into disorder) <span class="ital">Paul </span>— Breaking off his discourse; <span class="ital">went down and fell on him — </span>It is observable, our Lord never used this gesture, but Elijah and Elisha did, as well as Paul; <span class="ital">and embracing high </span>— In his arms; <span class="ital">said, Trouble not yourselves </span>— Be not in any disorder about it; <span class="ital">for his life is in him </span>— He is come to life again. Paul, doubtless, restored him to life by a miracle. <span class="ital">When he therefore was come up again </span>— Into the chamber where the assembly met; (for, having composed and quieted their minds, he returned to his work;) <span class="ital">and had broken bread </span>— And conversed a considerable time; even <span class="ital">till break of day, he departed </span>— From Troas, without taking any rest at all. <span class="ital">And they brought the young man alive </span>— And well into the room; <span class="ital">and were not a little comforted </span>— At so happy an event; and the rather, as they might apprehend that some reproach would have been occasioned by his death, if he had not been so recovered, because it happened in a Christian assembly, which had been protracted so long beyond the usual bounds of time, on this extraordinary occasion. But, alas! how many of those that have allowed themselves to sleep under sermons, or, as it were, to dream awake, have perished for ever, with the neglected sound of the gospel in their ears; have slept the sleep of eternal death, and are fallen to rise no more!<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:7-12 Though the disciples read, and meditated, and prayed, and sung apart, and thereby kept up communion with God, yet they came together to worship God, and so kept up their communion with one another. They came together on the first day of the week, the Lord's day. It is to be religiously observed by all disciples of Christ. In the breaking of the bread, not only the breaking of Christ's body for us, to be a sacrifice for our sins, is remembered, but the breaking of Christ's body to us, to be food and a feast for our souls, is signified. In the early times it was the custom to receive the Lord's supper every Lord's day, thus celebrating the memorial of Christ's death. In this assembly Paul preached. The preaching of the gospel ought to go with the sacraments. They were willing to hear, he saw they were so, and continued his speech till midnight. Sleeping when hearing the word, is an evil thing, a sign of low esteem of the word of God. We must do what we can to prevent being sleepy; not put ourselves to sleep, but get our hearts affected with the word we hear, so as to drive sleep far away. Infirmity requires tenderness; but contempt requires severity. It interrupted the apostle's preaching; but was made to confirm his preaching. Eutychus was brought to life again. And as they knew not when they should have Paul's company again, they made the best use of it they could, and reckoned a night's sleep well lost for that purpose. How seldom are hours of repose broken for the purposes of devotion! but how often for mere amusement or sinful revelry! So hard is it for spiritual life to thrive in the heart of man! so naturally do carnal practices flourish there!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And upon the first day of the week - Showing thus that this day was then observed by Christians as holy time.

Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>. So the Syriac understands it, by translating it, "to break the eucharist"; that is, the eucharistic bread. It is probable that the apostles and early Christians celebrated the Lord's Supper on every Lord's day.<p>And continued his speech until midnight - The discourse of Paul continued until the breaking of day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-11.htm">Acts 20:11</a>. But it was interrupted about midnight by the accident that occurred to Eutychus. The fact that Paul was about to leave them on the next day, probably to see them no more, was the principal reason why his discourse was so long continued. We are not to suppose, however, that it was one continued or set discourse. No small part of the time might have been passed in hearing and answering questions, though Paul was the chief speaker. The case proves that such seasons of extraordinary devotion may, in special circumstances, be proper. Occasions may arise where it will be proper for Christians to spend a much longer time than usual in public worship. It is evident, however, that such seasons do not often occur. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. upon the first day of the week, when the disciples came together&#8212;This, compared with 1Co 16:2, and other similar allusions, plainly indicates that the Christian observance of the day afterwards distinctly called "the Lord's Day," was already a fixed practice of the churches.<p>Paul preached&#8212;discoursed.

Or Lord's day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm">Revelation 1:10</a> and which Justin Martyr calls Sunday; on which day, he says (i), all, both in city and country, met in one place for religious worship; and on this day, it appears from hence, and from other places, that the apostles and primitive churches did meet together for religious exercises; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a> and so they did at Troas at this time, as follows: <p>when the disciples came together to break bread; not to eat a common meal, or to make a feast, or grand entertainment for the apostle and his company, before they departed; but, as the Syriac version renders it, "to break the eucharist", by which the Lord's supper was called in the primitive times; or as the Arabic version, "to distribute the body of Christ", which is symbolically and emblematically held forth in the bread at the Lord's table. Now on the first day of the week, the disciples, or the members of the church at Troas, met together on this occasion, and the apostle, and those that were with him, assembled with them for the same purpose; the Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Ethiopic versions read, "when we were come together"; Paul and his company, together with the church at Troas; for it is plain from hence that there was a church in this place, not only by disciples being here, but by the administration of the Lord's supper to them; and so there was in after ages. Who was the first pastor or bishop of this church, is not certain; perhaps Carpus, of whom mention is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a> though he is said to be bishop of other places;  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-13.htm">2 Timothy 4:13</a>. In the "second" century, in the times of Ignatius, there were brethren at Troas, from whence he wrote his epistles to the churches at Smyrna, and Philadelphia, and who are saluted in them by the brethren at Troas (k): in the third century, several martyrs suffered here, as Andreas, Paulus, Nicomachus, and Dionysia a virgin: in the "fifth" century, Pionius, bishop of Troas, was present at Constantinople at the condemnation of Eutyches, and afterwards he was in the council at Chalcedon; and even in the "eighth" century mention is made of Eustathius, bishop of Troas, in the Nicene council (l). <p>Paul preached unto them; to the disciples that were gathered together, either before, or after, or at the time of breaking of bread; for this ordinance was not administered without some instructions about the nature, use, and design of it. <p>Ready to depart on the morrow; this seems to be mentioned as a reason for what follows, <p>continued his speech until midnight: since he was about to take his leave of them, and not knowing when he should see them again, or whether ever any more, he delivered a long discourse to them; which not only shows that he was full of matter, but that his affection for these saints, and his desire of doing them good, were very great, by imparting as much spiritual light and knowledge as he could unto them; and also his great zeal for the glory of God, and the interest of Christ, though he was to set forth on a journey the next morning. <p>(i) Apolog. 2. p. 98.

It is true the meeting was only still in an upper chamber, but the “many lights” shews that it was not a mere gathering of one or two with the Apostle and his friends, but a settled Christian congregation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ready</span> [<span class="bld">intending</span>] <span class="ital">to depart on the morrow</span>] They had met first for an evening service, but the consolation of Christian intercourse and the additional zeal infused into the church by the Apostle’s visit caused the irregular conversational meeting to be protracted beyond the intended time.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and continued his speech until midnight</span>] The “prolonged” of the <span class="ital">Rev.

It rather gives the impression that the Apostle had worn out all his hearers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm" title="And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.">Acts 20:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνηγμένων ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">when we were met together</span>) as already at that time they were wont, <span class="ital">on the Lord’s day</span>.

This is an important evidence of the keeping of the Lord's day by the Church as a day for their Church assemblies (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1, 30, 35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To break bread</span>. This is also an important example of weekly communion as the practice of the first Christians. Comparing the phrase, "to break bread," with St. Luke's account of the institution of the Holy Eucharist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-19.htm">Luke 22:19</a>) and the passages just quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24.htm">Luke 24</a>, and St. Paul's language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>), it is impossible not to conclude that the breaking of bread in the celebration of the Lord's Supper is an essential part of the holy sacrament, which man may not for any specious reasons omit. Further, this passage seems to indicate that evening Communion, after the example of the first Lord's Supper, was at this time the practice of the Church. It was preceded (see ver. 11) by the preaching of the Word. The following description, given by Justin Martyr, in his second Apology to Antoninus Plus (or Marcus Aurelius), of the Church assemblies in his day, not a hundred years after this time, is in exact agreement with it: - "On the day which is called Sunday, all (Christians) who dwell either in town or country come together to one place. The memoirs of the apostles and the writings of the prophets are read for a certain time, and then the president of the meeting, when the reader has stopped, makes a discourse, in which he instructs and exhorts the people to the imitation of the good deeds of which they have just heard. We then all rise up together, and address prayers (to God); and, when our prayers are ended, bread and wine and water are brought, and the president, to the best of his ability, offers up both prayers and thanksgivings, and the people assent, saving 'Amen.' And then the distribution of the bread and wine, over which the thanksgivings have been offered, is made to all present, and all partake of it." He adds that the elements are carried to the absent by the deacons, and that collections are made for poor widows, and orphans, and sick, and prisoners. <span class="cmt_word">Discoursed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-17.htm">Acts 17:17</a>, note. <span class="cmt_word">Prolonged</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;</span>).
