The partnership with Aquila and Priscilla (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>) continued. Philemon was probably a sharer in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-17.htm" title="If you count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.">Philemon 1:17</a>). And the Apostle had not been satisfied with working for himself, but ministered also to “those who were with him.” His teaching in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2Thessalonians 3:10</a> makes it improbable that he would have thus laboured to maintain others who were able-bodied in idleness, and the words that immediately follow make it almost certain that we must confine the statement to those who were suffering from infirmity. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:">1Corinthians 4:12</a>, written, it will be remembered, from Ephesus, we have an undesigned coincidence confirming the statement.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:28-38 If the Holy Ghost has made ministers overseers of the flock, that is, shepherds, they must be true to their trust. Let them consider their Master's concern for the flock committed to their charge. It is the church He has purchased with his own blood. The blood was his as Man; yet so close is the union between the Divine and human nature, that it is there called the blood of God, for it was the blood of Him who is God. This put such dignity and worth into it, as to ransom believers from all evil, and purchase all good. Paul spake about their souls with affection and concern. They were full of care what would become of them. Paul directs them to look up to God with faith, and commends them to the word of God's grace, not only as the foundation of their hope and the fountain of their joy, but as the rule of their walking. The most advanced Christians are capable of growing, and will find the word of grace help their growth. As those cannot be welcome guests to the holy God who are unsanctified; so heaven would be no heaven to them; but to all who are born again, and on whom the image of God is renewed, it is sure, as almighty power and eternal truth make it so. He recommends himself to them as an example of not caring as to things of the present world; this they would find help forward their comfortable passage through it. It might seem a hard saying, therefore Paul adds to it a saying of their Master's, which he would have them always remember; It is more blessed to give than to receive: it seems they were words often used to his disciples. The opinion of the children of this world, is contrary to this; they are afraid of giving, unless in hope of getting. Clear gain, is with them the most blessed thing that can be; but Christ tell us what is more blessed, more excellent. It makes us more like to God, who gives to all, and receives from none; and to the Lord Jesus, who went about doing good. This mind was in Christ Jesus, may it be in us also. It is good for friends, when they part, to part with prayer. Those who exhort and pray for one another, may have many weeping seasons and painful separations, but they will meet before the throne of God, to part no more. It was a comfort to all, that the presence of Christ both went with him and stayed with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, ye yourselves know - By your own acquaintance with my manner of life. In Corinth he had lived and labored with Apollos (note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>); and he refers elsewhere to the fact that he had supported himself, in part at least, by his own labor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm">1 Corinthians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a>. We may hence learn that it is no discredit to a minister to labor. Whatever it may be to a people who put him under a necessity to toil for his support, yet the example of Paul shows that a man should rejoice in the privilege of preaching the gospel, even if it is done while he is obliged to resort to labor for his daily bread. It is well when a minister of the gospel can make an appeal to his people like this of Paul, and say, "I have coveted no man's gold, or silver, or apparel." Every minister should so live that he can make this appeal to their own consciences of the sincerity and disinterestedness of his labors from the pulpit; or when called to separate from them as Paul did; or when on a dying bed. Every minister of the gospel, when be comes to lie down to die, will desire to be able to make this appeal, and to leave a solemn testimony there, that it was not for gold, or ease, or fame, that he toiled in the ministerial office. How much more influence will such a man have than he who has been worldly-minded; he who has sought to become rich; and he, the only memorials of whose life is, that he has sought "the fleece, not the flock" - that he has gained the property, not the souls of people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. these hands&#8212;doubtless holding them up, as before Agrippa in chains (Ac 26:29).<p>have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me&#8212;See Ac 18:3; 1Co 4:12; 9:6, written from Ephesus; also 1Th 2:9.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> St. Paul working hard (as they all knew) for a livelihood, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-12.htm" title="And labor, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer it:">1 Corinthians 4:12</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-9.htm" title="For you remember, brothers, our labor and travail: for laboring night and day, because we would not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.">1 Thessalonians 2:9</a></span>; which he gives an account of, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-8.htm" title="Neither did we eat any man's bread for nothing; but worked with labor and travail night and day, that we might not be chargeable to any of you:">2 Thessalonians 3:8</a></span>, to have been done only that in such a juncture, they being poor, and the false teachers watching all advantages against him, he might not then be chargeable to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yea, you yourselves know,....
