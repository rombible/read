We may take for granted that St. Paul would revisit the churches which he had himself founded at Thessalonica and Beræa, as well as at Philippi. The names in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> indicate that delegates were chosen, probably by his direction, for the great journey to Jerusalem, which he now began to contemplate. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a> indicates a yet wider range of activity. He had taken the great Roman road across Macedonia, and going westward to the shores of the Adriatic, had preached the gospel in Illyricum, where as yet it had not been heard.<p><span class= "bld">He came into Greece.</span>—The word Hellas, or Greece, seems used as synonymous with Achaia, the southern province. This may have led to an unrecorded visit to Athens. It certainly brought him to Corinth and Cenchreæ. There, we may hope, he found all his hopes fulfilled. Gaius was there to receive him as a guest, and Erastus was still a faithful friend. There, if not before, he found Timotheus, and he had with him Jason of Thessalonica and Sosipater of Berœa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21-23</a>). In one respect, however, he found a great change, and missed many friends. The decree of Claudius had either been revoked or was no longer acted on. Aquila and Priscilla had gone straight from Ephesus to Rome on hearing that they could do so with safety, and with them the many friends, male and female, most of them of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> class, whom he had known in Corinth, and whose names fill so large a space in Romans 16. The desire which he had felt before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.">Acts 19:21</a>) to see Rome was naturally strengthened by their absence. His work in Greece was done, and he felt an impulse, not merely human, drawing him to the further west. A rapid journey to Jerusalem, a short visit there, to show how generous were the gifts which the Gentile Churches sent to the Churches of the Circumcision, and then the desire of his life might be gratified. To preach the gospel in Rome, to pass on from Rome to the Jews at Cordova and other cities in Spain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/15-24.htm" title="Whenever I take my journey into Spain, I will come to you: for I trust to see you in my journey, and to be brought on my way thitherward by you, if first I be somewhat filled with your company.">Romans 15:24-28</a>),—that was what he now proposed to himself. How different a path was actually marked out for him the sequel of the story shows.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when he had gone over those parts </span>— Zealously pursuing everywhere the work in which he was engaged; <span class="ital">and had given much exhortation — </span>To the Christians whom he found there, or <span class="ital">had exhorted them with much discourse; he came into Greece </span>— That part of it which lay between Macedonia and Achaia.

But, after great anxiety in his mind, he was at length comforted by the coming of Titus, who brought him a pleasing account of the state of affairs at Corinth. And in particular, what he said of their liberal disposition gave the apostle reason to glory in them, and to excite the Macedonians to imitate their generosity in assisting the contribution he was now raising for the poor Christians in Judea, which was one part of his business in this journey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;...">2 Corinthians 8:1-14</a>. The second epistle to the Corinthians was therefore written from Macedonia at this time, as these passages manifest, and was sent by Titus, who, on this occasion, returned to get the collection in still greater forwardness. This journey through the different towns of Macedonia, in which churches were established, of course took up several months; and no doubt many circumstances occurred, at most of these places, which made his presence with them for a while highly expedient. Perhaps also it was at this time that he preached the gospel on the confines of Illyricum, as mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-6 Tumults or opposition may constrain a Christian to remove from his station or alter his purpose, but his work and his pleasure will be the same, wherever he goes.

Some have judged this to be very probable, and that in this Macedonian residence St Luke’s Gospel may have been written. It was also, as it seems, at this time that St Paul made the journey into Illyricum alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and had given them much exhortation</span>] We may form some idea of the topics which would be embraced by such exhortation, if we read the two Epistles to the Thessalonians which had been written to that Church since St Paul’s former visit to Macedonia. The most marked language in the first Epistle is against sorrowing immoderately for the dead. By the words of St Paul on this subject the Christian congregation had been much troubled concerning the nearness of the coming of the Son of Man, and the second letter is written to bring them to a calm and thoughtful mind. The Apostle’s much exhortation would be an echo of what he had said in his letters, “Watch and be sober,” “Abstain from every form of evil,” “Be at peace among yourselves.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he came into Greece</span>] There is nothing said of the places which St Paul visited in this journey, but as he was always anxious to strengthen any work which he had before begun we may feel sure that Athens and Corinth, on this account, as well as for their importance as centres of intellectual and commercial life, were the places in which he spent the greater part of his three months’ stay. In the latter Church especially there were many things to be set in order. He had already written to the Corinthians his two Epistles. In the first, sent from Ephesus, he had found it necessary to rebuke them for the party-spirit in the Church, some calling themselves by the name of Peter, some of Apollos and some of Paul himself, instead of finding true unity in Christ; he had also censured the disorders in the Eucharistic feast, had given his judgment on a notorious offender, and on many topics raised by the difficulties of a Christian Church rising up amid heathen surroundings. These matters, and the guidance into a right channel of the exercise of those special gifts of preaching and speaking with tongues with which God endowed the Church in Corinth, would give the Apostle little rest during his brief stay even if he bestowed his whole time on Corinth alone.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/20.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐκεῖνα</span>, <span class="ital">those</span>) parts of Macedonia.—<span class="greekheb">λόγῳ πολλῷ</span>, <span class="ital">with much exhortation</span>) Paul was especially abounding (overflowing with edifying speech; at this time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm" title="And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.">Acts 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-9.htm" title="And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep: and as Paul was long preaching, he sunk down with sleep, and fell down from the third loft, and was taken up dead.">Acts 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-11.htm" title="When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.">Acts 20:11</a>; wherefore also he at that time wrote several epistles.—<span class="greekheb">Ἑλλάδα</span>, <span class="ital">Greece</span>) that part of Greece which was between Macedonia and Achaia.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> <span class="accented">- Through</span> for <span class="accented">over</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">When he had gone through</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>); see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-4.htm">Acts 8:4, 40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm">Acts 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm">Acts 18:23</a>, note, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm">Luke 9:6</a>.

Bengel and others understand Hellas here of the country between Macedonia and the Peloponnesus, especially Attica; which would make it probable that St. Paul revisited Athens. But Meyer, Kuinoel, Alford, 'Speaker's Commentary,' etc., think it is synonymous with Achaia. There must, however, be some reason for this unusual use of Hellas instead of Achaia. None seems so likely as that it was meant to cover wider ground than Achaia would naturally indicate, namely Attica. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Greece<p>The Roman province of Achaia, comprehending Greece proper and the Peloponnesus.
