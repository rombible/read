The metrical structure of the. close of the speech (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm" title="Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.">Acts 14:17</a>) leaves hardly a shadow of doubt on this point.<p><span class= "bld">We also are men of like passions with you.</span>—The word, which expresses participation in all the passive conditions of human life, as well as in what are commonly known as “passions,” occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm" title="Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on the earth by the space of three years and six months.">James 5:17</a>. There is, it will be noted, a striking parallelism between St. Paul’s language here, and that of Peter to Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-26.htm" title="But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.">Acts 10:26</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Ye should turn from these vanities.</span>—The demonstrative pronoun implies a corresponding gesture. The Apostle points to all the pomp and pageantry of the intended sacrifice. The words “vanity and “vain” were almost the invariable terms used by Jews to describe the emptiness and worthlessness of heathen worship (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-17.htm" title="This I say therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you from now on walk not as other Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,">Ephesians 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-18.htm" title="For as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain conversation received by tradition from your fathers;">1Peter 1:18</a>; and, in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-21.htm" title="And turn you not aside: for then should you go after vain things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.">1Samuel 12:21</a>). In contrast with these dead and dumb things, the Apostle calls on them to turn to God, who truly lives and acts, and is the source of all life and power, the Maker of heaven and earth, the Giver of all good gifts, the Judge of all evil deeds. In contrast, alike, with the popular polytheism which assigned heaven, and earth, and sea to different deities, and to the speculative Pantheism which excluded will and purpose from its conception of the Godhead, he proclaims the One God as having every attribute of personal Life and Being.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:8-18 All things are possible to those that believe. When we have faith, that most precious gift of God, we shall be delivered from the spiritual helplessness in which we were born, and from the dominion of sinful habits since formed; we shall be made able to stand upright and walk cheerfully in the ways of the Lord. When Christ, the Son of God, appeared in the likeness of men, and did many miracles, men were so far from doing sacrifice to him, that they made him a sacrifice to their pride and malice; but Paul and Barnabas, upon their working one miracle, were treated as gods. The same power of the god of this world, which closes the carnal mind against truth, makes errors and mistakes find easy admission. We do not learn that they rent their clothes when the people spake of stoning them; but when they spake of worshipping them; they could not bear it, being more concerned for God's honour than their own. God's truth needs not the services of man's falsehood. The servants of God might easily obtain undue honours if they would wink at men's errors and vices; but they must dread and detest such respect more than any reproach. When the apostles preached to the Jews, who hated idolatry, they had only to preach the grace of God in Christ; but when they had to do with the Gentiles, they must set right their mistakes in natural religion. Compare their conduct and declaration with the false opinions of those who think the worship of a God, under any name, or in any manner, is equally acceptable to the Lord Almighty. The most powerful arguments, the most earnest and affectionate addresses, even with miracles, are scarcely enough to keep men from absurdities and abominations; much less can they, without special grace, turn the hearts of sinners to God and to holiness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And saying, Sirs - Greek: Men.<p>Why do ye these things? - This is an expression of solemn remonstrance at the folly of their conduct in worshipping those who were human. The abhorrence which they evinced at this may throw strong light on the rank and character of the Lord Jesus Christ. When an offer was made to worship Paul and Barnabas, they shrank from it with strong expressions of aversion and indignation. Yet when similar worship was offered to the Lord Jesus; when he was addressed by Thomas in the language of worship, "My Lord and my God" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>, he uttered not the slightest reproof. Nay, he approved it, and expressed his approbation of others who should also do it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>. How can this difference be accounted for except on the supposition that the Lord Jesus was divine? Would he, if a mere man, receive homage as God, when his disciples rejected it with horror?<p>Of like passions with you - We are human beings like yourselves. We have no claim, no pretensions to anything more. The word "passions" here means simply that they had the common feelings and propensities of people - the nature of people; the affections of people. It does not mean that they were subject to any improper passions, to ill temper, etc., as some have supposed; but that they did not pretend to be gods. "We need food and drink; we are exposed to pain, and sickness, and death." The Latin Vulgate renders it, "We are mortal like yourselves." The expression stands opposed to the proper conception of God, who is not subject to these affections, who is most blessed and immortal. Such a Being only is to be worshipped; and the apostles remonstrated strongly with them on the folly of paying religious homage to beings like themselves. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-17.htm">James 5:17</a>, "Elias (Elijah) was a man subject to like passions as we are, etc."<p>That ye should turn from these vanities - That you should cease to worship idols. Idols are often called vanities, or vain things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-15.htm">2 Kings 17:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-13.htm">1 Kings 16:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-26.htm">1 Kings 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-5.htm">Jeremiah 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-19.htm">Jeremiah 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-8.htm">Jeremiah 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-8.htm">Jonah 2:8</a>. They are called vanities, a lie, or lying vanities, as opposed to the living and true God, because they are unreal; because they have no power to help: because confidence in them is vain.<p>Unto the living God - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. He is called the living God to distinguish him from idols. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16</a>.<p>Which made heaven ... - Who thus showed that he was the only proper object of worship. This doctrine, that there is one God who has made all things, was new to them. They worshipped multitudes of divinities; and though they regarded Jupiter as the father of gods and human beings, yet they had no conception that all things had been created by the will of one Infinite Being. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.
