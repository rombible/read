The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And thence sailed to Antioch - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm">Acts 11:19</a>.<p>From whence they had been recommended ... - Where they had been appointed to this missionary tour by the church, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-4</a>.<p>To the grace of God - His favor and protection had been implored for them in their perilous undertaking.<p>For the work which they fulfilled - This shows conclusively:<p>(1) That they had accomplished fully the work which was originally contemplated. It was strictly a missionary tour among the Gentiles. It was an important and hazardous enterprise, and was the first in which the church formally engaged. Hence, so much importance is attached to it, and so faithful a record of it is preserved.<p>(2) it shows that the act by which they were set apart to this <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1-3</a> was not an ordination to the ministerial office. It was an appointment to a missionary tour.<p>(3) it shows that the act was not an appointment to the apostleship. Paul was an apostle before by the express appointment of the Saviour; and Barnabas was never an apostle in the original and proper sense of the term. It was a designation to a temporary work, which was now fulfilled.<p>We may remark, also, in regard to this missionary tour:<p>(1) That the work of missions is one which early engaged the attention of Christians.<p>(2) it entered into their plans, and was one in which the church was deeply interested.<p>(3) the work of missions is attended with danger. People are now no less hostile to the gospel than they were in Lystra and Iconium.<p>(4) Missionaries should be sustained by the prayers of the church. And,<p>(5) In the conduct of Paul and Barnabas we have an example for missionaries in founding churches, and in regard to their own trials and persecutions. If they were persecuted, missionaries may be now; and if the grace of Christ was sufficient to sustain them, it is not the less sufficient to sustain those of our own times amidst all the dangers attending the preaching of the cross in pagan lands. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been recommended&#8212;(See on [2014]Ac 13:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Antioch; </span> that Antioch which was in Syria, as appears <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul....">Acts 13:1-3</a></span>, to which this relates; and is a sufficient proof that they had not sought God in vain, and that there is no better preparation or provision towards any business, than faithful prayer unto God concerning it; doing our duty, and leaving the event unto his disposing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thence sailed to Antioch,....
