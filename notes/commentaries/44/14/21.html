The work done implies a stay of, it may be, some months’ duration. During this time the violence of the hostility of the Jews at Antioch and Iconium had probably subsided, and the Apostles could revisit those cities, as they retraced their steps, without any great danger.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-21.htm" title="And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,...">Acts 14:21-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when they had preached, and taught many </span>— Namely, at Derbe; and, it seems also, in Galatia and Phrygia: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-13.htm" title=" For I bear him record, that he has a great zeal for you, and them that are in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis.">Colossians 4:13</a>.

The people stoned Paul, in a popular tumult. So strong is the bent of the corrupt and carnal heart, that as it is with great difficulty that men are kept back from evil on one side, so it is with great ease they are persuaded to evil on the other side. If Paul would have been Mercury, he might have been worshipped; but if he will be a faithful minister of Christ, he shall be stoned, and thrown out of the city. Thus men who easily submit to strong delusions, hate to receive the truth in the love of it. All who are converted need to be confirmed in the faith; all who are planted need to be rooted. Ministers' work is to establish saints as well as to awaken sinners. The grace of God, and nothing less, effectually establishes the souls of the disciples. It is true, we must count upon much tribulation, but it is encouragement that we shall not be lost and perish in it. The Person to whose power and grace the converts and the newly-established churches are commended, clearly was the Lord Jesus, on whom they had believed. It was an act of worship. The praise of all the little good we do at any time, must be ascribed to God; for it is He who not only worketh in us both to will and to do, but also worketh with us to make what we do successful. All who love the Lord Jesus, will rejoice to hear that he has opened the door of faith wide, to those who were strangers to him and to his salvation. And let us, like the apostles, abide with those who know and love the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had taught many - Or, rather, had made many disciples (margin).<p>To Lystra - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-6.htm">Acts 14:6</a>.<p>And to Iconium - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-1.htm">Acts 14:1</a>. We have here a remarkable instance of the courage of the apostles. In these very places they had been persecuted and stoned, and yet in the face of danger they ventured to return. The welfare of the infant churches they deemed of more consequence than their own safety; and they threw themselves again into the midst of danger, to comfort and strengthen those just converted to God.

But his thoughts did not center in an earthly home. He revisited the places where he had been reviled and persecuted, but where he had left as sheep in the desert the disciples whom his Master had enabled him to gather. They needed building up and strengthening in the faith, comforting in the midst of their inevitable suffering, and fencing round by permanent institutions. Undaunted therefore by the dangers that awaited them, our missionaries return to them, using words of encouragement which none but the founders of a true religion would have ventured to address to their earliest converts, that "we can only enter into the kingdom of God by passing through much tribulation" [Howson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Had taught many; </span> had made many disciples by teaching, and also by baptizing of them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a></span>.

No doubt they pursued the same course as at Lystra, and again we have direct proof that the teaching of the Gospel was not in vain: it is therefore quite unwarrantable to suppose that Paul’s speech at Lystra indicates the powerlessness of the message of the Gospel in contact with deep-rooted heathenism (Bethge); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/14-22.htm" title="Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God....">Acts 14:22-23</a> we have abundant proof that Paul had not limited his first preaching in Lystra to truths of natural religion, for now on his return the disciples are bidden <span class="greekheb">ἐμμένειν τῇ πίστει</span>, and they are commended to the Lord, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃν πεπιστεύκεισαν</span>, “on whom they had believed”.

Moreover, on their return journey the Apostles may have refrained from open and public preaching, and devoted themselves rather to the organisation of the Christian communities. (There is therefore no ground for Hilgenfeld’s and Wendt’s reference of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-19.htm" title="And there came thither certain Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and having stoned Paul, drew him out of the city, supposing he had been dead.">Acts 14:19</a> to a different source from the verse before us.) At the same time the courage of the Apostle is also noteworthy: “neque enim securum petit, ubi instar emeriti militis otio fruatur, sed etiam repetit loca, in quibus paullo ante male tractatus fuerat,” Calvin.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">and had taught many</span>] Better, “and had made many disciples.” Perhaps “Gaius of Derbe,” whom St Luke mentions as one of Paul’s companions in a subsequent journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), may have been one of these.
