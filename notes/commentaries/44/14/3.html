Yet the success was not to be reckoned to the manner of their preaching, but to the Spirit of God who used that means. Perseverance in doing good, amidst dangers and hardships, is a blessed evidence of grace. Wherever God's servants are driven, they should seek to declare the truth. When they went on in Christ's name and strength, he failed not to give testimony to the word of his grace. He has assured us it is the word of God, and that we may venture our souls upon it. The Gentiles and Jews were at enmity with one another, yet united against Christians. If the church's enemies join to destroy it, shall not its friends unite for its preservation? God has a shelter for his people in a storm; he is, and will be their Hiding-place. In times of persecution, believers may see cause to quit a spot, though they do not quit their Master's work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Long time therefore - It seems probable that there were here no forcible or public measures to expel them, as there had been at Antioch <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>, and they therefore regarded it as their duty to remain.

But there seems nothing unnatural in taking <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span> as marking a result from the events of the two previous verses, not from the second alone, or in the extended stay of the Apostles in the divided city. (Wendt (1899) supposes that in the original source <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm" title="Long time therefore stayed they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.">Acts 14:3</a> preceded <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-2.htm" title="But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brothers.">Acts 14:2</a>, which makes the sequence quite easy.
