Dr. Lightfoot reckons that the eleven apostles, the seventy disciples, and about thirty-nine more, all of Christ’s own kindred, country, and company, made up this one hundred and twenty; and that these were a sort of synod, or congregation of ministers, a standing presbytery, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-23.htm" title="And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.">Acts 4:23</a>,) to whom none of the rest durst join themselves, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-13.htm" title="And of the rest dared no man join himself to them: but the people magnified them.">Acts 5:13</a>; and that they continued together till the persecution at Stephen’s death dispersed them all but the apostles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm" title="And Saul was consenting to his death.

But he thinks that, besides these, there were many hundreds, if not thousands, in Jerusalem at this time who believed; and indeed we read of many who believed on him there, but durst not confess him.

The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In those days - On one of the days intervening between the ascension of Jesus and the day of Pentecost.<p>Peter stood up - Peter standing up, or rising. This is a customary expression in the Scriptures when one begins to do a thing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18</a>. The reason why Peter did this may be seen in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-16.htm">Matthew 16:16-17</a>. It is not improbable, besides, that Peter was the most aged of the apostles; and from his uniform conduct we know that he was the most ardent. It was perfectly characteristic, therefore, for him to introduce the business of the election of a new apostle.<p>The disciples - This was the name, which was given to them as being learners in the school of Christ. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-1.htm">Matthew 5:1</a>.<p>The number of the names - The number of the persons, or individuals. The word "name" is often used to denote "the person," <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-15.htm">Acts 18:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>. In Syriac it is, "The assembly of people was about an hundred and twenty." This was the first assembly convened to transact the business of the church; and it is not a little remarkable that the vote in so important a matter as electing apostle was by the entire church. It settles the question that the election of a minister and pastor should be by the church, and that a pastor should not be placed over a church by a patron, or by an ecclesiastical body. If a case could ever occur where it would be right and proper that one should be selected to exercise the office of a minister of Christ by the ministry only, the election of one to fall the office of an apostle was such a case. And yet in this the entire church had a voice. Whether this was all the true church at this time does not appear from the history. This expression cannot mean that there were no more Christians, but that these were all that had convened in the upper room. It is certain that our Saviour had, by his own ministry, brought many others to be his true followers.

That is, in one of the days after Christ's ascension, and before the day of Pentecost, whilst the disciples were waiting for the promise of the Spirit. The Ethiopic version reads, "on that day"; as if it was the same day they came first into Jerusalem, and went into the upper room; and which is likely enough; for no time was to be lost in choosing one in the room of Judas; when Peter, not only as a forward person, and who had been used to be the first mover and actor in any affair; but as willing to show his zeal for Christ, whom he had so lately denied, and as being the senior man in company, as well as the minister of the circumcision, rises, and stands up, as persons used to do, when about to make an oration, and in respect and reverence to the persons addressed: <p>in the midst of the disciples; not only the other ten, but the whole hundred and twenty. The Alexandrian copy, and some others, read, "in the midst of the brethren", and so reads the Vulgate Latin version; and the Ethiopic version, "in the midst of his own brethren", <p>and he said what is expressed in the following verses, which before the historian relates, he inserts in a parenthesis this clause, <p>the number of the names; that is, of persons; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-13.htm">Revelation 11:13</a>. Some copies read, "of the men", and so the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions; who <p>together, all put together in one sum, or as meeting together in one and the same place, or as agreeing in the same faith and judgment, so the Arabic version, "and there was there a company whose names and wills agreed in this same opinion"; they were all in one place, and of the same mind; and the sum of them <p>were about an hundred and twenty; among whom were the eleven apostles, and seventy disciples, which made eighty one; so that there were thirty nine persons more in this company: not that it is to be thought that these were all that were in Jerusalem that believed in Christ; but these were the number of the persons that met and embodied together in a church state, and who not only gave themselves to the Lord, but to one another, by the will of God; and their names being taken and registered, the historian calls the account of them, the number of the names, and not persons; though he means persons. This was a number pretty famous among the Jews; the sanhedrim of Ezra, called the men of the great synagogue, consisted of an "hundred and twenty elders"; the last of which was Simeon the just, and he comprehended the hundred and twenty (h). And such a number was requisite for a sanhedrim in any place; it is asked, <p>"how many must there be in a city, that it may be fit for a sanhedrim? "an hundred and twenty"; R. Nehemiah says two hundred and thirty (i): <p>but the decision is according to the former: hence they say (k), that "they fix in every city in Israel, where there is an "hundred and twenty", or more, a lesser sanhedrim.---A city in which there is not an hundred and twenty, they place three judges, for there is no sanhedrim less than three. <p>(h) Juchasin, fol. 13. 2.

But when we remember the stress laid by St. Luke in the opening chapters of the Acts upon the unanimity of the believers, it is not unlikely that he should use the phrase, at all events in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people.

Both Wendt and Feine reject the view that the number is merely mythical (Baur, Zeller, Overbeck, Weizsäcker), and would rather see in it a definite piece of information which St. Luke had gained. It is quite beside the mark to suppose that St. Luke only used this particular number because it represented the Apostles multiplied by 10, or 40 multiplied by 3.
