The question meets us whether the prayer is addressed to the Lord Jesus, as with a recollection of His insight into the hearts of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-24.htm" title="But Jesus did not commit himself to them, because he knew all men,">John 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-64.htm" title="But there are some of you that believe not.

The prayer of Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-59.htm" title="And they stoned Stephen, calling on God, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.">Acts 7:59-60</a>) shows, on the one hand, that direct prayer to the Son was not foreign to the minds of the disciples; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-70.htm" title="Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?">John 6:70</a>, He claims the act of choosing as His own. On the other hand, the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-29.htm" title="And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant to your servants, that with all boldness they may speak your word,">Acts 4:29</a>, where the Father is entreated to work signs and wonders “through his holy servant Jesus,” is in favour of the latter view.<p>“Whether,” as used in the sense of “which of two,” may be noted as one of the archaisms of the English version.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/1-24.htm" title="And they prayed, and said, You, Lord, which know the hearts of all men, show whether of these two you have chosen,...">Acts 1:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they prayed </span>— With great seriousness and solemnity, and in faith, persuaded their prayer would be answered; <span class="ital">Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men </span>— With all the counsels, the designs, and desires thereof, with every secret sentiment of the soul, and all the future circumstances of every one’s life; <span class="ital">show whether of these two thou hast chosen </span>— They do not say, which of the seventy, for in the opinion of all present, none could stand in competition with these; but, which of these two, for they were persuaded Christ would appoint one of them, and it was determined to acquiesce entirely in his choice. It is fit God should choose his own servants, and so far as, by the disposals of his providence, the gifts of his Spirit, or in any other way, he shows whom he hath chosen, or what he hath chosen for us, we ought readily to comply with him, and to be perfectly satisfied. It is a comfort to us to be assured, in all our prayers for the welfare of the church and its ministers, that the God we pray to knows the hearts of all men, and hath them not only under his eye, but in his hand, and can turn them which way soever he will; can make them fit for his purpose if he do not find them so, by giving them another spirit. <span class="ital">That he may take part of this ministry </span>— The ministry of the gospel, the apostleship; may join with us in the work of serving Christ and his church; and glorifying God in saving the souls of men, and may share with us in the honour and happiness thereof; <span class="ital">from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place — His own, </span>that is, says Grotius, “qui ipsi melius conveniebat quam apostolica functio,” which was more suitable for him than the apostolic office. The expression evidently means a place worthy of him, and which he had deserved by his sin. Hence some manuscripts, instead of <span class="greekheb">ιδιον</span>, <span class="ital">his own, </span>read <span class="greekheb">δικαιον</span>, <span class="ital">just; </span>that he might go to his just or proper place, a place agreeable to his actions, and therefore assigned him by the righteous judgment of God; namely, a place of punishment in hell. But it is objected, that it belonged not to Peter to pass sentence on Judas, or to affirm any thing of God’s secret counsels, such as Judas’s being consigned to future punishment. “This,” says Dr. Whitby, “is wonderful; that when Christ had pronounced him a <span class="ital">devil; </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-71.htm" title="He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.">John 6:71</a>;) <span class="ital">a son of perdition; </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>;) and declared that <span class="ital">it had been better for him that he had never been born; </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-24.htm" title="The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.">Matthew 26:24</a>;) it should be thought a diving into God’s secrets, to say he went into a place prepared for, or due to, such miscreants. Moreover, doth not our Saviour say, this fall of the son of perdition was foretold in the Scripture? <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-12.htm" title="While I was with them in the world, I kept them in your name: those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the scripture might be fulfilled.">John 17:12</a>. Does not Peter here apply those Scriptures to him, which foretel the most dreadful things? And does not Luke show the dreadful issue of his iniquity upon his body? And after all this, might he not say, he went <span class="ital">to a place proper for him? Whosoever betrays an Israelite into the hands of the Gentiles, </span>say the Jews, <span class="ital">hath no part in the world to come; </span>how much less he who betrays the Messiah, the king of Israel, into the hands of the Gentiles, or of his enemies? <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-19.htm" title="And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to whip, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Matthew 20:19</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-24.htm" title="The Son of man goes as it is written of him: but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been good for that man if he had not been born.">Matthew 26:24</a>.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:15-26 The great thing the apostles were to attest to the world, was, Christ's resurrection; for that was the great proof of his being the Messiah, and the foundation of our hope in him. The apostles were ordained, not to wordly dignity and dominion, but to preach Christ, and the power of his resurrection. An appeal was made to God; Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all men, which we do not; and better than they know their own. It is fit that God should choose his own servants; and so far as he, by the disposals of his providence, or the gifts of his Spirit, shows whom he was chosen, or what he has chosen for us, we ought to fall in with his will. Let us own his hand in the determining everything which befalls us, especially in those by which any trust may be committed to us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they prayed - As they could not agree on the individual, they invoked the direction of God in their choice - an example which should be followed in every selection of an individual to exercise the duties of the sacred office of the ministry.<p>Which knowest the hearts of all men - This is often declared to be the special prerogative of God, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-10.htm">Jeremiah 17:10</a>, "I, Yahweh, search the heart," etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-1.htm">Psalm 139:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-23.htm">Psalm 139:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/28-9.htm">1 Chronicles 28:9</a>.

There are strong reasons for supposing that the apostles on this occasion addressed this prayer to the Lord Jesus Christ:<p>(1) The name Lord - &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Kurios - is the common appellation which they gave to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59-60</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm">Acts 10:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-11.htm">Philippians 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>, et al.<p>(2) we are told that they worshipped him, or rendered him divine honors after his ascension, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-52.htm">Luke 24:52</a>.<p>(3) the disciples were accustomed to address him after his crucifixion by the names Lord or God indifferently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-28.htm">John 20:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>.<p>(4) this was a matter pertaining especially to the church which the Lord Jesus had redeemed, and "to his own arrangement" in regard to it. He had chosen the apostles; he had given them their commission; he had fixed their number; and, what is worthy of special remark here, he had been the companion of the very men here designated as candidates for the office, and knew their qualifications for this work. If the apostles ever called on the Lord Jesus after his ascension, this was a case in which they would be likely to do it. That it was done is clear from the account of the death of Stephen, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59-60</a>. And in this important matter of ordaining a new apostle to be a witness for Jesus Christ, nothing was more natural than that they should address him, though bodily absent, as they would assuredly have done if he were present. But if on this occasion they did actually address Christ, then two things clearly follow. First, that it is proper to render him divine homage, agreeably to the uniform declarations of the Scripture: <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-23.htm">John 5:23</a>, "That all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>, "And let all the angels of God worship him"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-10.htm">Philippians 2:10-11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/5-8.htm">Revelation 5:8-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:11-12</a>. Secondly, he must be divine. To none other but God can religious homage be rendered; and none other can be described as knowing the hearts of all people. The reason why they appealed to him on this occasion as the searcher of the heart was doubtless the great importance of the work to which the successor of Judas was to be called. One apostle of fair external character had proved a traitor; and, with this fact before them, they appealed to the Saviour himself to select one who would be true to him, and not bring dishonor upon his cause.<p>Show whether ... - Show which of them.<p>Thou hast chosen - Which of the two thou hast judged to be best qualified for the work. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. prayed and said, Thou, Lord, &c.&#8212;"The word 'Lord,' placed absolutely, denotes in the New Testament almost universally THE SON; and the words, 'Show whom Thou hast chosen,' are decisive.

A solemn circumstantiality of description. Judas is vividly depicted, as he, forsaking his apostleship (<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς</span>), has passed from that position to go to his own place. Comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-18.htm" title="A man that breaketh wedlock, saying thus in his heart, Who seeth me?

But the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὁ τόπος ὁ ἴδιος</span> (the expression is purposely chosen as correlative to <span class="greekheb">τὸν τόπον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">διακ</span>. etc.) is not to be decided from the linguistic use of <span class="greekheb">τόπος</span>, as <span class="greekheb">τόπος</span> may denote any place, but entirely from the context. And this requires us to understand by it Gehenna, which is conceived as the place to which Judas, according to his individuality, belongs. As his treason was so frightful a crime, the hearers could be in no doubt as to the <span class="greekheb">τόπος ἴδιος</span>. This explanation is also required for the completeness and energy of the speech, and is itself confirmed by analogous rabbinical passages; see in Lightfoot, e.g. Baal Turim, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-25.htm" title="And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way.">Numbers 24:25</a> : “Balaam ivit in locum suum, i.e. in Gehennam.” Hence the explanations are to be rejected which refer <span class="greekheb">τόπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἴδιος</span> to the habitation of Judas (Keuchen, Moldenhauer, Krebs, Bolten), or to that <span class="greekheb">χωρίον</span>, where he had perished (Elsner, Zeller, Lange, Baumgarten, and others), or to the “societas, quam cum sacerdotibus ceterisque Jesu adversariis inierat” (Heinrichs). Others (Hammond, Homberg, Heumann, Kypke, comp. already Oecumenius) refer <span class="greekheb">πορευθῆναι</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἴδιον</span> even to the successor of Judas, so that the <span class="greekheb">τόπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἴδιος</span> would be the apostleship destined for him. But such a construction would be involved (<span class="greekheb">πορευθ</span>. would require again to be taken as an object of <span class="greekheb">λαβεῖν</span>), and after <span class="greekheb">λαβεῖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποστολῆς</span> tautological. The reading <span class="greekheb">δίκαιον</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">ἴδιον</span>) in A hits the correct meaning. The contrast appears in Clem. Cor. I. 5 as to Paul: <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν ἅγιον τόπον ἐπορεύθη</span>, and as to Peter: <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸν ὀφειλόμενον τόπον τῆς δόξης</span>. Comp. Polyc. Phil. 9; Ignat.
