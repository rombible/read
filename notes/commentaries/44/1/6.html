Their minds were still full of a temporal kingdom to be erected by Christ, in which the Jews should have dominion over all nations; and “they seem to have expected, that when the Spirit was in so extraordinary a manner poured out, and the world, according to Christ’s prediction, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm" title="And when he is come, he will reprove the world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment:">John 16:8</a>,) convinced <span class="ital">of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, </span>the whole nation of the Jews would own him for their Messiah, and not only shake off its subjection to the Romans, but itself rise to very extensive, and, perhaps, universal dominion. The word <span class="greekheb">αποκαθιστανεις</span>, [here rendered <span class="ital">wilt thou restore,</span>] intimates the shattered and weakened state in which Israel now was.

Our Lord knew that his ascension and the teaching of the Holy Spirit would soon end these expectations, and therefore only gave them a rebuke; but it is a caution to his church in all ages, to take heed of a desire of forbidden knowledge. He had given his disciples instructions for the discharge of their duty, both before his death and since his resurrection, and this knowledge is enough for a Christian. It is enough that He has engaged to give believers strength equal to their trials and services; that under the influence of the Holy Spirit they may, in one way or other, be witnesses for Christ on earth, while in heaven he manages their concerns with perfect wisdom, truth, and love. When we stand gazing and trifling, the thoughts of our Master's second coming should quicken and awaken us: when we stand gazing and trembling, they should comfort and encourage us. May our expectation of it be stedfast and joyful, giving diligence to be found of him blameless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they therefore were come together - At the Mount of Olives. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-9.htm">Acts 1:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>.<p>Wilt thou at this time ... - The apostles had entertained the common opinions of the Jews about the temporal dominion of the Messiah. They expected that he would reign as a prince and conqueror, and would free them from the bondage of the Romans. Many instances where this expectation is referred to occur in the gospels, notwithstanding all the efforts which the Lord Jesus made to explain to them the true nature of his kingdom. This expectation was checked, and almost destroyed by his death <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a>, and it is clear that his death was the only means which could effectually change their opinions on this subject. Even his own instructions would not do it; and nothing but his being taken from them could direct their minds effectually to the true nature of his kingdom. Yet, though his death checked their expectations, and appeared to thwart their plans, his return to life excited them again. They beheld him with them; they were assured that it was the same Saviour; they saw now that his enemies had no power over him; they could not doubt that a being who could rise from the dead could easily accomplish all his plans. And as they did not doubt now that he would restore the kingdom to Israel, they asked whether he would do it at that time? They did not ask whether he would do it at all, or whether they had correct views of his kingdom; but, taking that for granted, they asked him whether that was the time in which he would do it. The emphasis of the inquiry lies in the expression, "at this time," and hence, the answer of the Saviour refers solely to the point of their inquiry, and not to the correctness or incorrectness of their opinions. From these expectations of the apostles we may learn:<p>(1) That there is nothing so difficult to be removed from the mind as prejudice in favor of erroneous opinions.<p>(2) that such prejudice will survive the plainest proofs to the contrary.<p>(3) that it will often manifest itself even after all proper means have been taken to subdue it. Erroneous opinions thus maintain a secret ascendency in a man's mind, and are revived by the slightest circumstances, even long after it was supposed that they were overcome, and in the face of the plainest proofs of reason or of Scripture.<p>Restore - Bring back; put into its former situation. Judea was formerly governed by its own kings and laws; now, it was subject to the Romans. This bondage was grievous, and the nation sighed for deliverance. The inquiry of the apostles evidently was, whether he would now free them from the bondage of the Romans, and restore them to their former state of freedom and prosperity, as in the times of David and Solomon. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-26.htm">Isaiah 1:26</a>. The word "restore" also may include more than a reducing it to its former state. It may mean, wilt thou now bestow the kingdom and dominion to Israel, according to the prediction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-27.htm">Daniel 7:27</a>?<p>The kingdom - The dominion; the empire; the reign. The expectation was that the Messiah the king of Israel would reign over people, and that thus the nation of the Jews would extend their empire over all the earth.<p>To Israel - To the Jews, and particularly to the Jewish followers of the Messiah. Lightfoot thinks that this question was asked in indignation against the Jews. "Wilt thou confer dominion on a nation which has just put thee to death?" But the answer of the Saviour shows that this was not the design of the question. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?&#8212;Doubtless their carnal views of Messiah's kingdom had by this time been modified, though how far it is impossible to say.

The kingdom had been for some time taken away from the Jews, Judea was reduced to a Roman province, and was now actually under the power of a Roman governor. And the nation in general was in great expectation, that upon the Messiah's coming they should be delivered from the yoke of the Romans, and that the son of David would be king over them. The disciples of Christ had imbibed the same notions, and were in the same expectation of a temporal kingdom to be set up by their master, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-21.htm">Matthew 20:21</a> and though his sufferings and death had greatly damped their spirits, and almost destroyed their hopes, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm">Luke 24:21</a> yet his resurrection from the dead, and his discoursing with them about the kingdom of God, and ordering them to wait at Jerusalem, the metropolis of that nation, for some thing extraordinary, revived their hopes, and emboldened them to put this question to him: and this general expectation of the Jews is expressed by them in the same language as here, <p>"the days of the Messiah will be the time when  , "the kingdom shall return", or "be restored to Israel"; and they shall return to the land of Israel, and that king shall be exceeding great, and the house of his kingdom shall be in Zion, and his name shall be magnified, and his fame shall fill the Gentiles more than King Solomon; all nations shall be at peace with him, and all lands shall serve him, because of his great righteousness, and the wonderful things which shall be done by him; and whoever rises up against him God will destroy, and he shall deliver him into his hands; and all the passages of Scripture testify of his and our prosperity with him; and there shall be no difference in anything from what it is now, only "the kingdom shall return to Israel" (i). <p>(i) Maimon. in Misn.

And they said to him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost.">Acts 19:2</a> (in Vulgate <span class="ital">si</span>); it is adopted in the LXX, and a parallel may also be found in the interrogative <span class="greekheb">ה</span> in Hebrew (so Blass and Viteau).—<span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ χρόνῳ τούτῳ</span>: such a promise as that made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm" title="For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.">Acts 1:5</a>, the fulfilment of which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm" title="And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions:">Joel 2:28</a>, would mark the salvation of Messianic times, might lead the disciples to ask about the restoration of the kingdom to Israel which the same prophet had foretold, to be realised by the annihilation of the enemies of God and victory and happiness for the good. As in the days of old the yoke of Pharaoh had been broken and Israel redeemed from captivity, so would the Messiah accomplish the final redemption, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>, and set up again, after the destruction of the world-powers, the kingdom in Jerusalem; Weber, <span class="ital">Jüdische Theologie</span>, pp. 360, 361 (1897). No doubt the thoughts of the disciples still moved within the narrow circle of Jewish national hopes: “totidem in hac interrogatione sunt errores quot verba,” writes Calvin. But still we must remember that with these thoughts of the redemption of Israel there mingled higher thoughts of the need of repentance and righteousness for the Messianic kingdom (<span class="ital">Psalms of Solomon</span>, 17, 18; ed. Ryle and James, p. lviii.), and that the disciples may well have shared, even if imperfectly, in the hopes of a Zacharias or a Simeon. Dr. Edersheim notes “with what wonderful sobriety” the disciples put this question to our Lord (<span class="ital">ubi supra</span>, i., p. 79); at the same time the question before us is plainly too primitive in character to have been invented by a later generation (McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 41).—<span class="greekheb">ἀποκαθιστάνεις</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαθιστάνω</span>, a form of <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαθίστημι</span> which is found in classical Greek and is used of the restoration of dominion as here in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/15-3.htm" title="Forasmuch as certain pestilent men have usurped the kingdom of our fathers, and my purpose is to challenge it again, that I may restore it to the old estate, and to that end have gathered a multitude of foreign soldiers together, and prepared ships of war;">1Ma 15:3</a>; see also below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a> and Malachi LXX <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-5.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,">Acts 4:5</a>. On the form of the verb see W.H[101], ii., 162, and on its force see further Dalman, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 109. “Dost thou at this time restore …?” R.V.; the present tense marking their expectation that the kingdom, as they conceived it, would immediately appear—an expectation enhanced by the promise of the previous verse, in which they saw the foretaste of the Messianic kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[101] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">wilt thou … restore</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">dost</span> <span class="ital">thou restore</span> (or <span class="ital">art thou restoring</span>), but the English future gives the sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the kingdom to Israel</span>] The question was asked when all the Apostles were gathered together, so that the enquiry was not dictated by the mistaken notion of some single member. It shews, as do many other remarks and questions (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-21.htm" title="But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel: and beside all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.">Luke 24:21</a>, &c.), how far the Apostles were even yet from comprehending the spirituality and universality of the work to which Christ was sending them. A temporal kingdom confined to Israel is what they still contemplate. The change from the spirit which dictated the question in this verse, to that in which St Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost....">Acts 2:38-39</a>) preached repentance and forgiveness to all whom the Lord should call, is one of the greatest evidences of the miracle of Pentecost.
