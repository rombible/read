The Vulgate, <span class= "ital">convescens, </span>“eating with,” probably rests on a mistaken etymology of the Greek term.

The life begun by the supernatural birth ends with the supernatural Ascension, which sets the seal of Heaven on Christ’s claims and work. Therefore the Gospel ends with it. But it is also the starting-point of the Christ’s heavenly activity, of which the growth of His Church, as recorded in the Acts, is the issue. Therefore the Book of the Acts of the Apostles begins with it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The keynote of the ‘treatise’ lies in the first words, which describe the Gospel as the record of what ‘Jesus <span class="ital">began</span> to do and teach,’ Luke would have gone on to say that this second book of his contained the story of what Jesus went on to do and teach after He was ‘taken up,’ if he had been strictly accurate, or had carried out his first intention, as shown by the mould of his introductory sentence; but he is swept on into the full stream of his narrative, and we have to infer the contrast between his two volumes from his statement of the contents of his first.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The book, then, is misnamed Acts of the Apostles, both because the greater number of the Apostles do nothing in it, and because, in accordance with the hint of the first verse, Christ Himself is the doer of all, as comes out distinctly in many places where the critical events of the Church’s progress and extension are attributed to ‘the Lord.’ In one aspect, Christ’s work on earth was finished on the Cross; in another, that finished work is but the beginning both of His doing and teaching. Therefore we are not to regard His teaching while on earth as the completion of Christian revelation. To set aside the Epistles on the plea that the Gospels contain Christ’s own teaching, while the Epistles are only Paul’s or John’s, is to misconceive the relation between the earthly and the heavenly activity of Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The statement of the theme of the book is followed by a brief summary of the events between the Resurrection and Ascension. Luke had spoken of these in the end of his Gospel, but given no note of time, and run together the events of the day of the Resurrection and of the following weeks, so that it might appear, as has been actually contended that he meant, that the Ascension took place on the very day of Resurrection. The fact that in this place he gives more detailed statements, and tells how long elapsed between the Resurrection Sunday and the Ascension, might have taught hasty critics that an author need not be ignorant of what he does not mention, and that a detailed account does not contradict a summary one,-truths which do not seem very recondite, but have often been forgotten by very learned commentators.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Three points are signalised as occupying the forty days: commandments were given, Christ’s actual living presence was demonstrated {by sight, touch, hearing, etc.}, and instructions concerning the kingdom were imparted. The old blessed closeness and continuity of companionship had ceased. Our Lord’s appearances were now occasional. He came to the disciples, they knew not whence; He withdrew from them, they knew not whither. Apparently a sacred awe restrained them from seeking to detain Him or to follow Him. Their hearts would be full of strangely mingled feelings, and they were being taught by gentle degrees to do without Him. Not only a divine decorum, but a most gracious tenderness, dictated the alternation of presence and absence during these days.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The instructions then given are again referred to in Luke’s Gospel, and are there represented as principally directed to opening their minds ‘that they might understand the Scriptures.’ The main thing about the kingdom which they had then to learn, was that it was founded on the death of Christ, who had fulfilled all the Old Testament predictions. Much remained untaught, which after years were to bring to clear knowledge; but from the illumination shed during these fruitful days flowed the remarkable vigour and confidence of the Apostolic appeal to the prophets, in the first conflicts of the Church with the rulers. Christ is the King of the kingdom, and His Cross is His throne,-these truths being grasped revolutionised the Apostles’ conceptions. They are as needful for us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> From <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a> onwards the last interview seems to be narrated. Probably it began in the city, and ended on the slopes of Olivet. There was a solemn summoning together of the Eleven, which is twice referred to {<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>}. What awe of expectancy would rest on the group as they gathered round Him, perhaps half suspecting that it was for the last time! His words would change the suspicion into certainty, for He proceeded to tell them what they were not to do and to do, when left alone. The tone of leave-taking is unmistakable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The prohibition against leaving Jerusalem implies that they would have done so if left to themselves; and it would have been small wonder if they had been eager to hurry back to quiet Galilee, their home, and to shake from their feet the dust of the city where their Lord had been slain. Truly they would feel like sheep in the midst of wolves when He had gone, and Pharisees and priests and Roman officers ringed them round. No wonder if, like a shepherdless flock, they had broken and scattered! But the theocratic importance of Jerusalem, and the fact that nowhere else could the Apostles secure such an audience for their witness, made their ‘beginning at Jerusalem’ necessary. So they were to crush their natural longing to get back to Galilee, and to stay in their dangerous position. We have all to ask, not where we should be most at ease, but where we shall be most efficient as witnesses for Christ, and to remember that very often the presence of adversaries makes the door ‘great and effectual.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These eleven poor men were not left by their Master with a hard task and no help. He bade them ‘wait’ for the promised Holy Spirit, the coming of whom they had heard from Him when in the upper room He spoke to them of ‘the Comforter.’ They were too feeble to act alone, and silence and retirement were all that He enjoined till they had been plunged into the fiery baptism which should quicken, strengthen, and transform them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The order in which promise and command occur here shows how graciously Jesus considered the Apostles’ weakness. Not a word does He say of their task of witnessing, till He has filled their hearts with the promise of the Spirit. He shows them the armour of power in which they are to be clothed, before He points them to the battlefield. Waiting times are not wasted times. Over-eagerness to rush into work, especially into conspicuous and perilous work, is sure to end in defeat. Till we feel the power coming into us, we had better be still.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The promise of this great gift, the nature of which they but dimly knew, set the Apostles’ expectations on tiptoe, and they seem to have thought that their reception of it was in some way the herald of the establishment of the Messianic kingdom. So it was, but in a very different fashion from their dream. They had not learned so much from the forty days’ instructions concerning the kingdom as to be free from their old Jewish notions, which colour their question, ‘Wilt Thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?’ They believed that Jesus could establish His kingdom when He would. They were right, and also wrong,-right, for He is King; wrong, for its establishment is not to be effected by a single act of power, but by the slow process of preaching the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Our Lord does not deal with their misconceptions which could only be cured by time and events; but He lays down great principles, which we need as much as the Eleven did. The ‘times and seasons,’ the long stretches of days, and the critical epoch-making moments, are known to God only; our business is, not to speculate curiously about these, but to do the plain duty which is incumbent on the Church at all times. The perpetual office of Christ’s people to be His witnesses, their equipment for that function {namely, the power of the Holy Spirit coming on them}, and the sphere of their work {namely, in ever-widening circles, Jerusalem, Samaria, and the whole world}, are laid down, not for the first hearers only, but for all ages and for each individual, in these last words of the Lord as He stood on Olivet, ready to depart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The calm simplicity of the account of the Ascension is remarkable. So great an event told in such few, unimpassioned words! Luke’s Gospel gives the further detail that it was in the act of blessing with uplifted hands that our Lord was parted from the Eleven. Two expressions are here used to describe the Ascension, one of which {‘was taken up’} implies that He was passive, the other of which {‘He went’} implies that He was active. Both are true. As in the accounts of the Resurrection He is sometimes said to have been raised, and sometimes to have risen, so here. The Father took the Son back to the glory, the Son left the world and went to the Father. No chariot of fire, no whirlwind, was needed to lift Him to the throne. Elijah was carried by such agency into a sphere new to him; Jesus ascended up where He was before.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No other mode of departure from earth would have corresponded to His voluntary, supernatural birth. He carried manhood up to the throne of God. The cloud which received Him while yet He was well within sight of the gazers was probably that same bright cloud, the symbol of the Divine Presence, which of old dwelt between the cherubim. His entrance into it visibly symbolised the permanent participation, then begun, of His glorified manhood in the divine glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Most true to human nature is that continued gaze upwards after He had passed into the hiding brightness of the glory-cloud. How many of us know what it is to look long at the spot on the horizon where the last glint of sunshine struck the sails of the ship that bore dear ones away from us! It was fitting that angels, who had heralded His birth and watched His grave, should proclaim His Second Coming to earth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It was gracious that, in the moment of keenest sense of desolation and loss, the great hope of reunion should be poured into the hearts of the Apostles. Nothing can be more distinct and assured than the terms of that angel message. It gives for the faith and hope of all ages the assurance that He will come; that He who comes will be the very Jesus who went; that His coming will be, like His departure, visible, corporeal, local. He will bring again all His tenderness, all His brother’s heart, all His divine power, and will gather His servants to Himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> No wonder that, with such hopes flowing over the top of their sorrow, like oil on troubled waters, the little group went back to the upper room, hallowed by memories of the Last Supper, and there waited in prayer and supplication during the ten days which elapsed till Pentecost. So should we use the interval between any promise and its fulfilment. Patient expectation, believing prayer, harmonious association with our brethren, will prepare us for receiving the gift of the Spirit, and will help to equip us as witnesses for Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me....">Acts 1:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">Being assembled together with them </span>— Namely, at Jerusalem, to which place they had gone to prepare themselves for the feast of pentecost, or rather, in obedience to Christ’s command, who, after he had met them in Galilee, had appointed them to meet him there, that he might spend his last days on earth in that once holy city, doing this last honour to the place where God had chosen to dwell, and where the most solemn ordinances of his worship had been administered.

It was a great honour which Christ did John now, in not only quoting his words, but making this great blessing of the Spirit, soon to be given, to be the accomplishment of them. Thus <span class="ital">he confirmed the word of his servants, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-26.htm" title="That confirms the word of his servant, and performes the counsel of his messengers; that said to Jerusalem, You shall be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, You shall be built, and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:">Isaiah 44:26</a> : but Christ can do more than any of his ministers. It is an honour to them to be employed in dispensing the means of grace, but it is his prerogative to give the Spirit of grace. Now this gift of the Holy Ghost, thus promised, thus prophesied of, thus waited for, is that which the apostles received ten days after, namely, at the approaching pentecost, as is recorded in the next chapter. Several other scriptures speak of the gift of the Holy Ghost to ordinary believers; this speaks of that particular power which, by the Holy Ghost, the first preachers of the gospel, and planters of the church, were endowed with, enabling them infallibly to relate to that age, and record to posterity, the doctrine of Christ, and the proofs of it: so that by virtue of this promise, and the performance of it, we receive the New Testament as of divine inspiration, and venture our souls upon it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do.

This would be a baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And being assembled together - Margin, "or, eating together."

It has the meaning of "congregating, or assembling." It should have been, however, translated in the active sense, "and having assembled them together." The apostles were scattered after his death. But this passage denotes that he had assembled them together by his authority, for the purpose of giving them a charge respecting their conduct when he should have left them.

Therefore <span class="greekheb">ἣν ἠκούσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span> is to be considered as a reference to a former promise of the Spirit, <span class="ital">not recorded by Luke</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-26.htm" title="Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.">Acts 15:26</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">ἀκούειν τί τινος</span>, see Winer, p. 187 [E.

This is grammatically incorrect; it must then have been <span class="greekheb">συναλίζων</span>, or, with logical accuracy (as Luther felt), <span class="greekheb">συναλίσας</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">συναλίζομενος</span>: a strong array of modern commentators renders “eating with them,” following the Vulgate <span class="ital">convescens illis</span> (so both A. and R.V. in margin, and Wycl. and Rhem.). It is thus rendered by Overbeck (as against De Wette), Wendt, Holtzmann, Felten, Weiss, Matthias, Knabenbauer, and Blass, who adopts the reading <span class="greekheb">ὡς συναλ</span>., and regards the particle as showing that the recapitulation is continued of the events already mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-42.htm" title="And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.">Luke 24:42</a> ff. It is evidently taken in the same sense by Spitta, Feine, Jüngst. If we so translate it, we must derive it from <span class="greekheb">ἅλς</span> (salt), so Schol. <span class="greekheb">κοινωνῶν ἁλῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τραπέζης</span>, in the sense given to the expression by Chrys., Theophyl., Œcum.

If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1 Samuel 26:19</a>) is also rendered <span class="greekheb">συναλισθῶ</span> (Alius) as an equivalent of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">אֶלְחַם</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ συμφάγοιμι</span>, Symmachus. Blass gives no classical references, but points out that the word undoubtedly exists in the sense referred to in <span class="ital">Clem. Hom.</span>, xiii., 4 (but see Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>). Hilgenfeld (<span class="ital">Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Theol.</span>, p. 74 (1894)) contends that the use of the word in the psalm quoted and in the passage from the Clementines refers not to the use of salt at an ordinary meal, but rather to the sacrificial and symbolical use of salt in the Old and New Testaments. Thus in the passage <span class="ital">Clem. Hom.</span>, xiii., 4, <span class="greekheb">τότε αὐτοῖς συναλιζόμεθα</span>, <span class="greekheb">τότε</span> means “after the Baptism”; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Ignatius, <span class="ital">ad Magnes.</span>, x., <span class="greekheb">ἁλίσθητε εν αὐτῷ</span>, “be ye salted in him”. Wendt takes the word quite generally as meaning that the sharing in a common meal with His disciples, as on the evening of the Resurrection, was the habitual practice of the Lord during the Forty Days; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-41.htm" title="Not to all the people, but to witnesses chosen before God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.">Acts 10:41</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-36.htm" title="And as they thus spoke, Jesus himself stood in the middle of them, and said to them, Peace be to you.">Luke 24:36</a> ff. Feine similarly holds that the word presupposes some such incidents as those mentioned in Luke 24, and that Luke had derived his information from a source which described the final instructions to the disciples as given at a common meal. On the other hand it must be borne in mind that in classical Greek, as in Herodotus and Xenophon (Wetstein) (as also in Josephus, <span class="ital">B. J.</span>, iii., 9, 4), <span class="greekheb">συναλίζω</span> = to assemble, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Hesychius, <span class="greekheb">συναλιζ</span>. = <span class="greekheb">συναλισθείς</span>, <span class="greekheb">συναχθείς</span>, <span class="greekheb">συναθροισθείς</span>, and it is possible that the preceding present participles in the immediate context may help to account for the use of the same participle instead of the aorist <span class="greekheb">συναλισθείς</span>. The verb is then derived from <span class="greekheb">σύν</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἁλής</span> (<span class="greekheb">ᾱ</span>), meaning lit[99], close, crowded together. Mr. Rendall (<span class="ital">Acts of the Apostles</span>, p. 32) would derive it from <span class="greekheb">Ἁλίη</span> (-<span class="greekheb">α</span>), a common term for a popular assembly amongst Ionian and Dorian Greeks, and he supposes that the verb here implies a general gathering of believers not limited to the Twelve; but the context apparently points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a> to a command which was certainly given only to the Twelve.—<span class="greekheb">παρήγγειλεν</span>, “he charged them,” R.V., which not only distinguishes it from other verbs rendered “to command,” but also gives the emphatic meaning which St. Luke often attaches to the word. It is characteristic of his writings, occurring four times in his Gospel and ten or eleven times in Acts, and it is very frequent in St. Paul’s Epistles (Friedrich, Lekebusch).—<span class="greekheb">Ἱεροσολύμων</span>: a neuter plural (but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-3.htm" title="When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.">Matthew 2:3</a> and Grimm <span class="ital">sub v.</span>). St. Luke most frequently uses the Jewish form <span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>—twenty-seven times in his Gospel, about forty in Acts—as against the use of <span class="greekheb">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span> four times in his Gospel and over twenty in Acts (Friedrich, Lekebusch). Blass retains the aspirate for the Greek form but not for the Jewish, <span class="ital">cf. in loco</span> and <span class="ital">Grammatik des N. G.</span>, pp. 17, 31, but it is very doubtful whether either should have the aspirate; W.H[100], ii., 313; Plummer’s <span class="ital">St. Luke</span>, p. 64; Winer-Schmiedel, p. 93. Grimm points out that the Hebrew form is used in the N.T.: “ubi in ipso nomine tanquam sancta vis quædam reponitur ut, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm" title="For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.">Galatians 4:25</a>; ita in compellationibus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-34.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, which kill the prophets, and stone them that are sent to you; how often would I have gathered your children together, as a hen does gather her brood under her wings, and you would not!">Luke 13:34</a>;” see further <span class="ital">sub v.</span> <span class="greekheb">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ χωρίζ</span>.: it was fitting that they should not depart from Jerusalem, not only that the new law as the old should go forth from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a> (Felten), but that the Apostles’ testimony should be delivered not to men unacquainted with the facts, but to the inhabitants of the city where Jesus had been crucified and buried. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ δὲ εὐθὺς ἐχωρίσθησαν Ἱεροσολύμων</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τούτων οὐδὲν ἐπηκολούθησεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὕποπτος ἄν ἡ ἀνάστασις ὑπῆρξεν</span>, Œcumenius, <span class="ital">in loco;</span> see also Theophyl.—<span class="greekheb">περιμένειν</span>: not elsewhere in N.T. (but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-24.htm" title="And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius waited for them, and he had called together his kinsmen and near friends.">Acts 10:24</a>, ), but used in classical Greek of awaiting a thing’s happening (Dem.). The passage in LXX in which it occurs is suggestive: <span class="greekheb">τὴν σωτηρίαν περιμένων κυρίου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm" title="I have waited for your salvation, O LORD.">Genesis 49:18</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-12.htm" title="When I hold my tongue, they shall bide my leisure, and when I speak, they shall give good ear unto me: if I talk much, they shall lay their hands upon their mouth.">Wis 8:12</a>). On the tradition that the Apostles remained in Jerusalem for twelve years in obedience to a command of the Lord, and the evidence for it, see Harnack, <span class="ital">Chronologie</span>, i., p. 243 ff. Harnack speaks of the tradition as very old and well attested, and maintains that it is quite in accordance with Acts, as the earlier journeys of the Apostles are there described as missionary excursions from which they always returned to Jerusalem.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐπαγγελίαν</span>: Bengel notes the distinction between <span class="greekheb">ὑπισχνέομαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγέλλομαι</span>, the former being used of promises in response to petitions, the latter of voluntary offers (Ammonius): “quæ verbi Græci proprietas, ubi de divinis promissionibus agitur, exquisite observanda est”. It is therefore remarkable that in the Gospels the word <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελία</span> is never used in this technical sense of the divine promise made by God until <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>, where it is used of the promise of the Holy Spirit, as here. But in Acts and in St. Paul’s Epistles and in the Hebrews the word is frequent, and always of the promises made by God (except <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-21.htm" title="But do not you yield to them: for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, which have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and now are they ready, looking for a promise from you.">Acts 23:21</a>).

The importance of their keeping together until the Holy Ghost was given is clear. It would thus be made more manifest that, though hereafter scattered abroad, their inspiration was supplied from one common source. To the Jews, to whom the Apostles were first to speak, this would appeal, because their own prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm" title="And many people shall go and say, Come you, and let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:3</a>) had said “Out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye have heard of me</span>] This promise is alluded to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-49.htm" title="And, behold, I send the promise of my Father on you: but tarry you in the city of Jerusalem, until you be endued with power from on high.">Luke 24:49</a>) and found in St John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>), “I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever.” “The Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, shall teach you all things,” &c. “He shall testify of me.” Thus were they to be prepared as witnesses for Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-4.htm" title="And, being assembled together with them, commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard of me.">Acts 1:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συναλιζόμενος</span>, <span class="ital">having a meeting with</span> them[1]) This is not said of all His appearances, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm" title="To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:">Acts 1:3</a>, but of the last, and that, a meeting attended by a large number, and one of the greatest moment.

V. and Rev. give eating together in margin, following the derivation from &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, together, and &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c2;, salt: eating salt together, and hence generally of association at table.<p>Commanded (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Originally to pass on or transmit; hence, as a military term, of passing a watchword or command; and so generally to command.<p>To wait for (&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here in New Testament.<p>The promise (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Signifying a free promise, given without solicitation. This is the invariable sense of the word throughout the New Testament, and this and its kindred and compound words are the only words for promise in the New Testament. &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, meaning to promise in response to a request, does not occur; and &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-7.htm">Matthew 14:7</a>, of Herod promising Salome, really means to acknowledge his obligation for her lascivious performance.

Not after many, but after a few. </body></html>
