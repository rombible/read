The words threw the disciples back upon their recollection of their first admission to the Kingdom. Some of them, at least, must have remembered also the teaching which had told them of the new birth of water and of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3-5</a>). Now they were told that their spirits were to be as fully baptised, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>plunged, into the power of the Divine Spirit, as their bodies had then been plunged in the waters of the Jordan. And this was to be “not many days hence.” The time was left undefined, as a discipline to their faith and patience. They were told that it would not be long, lest faith and patience should fail.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-5 Our Lord told the disciples the work they were to do. The apostles met together at Jerusalem; Christ having ordered them not to depart thence, but to wait for the pouring out of the Holy Spirit. This would be a baptism by the Holy Ghost, giving them power to work miracles, and enlightening and sanctifying their souls. This confirms the Divine promise, and encourages us to depend upon it, that we have heard it from Christ; for in Him all the promises of God are yea and amen.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For John truly baptized ... - These are the words of Jesus to his apostles, and he evidently has reference to what was said of John's baptism compared with his own in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a>.

Or "in water", as he himself says, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a> John's baptism was water baptism, an immersion of persons in water: he was the first administrator of it, and therefore is here mentioned by name; and his, and the baptism of the Spirit, are opposed; for there were others, as the disciples of Christ, that baptized in water as well as John: and these words are not to be understood of the words of the Lord, by the mouth of John, which the disciples heard, for they were not then called when John spoke the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a> nor indeed are they the same with these; but these are the words of Christ himself, and which the apostles heard from his own mouth, as is clear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm">Acts 11:16</a> though they are not recorded by any of the evangelists; and these are not the only words which Luke repeats, that the evangelists are silent about; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a>. <p>but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost; that is, by himself; for it is Christ's prerogative to baptize with the Spirit, as John foretold of him, and it designs such an extraordinary and plentiful donation of the gifts of the Spirit, as may be expressed by a baptism; in which the apostles, on the day of "Pentecost", were, as it were, to be immersed, and with them covered; as Cyril of Jerusalem (h) observes, <p>"as he,    , "who is plunged in water, and baptized", is encompassed by the water on every side, so are they that are wholly baptized by the Spirit. <p>Not many days hence; within ten days, for this was on the fortieth day from his death, which was at the passover, these words were said; and on the fiftieth day from thence was the feast of Pentecost, when this had its fulfilment, <p>(h) Cateches. 17. sect. 8. p. 247. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.</span><p>(d) Either by the Father, or by me: so that either the Father or Christ is set here contrasted with John, as the Holy Spirit is contrasted with water, as things that are comparable to one another.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm" title="For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.">Acts 1:5</a>.

St. Peter refers to this saying of the Lord's in his address to the Church of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-16.htm">Acts 11:16</a>), and the record of it here may be an indication that St. Luke derived his information of these early events from Peter. A curious question arises as to the baptism of the apostles themselves. When were they baptized, and by whom? Chrysostom says, "They were baptized by John." But it is evident, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-22.htm">John 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-1.htm">John 4:1, 2</a>, that converts were baptized with Christian, as distinct from John's, baptism in our Lord's lifetime, and hence it may seem probable, especially considering that St. Paul was baptized, that the apostles may have been baptized by Christ (Bishop Wordsworth On <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-2.htm">John 4:2</a>). If so, the baptism with the Holy Ghost at Pentecost was the complement of that baptism, not the substitute for it. "In our case," says Chrysostom, "both (the baptism of water and of the Spirit) take place under one act, but then they were divided." </body></html>
