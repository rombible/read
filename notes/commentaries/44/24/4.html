The eloquence of Tertullus was as bad as his cause; a lame introduction, a lame transition, and a lame conclusion! Did not God confound the orator’s language? <span class="ital">I pray that thou wouldest hear </span>— What we have to offer; <span class="ital">of thy clemency </span>— With thy usual candour and well-known goodness. <span class="ital">For we have found this man a pestilent fellow </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">a pestilence, </span>or <span class="ital">plague, </span>as <span class="greekheb">λοιμος </span>signifies; a man infecting others with pernicious principles, and spreading mischief wherever he comes; <span class="ital">and a mover of sedition among all the Jews </span>— Rendering them disaffected to the government, and exciting them to rise in rebellion against it; <span class="ital">and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes </span>— A term of reproach, which, it seems, was given to the disciples of Christ even at that early period. <span class="ital">Who also hath gone about to profane the temple </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By bringing heathen into it. “Tertullus artfully mentions this, as the most express fact he had to charge upon him, as he knew that the Romans allowed the Jews a power of executing, even without forms of law, any person who should be found in such an act of profanation; and he seems to have intended to make a merit of their moderation, that they intended, nevertheless, fairly to have tried him, and not to have destroyed him on the spot, as Lysias had justly charged them with attempting to do. And it is observable, that Tertullus nowhere expressly avows so much as a design to have put Paul to death, though it was undoubtedly intended.” — Doddridge. Thus, after a fawning preface, Tertullus prefers charges against Paul, for which there was not the shadow of a foundation, except that he was a leading person among the Nazarenes, or Christians. For that he had moved the Jews to sedition against the government, or that he went about to profane the temple, was utterly false; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm" title="Crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men every where against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.">Acts 21:28</a>;) and so it was also, that they <span class="ital">took him to judge him according to their law; </span>for they took him by violence, and drew him out of the temple, and went about to kill him without any judicial process. In short, the whole accusation, together with the circumstances by which the orator aggravated it, were all mere fictions, of which he offered no proof whatever, only that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-9.htm" title="And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.">Acts 24:9</a>) <span class="ital">the Jews </span>— Namely, the high-priest and the elders; <span class="ital">assented, saying that these things were so.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 See here the unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is, to have their services praised beyond measure, and never to be faithfully told of their faults; hereby they are hardened and encouraged in evil, like Felix. God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be not further tedious unto thee - By taking up your time with an introduction and with commendation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4.
