It is noticeable that this is the only mention in the Acts of that which occupies so prominent a place in the Epistles of this period. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1Corinthians 16:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;">2Corinthians 8:1-4</a>.) The manifestly undesigned coincidence between the Acts and the Epistles on this point has naturally often been dwelt on by writers on the evidences which each supplies to the other. The “offerings” were the sacrifices which the Apostle was about to offer on the completion of the Nazarite vow with which he had associated himself. There is, perhaps, a refined courtesy in St. Paul’s use of the word “nation” (commonly used only of the heathen) instead of the more usual “people.” He avoids the term which would have implied a certain assumption of superiority to the magistrate before whom he stood. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-32.htm" title="And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divides his sheep from the goats:">Matthew 25:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings....">Acts 24:17-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now after many years, </span>&c. — They have represented me as a profane and lawless person, as if I had thrown contempt upon religion, and done them a great deal of wrong; but so far have I been from doing any thing to injure the Jews, to whom by birth I belong, or from attempting to profane the temple, as these my enemies falsely pretend, that I have given many public and important proofs of my particular regard for the good of my country, and of the veneration that I have for all that is sacred. Accordingly, <span class="ital">after </span>several <span class="ital">years — </span>Which I had spent in other parts; <span class="ital">I came to bring alms to </span>the poor of <span class="ital">my nation </span>— Which I had been collecting for them in the Gentile provinces where I had any interest; <span class="ital">and offerings </span>— To God, which I proposed to make by assisting some Nazarites to discharge their vow, according to the law; <span class="ital">whereupon </span>— At the very time when I was thus employed; <span class="ital">certain Jews from Asia </span>— Who raised the first outcry against me; <span class="ital">found me purified in the temple — </span>That is, performing such things as the law required, and in which the legal purification of Nazarites consisted; <span class="ital">neither with multitude </span>— Attending me; <span class="ital">nor with tumult </span>— Made by me; the multitude being of their own gathering together, and the tumult, if any, being made by themselves. So that there was no colour for the charge brought against him, but evidence sufficient against it. And it was very unreasonable and hard, 1st, To accuse him as an enemy to their nation, when, after long absence from Jerusalem, he came to bring alms to it, money which he had collected among his friends for the relief of the poor at Jerusalem; and, 2d, To accuse him of having profaned the temple, when he brought offerings to the temple, and was found purifying himself therein, according to the law, and that in a very quiet and orderly manner. And as to what was, perhaps, suggested to Felix, that he had brought Greeks into the temple contrary to their law, he challenges them to prove it. Those Jews of Asia, says he, who were the causes of all the tumult, confusion, and violent proceedings, <span class="ital">ought to have been here before thee — </span>As being the only proper witnesses of the facts, if there were any which could justify their laying violent hands upon me. These, however, were now absent, probably because they knew they could not make good their charge against him, and were conscious of having injured him by their accusation; and doubtless Felix so understood it. As for the other Jews, they could only testify on the report of others, or give hear-say evidence, which could not be sufficient in any cause or court. <span class="ital">Or else let these same here say </span>— Paul is willing to allow the validity of the testimony of the Jews present, about such things as they themselves had been eye or ear witnesses of, namely, of what had passed in the council when Paul was brought before it; <span class="ital">if they have found any evil-doing in me</span> — Any crime committed by me, or any thing done or said, for which I merit punishment. <span class="ital">Except it be for this one voice </span>— As if he had said, Let them object, if they can, any other fault; <span class="ital">that I cried, standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question — </span>Which, nevertheless, was the real truth. And, if my affirming it be a fault for which I must suffer, I acknowledge it, and there needs no other proof. But as that was one of the great articles of the national faith, he could not be blamed, either for maintaining it, or for asserting that God had given a proof of it, in the resurrection of Jesus from the dead.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:10-21 Paul gives a just account of himself, which clears him from crime, and likewise shows the true reason of the violence against him. Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now after many years - After many years' absence. Paul here commences a reply to the charge of Tentullus, that he had endeavored to profane the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm">Acts 24:6</a>. He begins by saying that his design in coming up to Jerusalem was to bring to his countrymen needed aid in a time of distress. It would be absurd to suppose, therefore, that his object in coming was to violate the customs of the temple, and to defile it.<p>I came to bring - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29-30</a>; compare the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-26</a>.<p>Alms - Charities; the gift of the churches.<p>To my nation - Not to all the nation, but to the poor saints or Christians who were in Judea, and who were suffering much by persecutions and trials.<p>And offerings - The word used here properly denotes "an offering or gift" of any kind; but it is usually applied to an oblation or offering made to God in the temple - "a thank-offering, a sacrifice." This is probably its meaning here. He came to bring aid to his needy countrymen, and an offering to God; and it was, therefore, no part of his purpose to interfere with, or to profane the worship of the temple. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.
