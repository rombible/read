Assuming them to be part of the speech, they are an endeavour to turn the tables on Lysias by representing him as the real disturber of the peace.

God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus!

But in spite of this it is very difficult to see how the advocate could have avoided some allusion to the circumstances mentioned in these words. Of course he puts the matter in a light most favourable to the Jews. “We would have judged him according to our law” is very different language from that in which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-27.htm" title="This man was taken of the Jews, and should have been killed of them: then came I with an army, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.">Acts 23:27</a>) Lysias describes Paul as in danger to be killed by the Jews. The action of Lysias too is described by Tertullus as one of great violence. Probably the Roman soldiers would not handle the mob tenderly. But Tertullus is trying to cast blame upon the chief captain and to represent his party as doing all things according to law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">according to our law</span>] Tertullus identifies himself, advocate-like, with the Jews whose mouthpiece he is.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm" title="Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.">Acts 24:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπείρασε</span>, <span class="ital">attempted</span>) This verb may be understood of a mere attempt, or else of an effectual effort: therefore it was a term suited for creating odium.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> <span class="accented">- Moreover assayed</span> for <span class="accented">also hath gone about</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">on whom also we laid hold</span> for <span class="accented">whom we took</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">To profane the temple</span>.
