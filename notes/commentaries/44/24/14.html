Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But this I confess ... - The next specification in the charge of Tertullus was <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a> that he was "a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes." To this, Paul replies in this and the two following verses. Of this reply we may observe:<p>(1) That he does not stoop to notice the contempt implied in the use of the word "Nazarenes." He was engaged in a more important business than to contend about the name which they chose to give to Christians.<p>(2) he admits that he belonged to that sect or class of people. That he was a Christian he neither denied, nor was disposed to deny.<p>(3) he maintains that in this way he was still worshipping the God of his fathers. Of this, the fact that he was engaged in worship in the temple was sufficient proof.<p>(4) he shows them that he believed only what was written in the Law and the prophets; that this involved the main doctrine of their religion the hope of the resurrection of the dead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm">Acts 24:15</a>; and that it was his constant and earnest desire to keep a pure conscience in all things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>. These are the points of his defense to the second charge, and we shall see that they fully meet and dispose of the accusation.<p>After the way - After the manner or mode of worship.<p>Which they call heresy - This translation does not express to us the force of the original. We have attached to the word "heresy" an idea which is not conveyed by the Greek word, since we now commonly understand by it error of doctrine. In Paul's answer here, there is an explicit reference to their charge which does not appear in our version. The charge of Tertullus was, that he was the ringleader of the sect (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  te&#772;s haireseo&#772;s) of the Nazarenes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>. To this Paul replies, "After the way which they call "sect" &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  hairesin, not error of doctrine, but after a way which they affirm is producing division or schism), so worship I the God of my fathers." Paul was hot ashamed to be called a follower of that sect or party among the Jewish people. Nor should we be ashamed to worship God in a mode that is called heresy or schism, if we do it in obedience to conscience and to God.<p>So worship I-- I continue to worship. I have not departed from the characteristic of the Jewish people, the proper and public acknowledgment of the God of the Jews.<p>The God of my fathers - My father's God, Yahweh; the God whom my Jewish ancestors adored. There is something very touching in this, and suited to find its way to the heart of a Jew. He had introduced no new object of worship (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-1.htm">Deuteronomy 13:1-5</a>); he had not become a follower of a false or foreign God; and this fact was really a reply to their charge that he was setting up a new sect in religion. The same thing Paul affirms of himself in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm">2 Timothy 1:3</a>; "I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with a pure conscience."<p>Believing all things ... - Particularly respecting the Messiah. So he more fully explains his meaning in his speech before King Agrippa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-23.htm">Acts 26:23</a>.<p>In the law and in the prophets - Commanded in the Law of Moses, and foretold by the prophets. That Paul had ever disbelieved any of these things they could not prove; and his whole course had shown that he fully credited the sacred records. Most of his arguments in defending Christianity had been drawn from the Jewish writings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14, 15. But this I confess to thee&#8212;in which Felix would see no crime.<p>that after the way they call heresy&#8212;literally, and better, "a sect."<p>so worship I the God of my fathers&#8212;the ancestral God. Two arguments are contained here: (1) Our nation is divided into what they call sects&#8212;the sect of the Pharisees, and that of the Sadducees&#8212;all the difference between them and me is, that I belong to neither of these, but to another sect, or religious section of the nation, which from its Head they call Nazarenes: for this reason, and this alone, am I hated. (2) The Roman law allows every nation to worship its own deities; I claim protection under that law, worshipping the God of my ancestors, even as they, only of a different sect of the common religion.<p>believing all, &c.&#8212;Here, disowning all opinions at variance with the Old Testament Scriptures, he challenges for the Gospel which he preached the authority of the God of their fathers.

Yet he does withal truly assert, that he worshipped no other God than the God of his fathers, but worshipped him whom Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (whom they so much gloried in) had worshipped; and that he had no other religion than what was taught in the law and the prophets, from whom they themselves had received theirs. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But this I confess unto thee,....

Gamaliel the elder, he approving of it; which R. Gamaliel was Paul's master; and some have thought, that Samuel the little, the composer of this prayer, was Saul himself; so that he knew very well that the Christian doctrine was called heresy, and the Christians heretics, for he had called them so himself in the time of his unregeneracy; but now he was not ashamed to profess that way, and walk in it, and according to it worship God, as follows: <p>so worship I the God of my fathers; even Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, suggesting, that by embracing Christianity, he had not denied, and gone off from the worship of the one, only, living, and true God, the God of Israel; and that there was an entire agreement between the saints of the Old Testament, and the Christians of the New, in the object of worship; the Vulgate Latin version reads, "so serve I the Father, and my God"; that is, God the Father, who is the Father of Christ, and the God and Father of believers in him: <p>believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets; which the Sadducees did not; and strictly adhering to these, and not to the traditions of the elders, as did the Scribes and Pharisees; so that since he believed whatever was contained in the sacred writings, he could not be charged justly with heresy; and as he believed, so he taught nothing but what was agreeably to the Scriptures of the Old Testament. <p>(r) Ganz Tzemach David, par. 1. fol. 25. 2.

St Paul employs the expression “the Way,” in that sense in which it soon became well known, to signify “the Christian religion.” See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so worship I the God of my fathers</span>] Better, as <span class="ital">Rev.

Here the notion is of service which a man is bound to pay. The Apostle means that he has cast off no morsel of his old allegiance. The adjective can equally be rendered by “<span class="ital">my</span> fathers” or “<span class="ital">our</span> fathers,” but St Paul’s aim is to shew that he has not severed himself from the ancestral faith of the whole nation, and so his thought would include himself with them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">believing all things which are written in the law and the prophets</span>] The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gives very literally “all things which are according to the Law, and which are written in the Prophets.” The Apostle thus testifies to his complete acceptance of all the Jewish Scriptures. Sometimes the division is given as “the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a>), but more frequently, as in the text, only two sections are named (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm" title="Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-13.htm" title="For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.">Matthew 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-40.htm" title="On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.">Matthew 22:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm" title="The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presses into it.">Luke 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁμολογῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I confess</span>) A forensic word, and one also used in sacred things, and appropriately employed here.

He had said all that was required for his defence; but now, skilfully making a handle of the opportunity, he adds a confession of faith.—<span class="greekheb">πατρῷῳ</span>) Paul confutes the prejudice as to the <span class="ital">newness</span> of Christianity.—<span class="greekheb">νόμον</span>, in <span class="ital">the law</span>) Again he refutes Tertullus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm" title="Who also has gone about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would have judged according to our law.">Acts 24:6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">γεγραμμένοις</span>, <span class="ital">written</span>) concerning Jesus of Nazareth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm" title="For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:">Acts 24:5</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="accented">A</span> <span class="accented">sect</span> for <span class="accented">heresy</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">serve</span> for <span class="accented">worship</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">our</span> for <span class="accented">my</span>, A.V.

The word <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, which means primarily "choice," has not necessarily or even ordinarily a bad sense. In classical Greek its secondary sense was a "sect" or "school" of philosophy, Academics, Peripatetics, Stoics, Epicureans, etc. The Jews applied it to their own different schools of thought. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm">Acts 5:17</a> we read, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> sect of the Sadducees;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>, <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> sect of the Pharisees;" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm">Acts 26:5</a> St. Paul speaks of himself as having been a Pharisee, <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f35;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "After the straitest sect of our religion" (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm">Acts 28:22</a>). It begins to have a bad sense in St. Paul's Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-19.htm">1 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f31;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, where, however, it gets its bad sense from the <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> joined to it). In ecclesiastical writers it came to have its worst sense of "heresy" <span class="accented">as</span> something worse even than "<span class="accented">schism."</span> In this reference to Tertullus's phrase, St. Paul seems hardly to admit that Christianity was properly called "a sect" by the Jews, but gives it the milder term of "the Way" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">The God of our [my] father</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1ff7;</span>); comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-14.htm">Galatians 1:14</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm">Acts 28:17</a>. Observe how St. Paul throughout insists that, in becoming a Christian, he had not been disloyal to Moses, or the Law, or the prophets, or to the religion of his fathers, but quite the contrary. <span class="cmt_word">According to the Law</span>. <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> may mean either, as in the R.V., "according to the Law," or, as Meyer takes it, "throughout the Law," and then is better coupled, as in the A.V., with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>. <span class="cmt_word">The Law, and... the prophets</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27, 44</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The way<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>.<p>A sect<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-5.htm">Acts 24:5</a>.

Thus Demosthenes calls Apollo the &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; (ancestral god) of Athens. Socrates is asked (Plato, "Euthydemus," 302), "Have you an ancestral Zeus (&#x396;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)?" So, frequently, in the classics. Similarly, the Roman phrase, Di patrii, "the gods of the forefathers." On the Roman reverence for the ancestral religion, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-21.htm">Acts 16:21</a>. The Roman's own sentiment would prepare him to respect Paul's. </body></html>
