Let us never be driven from any good way by its having an ill name. It is very comfortable, in worshipping God, to look to him as the God of our fathers, and to set up no other rule of faith or practice but the Scriptures. This shows there will be a resurrection to a final judgment. Prophets and their doctrines were to be tried by their fruits. Paul's aim was to have a conscience void of offence. His care and endeavour was to abstain from many things, and to abound in the exercises of religion at all times; both towards God. and towards man. If blamed for being more earnest in the things of God than our neighbours, what is our reply? Do we shrink from the accusation? How many in the world would rather be accused of any weakness, nay, even of wickedness, than of an earnest, fervent feeling of love to the Lord Jesus Christ, and of devotedness to his service! Can such think that He will confess them when he comes in his glory, and before the angels of God? If there is any sight pleasing to the God of our salvation, and a sight at which the angels rejoice, it is, to behold a devoted follower of the Lord, here upon earth, acknowledging that he is guilty, if it be a crime, of loving the Lord who died for him, with all his heart, and soul, and mind, and strength. And that he will not in silence see God's word despised, or hear his name profaned; he will rather risk the ridicule and the hatred of the world, than one frown from that gracious Being whose love is better than life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because that thou mayest understand - Greek: "Thou being able to know." That is, he could understand or know by taking the proper evidence. Paul does not mean to say that Felix could understand the case because he had been many years a judge of that nation. That fact would qualify him to judge correctly, or to understand the customs of the Jews. But the fact that he himself had been but twelve days in Jerusalem, and had been orderly and peaceable there, Felix could ascertain only by the proper testimony. The first part of Paul's defense <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm">Acts 24:11-13</a> consists in an express denial of what they alleged against him.<p>Are yet but twelve days - Beza reckons these twelve days in this manner: The first was that on which he came to Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-15.htm">Acts 21:15</a>. The second he spent with James and the apostles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>. Six days were spent in fulfilling his vow, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm">Acts 21:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-26.htm">Acts 21:26</a>. On the ninth day the tumult arose, being the seventh day of his vow, and on this day he was rescued by Lysias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm">Acts 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-29.htm">Acts 22:29</a>. The tenth day he was before the Sanhedrin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>. On the eleventh the plot was laid to take his life, and on the same day, at evening, he was removed to Caesarea. The days on which he was confined at Caesarea are not enumerated, since his design in mentioning the number of days was to show the improbability that in that time he had been engaged in producing a tumult; and it would not be pretended that he had been so engaged while confined in a prison at Caesarea. The defense of Paul here is, that but twelve days elapsed from the time that he went to Jerusalem until he was put under the custody of Felix; and that during so short a time it was wholly improbable that he would have been able to excite sedition.<p>For to worship - This further shows that the design of Paul was not to produce sedition. He had gone up for the peaceful purpose of devotion, and not to produce riot and disorder. That this was his design in going to Jerusalem, or at least a part of his purpose, is indicated by the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-16.htm">Acts 20:16</a>. It should be observed, however, that our translation conveys an idea which is not necessarily in the Greek that this was the design of his going to Jerusalem. The original is, "Since I went up to Jerusalem worshipping" &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  proskune&#772;so&#772;n; that is, he was actually engaged in devotion when the tumult arose. But his main design in going to Jerusalem was to convey to his suffering countrymen there the benefactions of the Gentile churches.

Continuance of the vow, interrupted by the arrest (Ac 21:27, &c.); 7. Arrest of Paul (Ac 21:27); 8. Paul before the Sanhedrim (Ac 22:30; 23:1-10); 9.

And of these twelve days he was a prisoner nine, and therefore could not have done so much mischief, and stirred up so much sedition as was insinuated; and in opposition to the charge of profaning the temple, he observes that he came up to Jerusalem to "worship"; namely, at the feast of Pentecost. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/24.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm" title="Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.">Acts 24:11</a>.

T. 343]. As to the <span class="ital">reckoning of the twelve days</span>, it is to be observed: (1) That by the present <span class="greekheb">εἰσι</span> the inclusion of the days already spent at Caesarea is imperatively required. Hence the assumption of Heinrichs, Hildebrand, and others is to be rejected as decidedly erroneous: “Dies, quibus P. jam Caesareae fuerat, non numerantur; ibi enim (!!) in custodia tumultum movere non poterat” (Kuinoel). (2) That <span class="greekheb">οὐ πλείους εἰσι</span> permits us to regard as the current day on which the discussion occurred, either the twelfth or the (not yet elapsed) thirteenth; as, however, Paul wished to express as short a period as possible, the latter view is to be preferred. There accordingly results the following calculation:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Day of arrival in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-15.htm" title="And after those days we took up our carriages, and went up to Jerusalem....">Acts 21:15-17</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Meeting with James, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm" title="And the day following Paul went in with us to James; and all the elders were present.">Acts 21:18</a> ff. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>III. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Undertaking of the Nazarite vow and offerings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-26.htm" title="Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.">Acts 21:26</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IV. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>V. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The seven days’ time of offering broken off by the arrest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VI. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VII. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Arrest of the apostle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a> ff. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VIII. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul before the Sanhedrim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm" title="On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.">Acts 22:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day....">Acts 23:1-10</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IX. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jewish conspiracy and its disclosure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a> ff.

It is not necessary therefore to include the day of the arrival in Jerusalem (<span class="greekheb">ἀφʼ ἧς</span> points to the day as something past, Bethge), or the day of the present trial; probably the arrival in Jerusalem was in the evening, as it is not until the next day that Paul seeks out James (Wendt). The first day of the twelve would therefore be the entry in to James, the second the commencement of the Nazirite vow, the sixth that of the apprehension of Paul towards the close of the seven days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-27.htm" title="And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews which were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,">Acts 21:27</a>; the seventh the day before the Sanhedrim, the eighth the information of the plot and (in the evening) Paul’s start for Cæsarea, the ninth the arrival in Cæsarea; and, reckoning from the ninth five days inclusively, the day of the speech of Tertullus before Felix would be the thirteenth day, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, twelve full days; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm" title="And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them to Troas in five days; where we stayed seven days.">Acts 20:6</a>, where in the seven days are reckoned the day of arrival and the day of departure (Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). Meyer on the other hand reckons the day of St. Paul’s arrival in Jerusalem as the first day, and the five days of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-1.htm" title="And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.">Acts 24:1</a> from his departure from Jerusalem for Cæsarea. For other modes of reckoning see Wendt’s note, Farrar, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, ii., 338, Alford, Rendall, and Lumby, <span class="ital">in loco</span>.

There were other reasons no doubt for St. Paul’s journey, as he himself states, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm" title="But now I go to Jerusalem to minister to the saints.">Romans 15:25</a>, but he naturally places first the reason which would be a defence in the procurator’s eyes. Overbeck and Wendt contend that the statement is not genuine, and that it is placed by the author of Acts in St. Paul’s mouth, but see on the other hand Weiss, <span class="ital">in loco</span>. It seems quite captious to demand that Paul should explain to the procurator all the reasons for his journey, or that the fact that he came to worship should exclude the fact that he also came to offer alms.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">because that thou mayest understand</span>] <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> taking a slightly different reading, “Seeing that thou canst take knowledge.” The Apostle means that it was easy to find evidence about all that had happened in such a short space of time. Beside which Felix’s knowledge of Jewish customs would tell him that this was just the time at which foreign Jews came to Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that there are yet but twelve days</span>] The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> has the more modern English, which is also closer to the Greek, “that it is not more than twelve days.” The time may be accounted for thus: the day of St Paul’s arrival, the interview with James on the second day, five days may be given to the separate life in the temple during the vow, then the hearing before the council, next day the conspiracy, the tenth day St Paul reached Cæsarea, and on the thirteenth day (which leaves five days (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-1.htm" title="And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.">Acts 24:1</a>), as Jews would reckon from the conspiracy to the hearing in Cæsarea) St Paul is before Felix. See Farrar’s <span class="ital">St Paul</span>, ii. 338 (note).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship</span>] The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gets rid of the antiquated English by rendering, “since I went up to worship at Jerusalem.” But the A. V. gives more of the emphasis which St Paul intended to lay on the object of his visit. He went on purpose to worship. Was it likely that he would try to profane the temple? And the verb which he uses expresses all the lowly adoration common among Orientals. The Apostle probably chose it for this reason. He would have Felix know that it was in a most reverent frame of mind that he came to the feast.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-11.htm" title="Because that you may understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship.">Acts 24:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δεκαδύο</span>, <span class="ital">twelve</span>) Deducting the five days, of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-1.htm" title="And after five days Ananias the high priest descended with the elders, and with a certain orator named Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.">Acts 24:1</a> speaks, there were seven days: and concerning these seven see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-17.htm" title="And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly....">Acts 21:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-26.htm" title="Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them....">Acts 21:26-27</a> (the <span class="ital">seven</span> days of purification were nearly ended <span class="greekheb">ἔμελλον συντελεῖσθαι</span>, when he was made prisoner), wherein the verb <span class="greekheb">ἔμελλον</span> should be attended to; and the sense is, When these things were being done, which Paul had taken in hand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-26.htm" title="He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul, that he might loose him: why he sent for him the oftener, and communed with him.">Acts 24:26</a> : furthermore see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm" title="On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.">Acts 22:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome....">Acts 23:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-32.htm" title="On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle:">Acts 23:32</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνέβην</span> <span class="ital">I went up</span>) from Cesarea.
