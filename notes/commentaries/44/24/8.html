Tertullus apparently suggests that the judge should interrogate the prisoner—perhaps, by using a technical term, with a well-understood significance, that he should examine him by scourging, or some other mode of torture. Strictly speaking, the “examination” of Which Tertullus speaks was a preliminary inquiry, previous to the actual trial, to ascertain whether there were sufficient grounds for further proceedings. It will be observed that he keeps back the fact of St. Paul’s being a Roman, and it does not follow that Tertullus knew that Lysias had informed Felix of it. It is possible, however, after all, if we admit the genuineness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-7.htm" title="But the chief captain Lysias came on us, and with great violence took him away out of our hands,">Acts 24:7</a>, that the relative pronoun may refer to Lysias and not to the Apostle; and this agrees with the language of Felix in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-9 See here the unhappiness of great men, and a great unhappiness it is, to have their services praised beyond measure, and never to be faithfully told of their faults; hereby they are hardened and encouraged in evil, like Felix. God's prophets were charged with being troublers of the land, and our Lord Jesus Christ, that he perverted the nation; the very same charges were brought against Paul. The selfish and evil passions of men urge them forward, and the graces and power of speech, too often have been used to mislead and prejudice men against the truth. How different will the characters of Paul and Felix appear at the day of judgement, from what they are represented in the speech of Tertullus! Let not Christians value the applause, or be troubled at the revilings of ungodly men, who represent the vilest of the human race almost as gods, and the excellent of the earth as pestilences and movers of sedition.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Commanding his accusers ... - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-30.htm">Acts 23:30</a>.<p>By examining of whom - That is, the Jews who were then present. Tertullus offered them as his witnesses of the truth of what he had said. It is evident that we have here only the summary or outline of the speech which he made It is incredible that a Roman rhetorician would have on such an occasion delivered an address so brief, so meagre, and so destitute of display as this. But it is doubtless a correct summary of his address, and contains the leading points of the accusation. It is customary for the sacred writers, as for other writers, to give only the outline of discourses and arguments. Such a course was inevitable, unless the New Testament had been swelled to wholly undue proportions. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

But this was not done till after Paul had set forth his case before the people, upon the stairs leading to the castle: and after he had pleaded his own cause before the sanhedrim; and after the chief captain had had intelligence of the Jews lying in wait to kill him: Tertullus would insinuate that the captain was blameworthy, that he hindered a legal process against Paul; and that it was owing to him, that this trouble was given the governor, as well as the high priest and elders, who by his orders came down from Jerusalem to Caesarea; and that had it not been for him this affair might have been finished with more dispatch, and less trouble. <p>By examining of whom; not the accusers, but either the chief captain, as some think, or rather Paul: <p>thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things whereof we accuse him; so impudent was Tertullus, and of such effrontery and assurance, that he feared not to say, that the governor, by examining Paul himself, would easily come to the knowledge of the things he was accused of, and plainly see that he was guilty of them; so that there would be no need of their attestations, or of producing witnesses against him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Commanding his accusers to come unto thee: by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-8.htm" title="Commanding his accusers to come to you: by examining of whom yourself may take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.">Acts 24:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνακ</span>.: not an examination by torture, which could not be legally applied either to Paul or to Lysias as Roman citizens, but in the sense of a judicial investigation—in this sense peculiar to Luke, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-9.htm" title="And he brought him to Jerusalem, and set him on a pinnacle of the temple, and said to him, If you be the Son of God, cast yourself down from hence:">Luke 4:9</a>, and Plummer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm" title="Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:">Luke 23:14</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-26.htm" title="Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord.

V. the relative “whom” is here naturally referred to “accusers.” A glance at the Greek shews that this cannot be, for it is in the singular number. The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gives the literal rendering of the passage thus, “<span class="ital">From whom thou wilt be able, by examining him thyself. to take knowledge</span>, &c.” If the supposed interpolation be accepted as text, then “whom” and “him” would most properly be referred to Lysias. Felix might on the arrival of the chief captain question him and learn the truth of what had taken place. And with this the remark of Felix in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a> fits in, “When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.” If however the doubtful words be rejected, then the pronouns must refer to St Paul. But it is curious, to say the least, that Tertullus should suggest to Felix that the truth of his case should be supported by an examination of the person accused. It has therefore been suggested that the word rendered “examining” has regard to some process of torture by which a prisoner might be forced to confess the truth. But for this no sufficient support has been found. The noun derived from this verb is employed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-26.htm" title="Of whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord. Why I have brought him forth before you, and specially before you, O king Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write.">Acts 25:26</a>) for the inquiry before Agrippa.
