And, to make this computation evident: From the birth of Isaac to the birth of Jacob, are sixty years; from thence to their going into Egypt, one hundred and thirty; from thence to their coming out, two hundred and ten; from thence to their entrance into the land of Canaan, forty; and from thence to the division of the land, the time wherein it had rest, (about which time, it is probable, they began to settle their government by judges,) seven years; which, altogether, make up four hundred and forty-seven.

The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had destroyed - Subdued, cast out, or extirpated them as nations.

It is difficult to say what is the meaning of the R.T. in regard to the four hundred and fifty years, what is the terminus a <span class="accented">quo</span> or <span class="accented">ad quem</span> intended by it. The usual explanations of the reading of the R.T. (adopted by Lachman, Bishop Wordsworth, and others) is that the years are dated from the birth of Isaac, and that the meaning is that the promise to give the land to the seed of Abraham was actually performed within four hundred and fifty years (<span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>) (after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>), which gives a good sense and is not at all improbable (see Bishop Wordsworth's note). The reading of the T.R. has grave objections on the score of chronology as well as grammar. Duration of time is expressed by the accusative case, as vers. 18 and 21; the measure of time in which a thing is done by the dative. So that the natural rendering of the T.R. would be that he gave them judges four hundred and fifty years after the entrance into Canaan; which of course cannot be the meaning. The other objection is that, if the times of the judges from the final conquest of the land to the judgeship of Samuel was four hundred and fifty years, the whole time from the Exodus to the building of the temple must have been about six hundred and forty years (37 from death of Moses to Othuiel + 450, + 30 for judgeship of Samuel, + 40 of Saul's reign, + 40 for David's reign, +3 years of Solomon, + and the 40 years in the wilderness), whereas <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-1.htm">1 Kings 6:1</a> gives the time as four hundred and eighty years; while the genealogies suppose a much shorter time - about two hundred and eighty years. It is an immense gain, therefore, to get rid of this four hundred and fifty years for the time of the judges, and by the well-supported reading of the R.T. to get a calculation in agreement with <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> and with the chronology of the times. <span class="cmt_word">Gave them... for an inheritance</span>. The T.R. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, the R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, which words are not infrequently interchanged in different codices of the LXX.
