It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he, whom God raised again - The Lord Jesus.<p>Saw no corruption - Was raised without undergoing the usual change that succeeds death. As David had returned to corruption, and the Lord Jesus had not, it followed that this passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a> referred to the Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36. For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God&#8212;rather, "served," in his own generation, the will (or "counsel") of God; yielding himself an instrument for the accomplishment of God's high designs, and in this respect being emphatically "the man after God's own heart." This done, he "fell asleep, and was gathered to his fathers, and saw corruption." David, therefore (argues the apostle), could not be the subject of his own prediction, which had its proper fulfilment only in the resurrection of the uncorrupted body of the Son of God, emphatically God's "Holy One."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God raised again; </span> that is, on the third day, according to the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saw no corruption; </span> was not under the power of death so long as to be preyed upon so far by it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But he whom God raised again,.... The Vulgate Latin version adds, "from the dead"; meaning the Lord Jesus Christ, who was raised from the dead by God the Father: and <p>saw no corruption; he did not lie so long in the grave as to corrupt and putrefy, but was raised from the dead the third day; wherefore the passage, before cited, is very applicable to him, and is a clear proof that the Messiah was to rise from the dead, as Jesus did. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-37.htm" title="But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.">Acts 13:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἤγειρεν</span>: more than resurrection from the dead, “hic non notatur resuscitatio ex mortuis; quippe quæ ipsa in conclusione evincitur: sed <span class="ital">quem Deus suscitavit</span> est <span class="ital">Sanctus Dei</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm" title="Why he said also in another psalm, You shall not suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 13:35</a>, ut hæc Subjecti descriptio contineat ætiologiam,” Bengel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/13.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-37.htm" title="But he, whom God raised again, saw no corruption.">Acts 13:37</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἤγειρε</span>, <span class="ital">raised up</span>) Here there is not denoted the resurrection from the dead [as Engl.
