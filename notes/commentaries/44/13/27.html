The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because they knew him not - The statement in this verse is designed, not to reproach the Jews at Jerusalem, but to introduce the fact that Jesus had died, and had risen again. With great wisdom and tenderness, Paul speaks of the murderers of the Saviour in such a manner as not to exasperate, but, as far as possible, to mitigate their crime. There was sufficient guilt in the murder of the Son of God to fill the nation with alarm, even after all that could be said to mitigate the deed. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-36.htm">Acts 2:36-37</a>. When Paul says, "They knew him not," he means that they did not know him to be the Messiah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-8.htm">1 Corinthians 2:8</a>); they were ignorant of the true meaning of the prophecies of the Old Testament; they regarded him as an impostor. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm">Acts 3:17</a>.<p>Nor yet the voices of the prophets - The meaning of the predictions of the Old Testament respecting the Messiah.

Though the Scriptures were read so constantly, yet they were ignorant of their true meaning. They were blinded by pride, and prejudice, and preconceived opinions.

For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, &c.&#8212;The apostle here speaks as if the more immediate guilt of Christ's death lay with the rulers and people of the metropolis, to which he fondly hoped that those residing at such a distance as Antioch would not set their seal.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They; </span> the common people, and <span class="bld">their rulers; </span> great council, both had a hand in our Saviour’s death.

In accordance with the contrast: <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἱ κατοικοῦντες ἐν Ἱερουσ</span>., the logical sequence is: “<span class="ital">To you</span> was the doctrine of salvation sent; for <span class="ital">in Jerusalem</span> the Saviour has been rejected;” therefore the preaching must be brought to <span class="ital">those outside</span> in the <span class="greekheb">διασπορά</span>, such as <span class="ital">you</span> are. It does not conflict with this view, that at all events the preaching would come to them as Jews (objection of de Wette); since the fundamental idea rather is, that, because Jerusalem has despised Christ, now in place of the inhabitants of Jerusalem the <span class="ital">outside</span> Jews primarily are destined for the reception of salvation. They are to step <span class="ital">into the place of those</span> as regards this reception of salvation; and the announcement of salvation, which was <span class="ital">sent</span> to them, was <span class="ital">withdrawn</span> from those and their rulers, the members of the Sanhedrim, on account of the rejection of the Saviour. Thus there is in <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> the idea of divine <span class="ital">retribution</span>, exercised against the seat of the theocracy, and resulting in good to those outside at a distance (comp. <span class="greekheb">τοῖς εἰς μακράν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>); the idea of a <span class="ital">Nemesis</span>, by which those afar off are <span class="ital">preferred</span> to the nearest children of the kingdom. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-43.htm" title="Therefore say I to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof.">Matthew 21:43</a>. Most of the older commentators are silent on <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span> here. According to Erasmus, it is <span class="ital">admonitory</span>, according to Calvin, <span class="ital">exhortatory</span> to yet greater compliance; but in this case the special point must first be read between the lines. Contrary to the contrast of <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">οἱ κατοικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσ</span>., <span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>, according to de Wette, is designed to introduce the <span class="ital">exposition of the idea of</span> <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>; according to Baumgarten, to convey the hint that the <span class="ital">informal</span> (?) <span class="ital">way</span>, outwardly considered, in which the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> had reached Antioch, had its reason in the fact that the centre of the theocracy had resisted Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦτον ἀγνοήσαντες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">not having known Him</span> (i.e. <span class="ital">Jesus</span>, as the self-evident subject), <span class="ital">they have also</span> (<span class="greekheb">καί</span>, the <span class="ital">also</span> of the corresponding relation) <span class="ital">fulfilled by their sentence</span> (by the condemnation of Jesus) <span class="ital">the voices of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath day</span>.

And in consequence of their rejection, you, who had no share in crucifying the Lord of glory, are invited to take their place. But it maybe taken as expressing the cause why this salvation is complete and capable of being offered to them. This salvation is preached to you because, through the instrumentality of those that dwell at Jerusalem, all that was written in the Scriptures concerning Christ has been fulfilled. Christ has been crucified and raised from the dead, and so now remission of sins is proclaimed to you through him (vers. 38, 39; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm">Acts 3:13-20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which are read every sabbath</span>.
