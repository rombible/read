David was such at that time, but not at all times. And he was so in the respect here mentioned: he performed <span class="ital">all God’s will </span>— In the particulars there spoken of. But he was not <span class="ital">a man after God’s own heart </span>in other respects, wherein he performed his own will. In the matter of Uriah, for instance, he was as far from being <span class="ital">a man after God’s own heart, </span>as Saul himself was. It is, therefore, a very gross, as well as dangerous mistake, to suppose this is the character of David in every part of his behaviour. We must beware of this, unless we would recommend adultery and murder as <span class="ital">things after God’s own heart.” </span>So Mr. Wesley: and in the same sense Dr. Benson understands the words, observing, “when it is said that King David was <span class="ital">a man after God’s own heart, </span>it ought to be understood of his public, not of his private character. He was a man <span class="ital">after God’s own heart, </span>because he ruled his people Israel according to the divine will. He did not allow of idolatry; he did not set up for absolute power; he was guided in the government of the nation by the law of Moses, as the standing rule of government, and by the prophet, or the divine oracle, whereby God gave directions upon particular emergencies. That this was the meaning of David’s being <span class="ital">a man after God’s own heart, </span>will easily appear by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-28.htm" title="And Samuel said to him, The LORD has rent the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, that is better than you.">1 Samuel 15:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/28-17.htm" title="And the LORD has done to him, as he spoke by me: for the LORD has rent the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David:...">1 Samuel 28:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/9-13.htm" title="And their brothers, heads of the house of their fathers, a thousand and seven hundred and three score; very able men for the work of the service of the house of God....">1 Chronicles 9:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:">Psalm 78:70</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-20.htm" title="I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I anointed him:">Psalm 89:20</a>, &c.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:14-31 When we come together to worship God, we must do it, not only by prayer and praise, but by the reading and hearing of the word of God. The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And afterward they desired a king - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>.

See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a>.<p>By the space of forty years - During forty years. The Old Testament has not mentioned the time during which Saul reigned. Josephus says (Antiq., book 6, chapter 14, section 9) that he reigned for 18 years while Samuel was alive, and 22 years after his death. But Dr. Doddridge (note in loco) has shown that this cannot be correct, and that he probably reigned, as some copies of Josephus have it, but two years after the death of Samuel. Many critics suppose that the term of 40 years mentioned here includes also the time in which Samuel judged the people. This supposition does not violate the text in this place, and may be probable. See Doddridge and Grotius on the place. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

This computation of St. Paul might also agree more with the Septuagint, and be according to the then current account, which (not being of more consequence) St. Paul would not controvert at this time, having greater matters to speak of unto them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And afterward they desired a king,.... <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a> which the Jews (w) say, was in the tenth year of Samuel; that is, of his government over Israel, or of his judging them: <p>and God gave unto them Saul; whose name signifies one that is asked; he was <p>the son of Cis; so the Septuagint read and pronounce the word "Kish", the name of Saul's father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-1.htm">1 Samuel 9:1</a> a man of the tribe of Benjamin; not of Judah, from whence the sceptre was not to depart till Shiloh came; the business of their asking a king being resented by God, he gives them their first king of another tribe: <p>by the space of forty years. The Jews are very much divided about the years of Saul's reign, some allow him but two years (x), and others three, one year that he reigned with Samuel, and two by himself (y), which they conclude from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> but others (z) think this too short a time for the things done by him, the wars he fought with many nations, and his persecution of David from place to place; wherefore others (a) allow him, some seventeen, and others twenty years; but our apostle ascribes forty years to him, which must be understood both of him and Samuel; with which Josephus (b) agrees, who says that he reigned eighteen years, during Samuel's life, and twenty two years after his death, which make the space of forty years fixed by the apostle; though the clause, "by the space of forty years", may be read in construction with the latter end of the preceding verse, until Samuel the prophet; who, the Jews (c) own, judged so many years: wherefore the apostle is not to be charged with an error, as he is by a Jewish (d) objector; who observes, that from the beginning of Saul's kingdom, or from the time that he was anointed by Samuel the prophet, until the kingdom was renewed to him by all Israel, was one year, and then Saul chose three thousand men out of Israel after that he reigned two years by the consent of all Israel, until he sinned in the business of the Amalekites, and then he was accounted as a dead man, and the years of his reign were not numbered; at which time David was anointed, who must be about twenty years of age, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a> and yet when he came to the kingdom after the death of Saul, he was but thirty years of age, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-4.htm">2 Samuel 5:4</a> from whence he thinks it follows that Saul reigned but ten years: in all which he is guilty of several mistakes, and advances things he cannot prove; it was not after Saul had reigned one year, but after he had reigned two years, that he chose three thousand men out of Israel, as is expressly said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm">1 Samuel 13:1</a> and that he had reigned but two years when he sinned in the case of the Amalekites, wants proof; nor is it evident that David was twenty years of age when he was anointed, for it was after his unction that he is said to be a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a> nor indeed can it be said in what year of Saul's reign he was anointed; so that nothing can be concluded from the age David was at when he began to reign, concerning the years of the reign of Saul his predecessor; and even according to this man's own reckoning, he must reign thirteen years, one before the consent of all Israel, two after, and before his sin about the Amalekites, and ten from the time of David's unction: but that Saul must reign more years than these, and even as many as the apostle assigns to him, may be concluded, not only from his wars with many nations, and his long persecution of David before observed; but from the number of high priests which were in his time, and who were no less than three, Ahiah, Abimelech, and Abiathar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-3.htm">1 Samuel 14:3</a> and from his being a young man when he began to reign, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a> and yet at the end of his reign, or at his death, he had a son, Ishbosheth, that was forty years of age, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm">2 Samuel 2:10</a>. <p>(w) T.
