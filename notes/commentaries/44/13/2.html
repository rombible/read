In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm" title="Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation?">Hebrews 1:14</a>, the corresponding adjective is used to distinguish the ministry of worship from that of service to man. When St. Paul uses it figuratively of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>), it is in connection with the idea of a sacrifice or oblation. In later ecclesiastical language, it was connected specially with the celebration of the Supper of the Lord, and the order for that service was, strictly speaking, <span class= "ital">the</span> “Liturgy” of the Church. It would, perhaps, be too much to say that the word necessarily conveys that meaning here; but it is, at least, probable that a solemn meeting, such as is here described, would end in the “breaking of bread,” and that, up to that point, those who were so engaged would naturally be fasting.<p><span class= "bld">The Holy Ghost said.</span>—The mode of communication we may believe to have been, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>, through the lips of the prophets, speaking as by a sudden burst of simultaneous inspiration. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-18.htm" title="This charge I commit to you, son Timothy, according to the prophecies which went before on you, that you by them might war a good warfare;">1Timothy 1:18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Separate me Barnabas and Saul.</span>—In the Greek a particle follows the imperative, which has no exact equivalent in English (the illative “then” being, perhaps, the nearest), but which seems to indicate that the command given was in answer to a prayer, and that it was to be acted on at once. The verb implies that they were to be set apart for a new work. Up to this time they had been among the prophets and teachers of the Church. Now they were to receive a solemn visible mission, following on the inspired utterances, as those had followed on personal intimations, consecrating them to the work of the Apostleship to the Gentiles.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-3 What an assemblage was here! In these names we see that the Lord raises up instruments for his work, from various places and stations in life; and zeal for his glory induces men to give up flattering connexions and prospects to promote his cause. It is by the Spirit of Christ that his ministers are made both able and willing for his service, and taken from other cares that would hinder in it. Christ's ministers are to be employed in Christ's work, and, under the Spirit's guidance, to act for the glory of God the Father. They are separated to take pains, and not to take state. A blessing upon Barnabas and Saul in their present undertaking was sought for, and that they might be filled with the Holy Ghost in their work. Whatever means are used, or rules observed, the Holy Ghost alone can fit ministers for their important work, and call them to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As they ministered to the Lord - It is probable that this took place on some day set apart for fasting and prayer. The expression "ministered to the Lord" means as they were engaged in prayer to the Lord, or as they were engaged in divine service. The Syriac thus renders the passage.<p>The Holy Ghost said - Evidently by direct revelation.<p>Separate me - Set apart to me, or for my service. It does not mean to ordain, but simply to designate, or appoint to this specific work.<p>For the work whereunto I have called them - Not the apostolic office, for Saul was called to that by the express revelation of Jesus Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/1-12.htm">Galatians 1:12</a>, and Barnabas was not an apostle. The "work" to which they were now set apart was that of preaching the gospel in the regions round about Antioch. It was not any permanent office in the church, but was a temporary designation to a missionary enterprise in extending the gospel, especially through Asia Minor, and the adjacent regions. Accordingly, when, in the fulfillment of this appointment, they had traveled through Seleucia, Cyprus, Paphos, Pamphylia, Pisidia, etc., they returned to Antioch, having fulfilled the work to which they were separated. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm">Acts 14:26-27</a>. "Whereunto I have called them." This proves that they received their commission to this work directly from God the Holy Spirit. Paul and Barnabas had been influenced by the Spirit to engage in this work, but they were to be sent forth by the concurrence and designation of the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Note.&#8212;While the personality of the Holy Ghost is manifest from this language, His supreme divinity will appear equally so by comparing it with Heb 5:4.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ministered; </span> the word importeth the exercise of any public office, sacred or civil.

That is, the five prophets and teachers before mentioned; and whose ministry lay in preaching the Gospel, teaching the people the doctrines of it, and expounding prophecies, and also in prayer; to which latter the Syriac version restrains their ministry, rendering it, "as they prayed to God"; but the phrase seems to be more extensive: "and fasted"; which the Jews were much used to, and the believing ones had not yet left it off; their custom was to fast on Mondays and Thursdays: See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>. Whether it was on one of those days, that these men were ministering and fasting, is not certain; but this we may be sure of, it was not on the Jewish sabbath, for on that day they never fasted; very likely that this was a fast appointed and fixed among themselves, on some particular occasion; it may be on account of the famine, which was at this time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-28.htm">Acts 11:28</a>. <p>The Holy Ghost said; either with an articulate voice, or by an internal impulse, upon the minds of three of the prophets: <p>separate me Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called them; the work which the Holy Ghost had appointed, and called them to before this, was to go and preach the Gospel among the Gentiles, distinct from the Jews, of which we read in the latter part of this chapter; and now he would have them be separated from their brethren, as Aaron and his sons were from theirs, and be sent forth from hence directly, upon that work: this shows the Spirit to be a person, since speaking and commanding in an authoritative way, and calling to a work, are ascribed unto him; and that he is a divine person, and truly God, and equal with God, since calling to a sacred office is attributed to him; and a separation to it is ordered for himself, for his service, honour, and glory; he does not say separate them to the Lord, or to God, but to me. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As they <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> called them.</span><p>(b) While they were busy doing their office, that is, as Chrysostom expounds it, while they were preaching.<p>(c) The Lord is said to call, from which this word called comes from, which is common in the Church, when he causes that to be which was not, whether you refer it to the matter itself, or to any quality or thing about the matter: and the use of the word call has come about because when things begin to be, then they have some name: and furthermore this also declares God's mighty power, in that he spoke the word, and things were made.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/13.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm" title="As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.">Acts 13:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λειτουργούντων</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῷ Κυρίῳ</span>] <span class="greekheb">λειτουργεῖν</span>, the usual word for the temple-service of the priests (LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-31.htm" title="And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue.">Exodus 28:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-38.htm" title="And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon, throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,">Numbers 4:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-38.htm" title="For the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys.">Exodus 40:38</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/4-14.htm" title="And Joacim the high priest, and all the priests that stood before the Lord, and they which ministered unto the Lord, had their loins girt with sackcloth, and offered the daily burnt offerings, with the vows and free gifts of the people,">Jdt 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm" title="And every priest stands daily ministering and offering oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins:">Hebrews 10:11</a>; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are.

In the Old Testament the LXX. use it as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b5;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>, to minister (often with the addition "to God," or "to the Lord "), which is a general word applying to the ministrations of priests and Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-35.htm">Exodus 28:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-26.htm">Numbers 8:26</a>, etc.). Hence its use in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-11.htm">Hebrews 10:11</a> (see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>). Joshua too is called Moses'minister (<span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5ea;</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-1.htm">Joshua 1:1</a>, etc., and the angels are called <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, "ministering spirits" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-14.htm">Hebrews 1:14</a>). Just as the Church transferred from the Jewish congregation so many other words and things, so also the use of the words <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>, to Sicily "Divine service," without specifying the particular office, whether prayer, or preaching, or Holy Communion, or ordination, or any ether part of the worship of God. Its classical use was to designate any office performed by an individual for the public good. Hence in the New Testament its application to Church alms (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>), to gifts for the support of the ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>), to the office of magistrates (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-6.htm">Romans 13:6</a>), etc. The restricted application of the term <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> to the service used in the celebration of the Eucharist was of much later growth, as is evident from Chrysostom explaining the word here of preaching. "What means ministering? Preaching" (Hom. 27.). It seems to have arisen from the fact that the first forms of prayer were those come posed for the office of the Holy Communion. This passage, therefore, does not give the slightest support to fasting Communion. What was the exact occasion of the service and fast here spoken of it is impossible to say. <span class="cmt_word">The Holy Ghost said</span>, etc. This is the origin of the question in the Ordination of Deacons, "Do you trust that you are inwardly moved by the Holy Ghost to take upon you this office?" <span class="cmt_word">Separate me</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The act of separation, or ordination, would be by the laying on of the hands of Symeon and Lucius and Manaen, as Chrysostom says (at least of the two last named), in the presence of the whole Church, but the separation by the Holy Ghost, at least as regards Saul (<span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;</span>), bad been from his mother's womb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>). Observe, too, the <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-15.htm">Galatians 1:15</a>, and the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> here. This is another instance of the very close resemblance between parts of the Acts and the Epistle to the Galatians, which looks as if St. Paul was writing it about the same time as he was giving to St. Luke the details of his own history (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-19.htm">Acts 8:19</a>, note). The ordination was to the apostolate (Chrysostom). Barnabas and Saul are never called apostles till after their ordination or consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-14.htm">Acts 14:14</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Ministered (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>See on the kindred noun ministration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>.
