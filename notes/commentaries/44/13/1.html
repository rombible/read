The former implies a more direct message from God, coming from the Holy Ghost; the latter a more systematic instruction, in which reason and reflection bore their part.<p><span class= "bld">Simeon that was called Niger.</span>—The name seems to indicate the swarth-complexion of Africa; but nothing more is known of him. The epithet was given to him, probably, to distinguish him from the many others of the same name, possibly, in particular, from Simon of Cyrene. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Lucius of Cyrene.</span>—Probably one of the company of “men of Cyprus and Cyrene” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>) who had been among the first evangelists of Antioch. On the ground that Cyrene was famous for its School of Medicine, some writers have identified him with the author of the Acts, but the two names Lucius and Lucas are radically distinct, the latter being contracted for Lucanus.<p><span class= "bld">Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">the foster-brother of Herod.</span> Here we enter on a name that has historical associations of some interest. In the early youth of Herod the Great, his future greatness had been foretold by an Essene prophet of the name of Menahem or Manaen (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xv. 10, § 5). When the prediction was fulfilled, he sought to show honour to the prophet. The identity of name makes it probable that the man who now meets us was the son, or grandson, of the Essene, and that Herod had had him brought up with Antipas as a mark of his favour. Both Antipas and Archelaus were educated at Rome, and Manaen may therefore have accompanied them thither. By what steps he was led to believe in Jesus as the Christ, we can only conjecture; but it seems probable that the austere type of life, so closely resembling that of the Essenes, which was presented by the Baptist, may have impressed him, as he was living in the court of his early companion, and that, through him, he may have been led on to the higher truth, and, in due time, after the Day of Pentecost, have become a sharer in the prophetic gift. The fact that Herod the Great had adorned the city of Antioch with a long and stately colonnade may, perhaps, have given him a certain degree of influence there.<p><span class= "bld">And Saul.</span>—The position of Saul’s name at the end of the list seems to indicate that it was copied from one which had been made before he had become the most prominent of the whole company of the prophets.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/acts/13.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">TO THE REGIONS BEYOND<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm" title="Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.">Acts 13:13</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We stand in this passage at the beginning of a great step forward. Philip and Peter had each played a part in the gradual expansion of the church beyond the limits of Judaism; but it was from the church at Antioch that the messengers went forth who completed the process. Both its locality and its composition made that natural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The solemn designation of the missionaries is the first point in the narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The church at Antioch was not left without signs of Christ’s grace and presence. It had its band of ‘prophets and teachers.’ As might be expected, four of the five named are Hellenists,-that is, Jews born in Gentile lands, and speaking Gentile languages. Barnabas was a Cypriote, Simeon’s byname of Niger {‘Black’} was probably given because of his dark complexion, which was probably caused by his birth in warmer lands. He may have been a North African, as Lucius of Cyrene was. Saul was from Tarsus, and only Manaen remains to represent the pure Palestinian Jew. His had been a strange course, from being foster-brother of the Herod who killed John to becoming a teacher in the church at Antioch. Barnabas was the leader of the little group, and the younger Pharisee from Tarsus, who had all along been Barnabas’s <span class="ital">protege</span>, brought up the rear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The order observed in the list is a little window which shows a great deal. The first and last names all the world knows; the other three are never heard of again. Immortality falls on the two, oblivion swallows up the three. But it matters little whether our names are sounded in men’s ears, if they are in the Lamb’s book of life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These five brethren were waiting on the Lord by fasting and prayer. Apparently they had reason to expect some divine communication, for which they were thus preparing themselves. Light will come to those who thus seek it. They were commanded to set apart two of their number for ‘the work whereunto I have called them.’ That work is not specified, and yet the two, like carrier pigeons on being let loose, make straight for their line of flight, and know exactly whither they are to go.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> If we strictly interpret Luke’s words {‘I <span class="ital">have</span> called them’}, a previous intimation from the Spirit had revealed to them the sphere of their work. In that case, the <span class="ital">separation</span> was only the recognition by the brethren of the divine appointment. The inward call must come first, and no ecclesiastical designation can do more than confirm that. But the solemn designation by the Church identifies those who remain behind with the work of those who go forth; it throws responsibility for sympathy and support on the former, and it ministers strength and the sense of companionship to the latter, besides checking that tendency to isolation which accompanies earnestness. To go forth on even Christian service, unrecognised by the brethren, is not good for even a Paul.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But although Luke speaks of the Church sending them away, he takes care immediately to add that it was the Holy Ghost who ‘sent them forth.’ Ramsay suggests that ‘sent them away’ is not the meaning of the phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-3.htm" title="And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.">Acts 13:3</a>, but that it should be rendered ‘gave them leave to depart.’ In any case, a clear distinction is drawn between the action of the Church and that of the Spirit, which constituted Paul’s real commission as an Apostle. He himself says that he was an Apostle, ‘not from men, neither through man.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The events in the first stage of the journey are next summarily presented. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Note the local colouring in ‘went <span class="ital">down</span> to Seleucia,’ the seaport of Antioch, at the mouth of the river. The missionaries were naturally led to begin at Cyprus, as Barnabas’s birthplace, and that of some of the founders of the church at Antioch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, for the first time, the Gospel went to sea, the precursor of so many voyages. It was an ‘epoch-making moment’ when that ship dropped down with the tide and put out to sea. Salamis was the nearest port on the south-eastern coast of Cyprus, and there they landed,- Barnabas, no doubt, familiar with all he saw; Saul probably a stranger to it all. Their plan of action was that to which Paul adhered in all his after work,-to carry the Gospel to the Jew first, a proceeding for which the manner of worship in the synagogues gave facilities. No doubt, many such were scattered through Cyprus, and Barnabas would be well known in most.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They thus traversed the island from east to west. It is noteworthy that only now is John Mark’s name brought in as their attendant. He had come with them from Antioch, but Luke will not mention him, when he is telling of the sending forth of the other two, because Mark was not sent by the Spirit, but only chosen by his uncle, and his subsequent defection did not affect the completeness of their embassy. His entirely subordinate place is made obvious by the point at which he appears.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nothing of moment happened on the tour till Paphos was reached. That was the capital, the residence of the pro-consul, and the seat of the foul worship of Venus. There the first antagonist was met. It is not Sergius Paulus, pro-consul though he was, who is the central figure of interest to Luke, but the sorcerer who was attached to his train. His character is drawn in Luke’s description, and in Paul’s fiery exclamation. Each has three clauses, which fall ‘like the beats of a hammer.’ ‘Sorcerer, false prophet, Jew,’ make a climax of wickedness. That a Jew should descend to dabble in the black art of magic, and play tricks on the credulity of ignorant people by his knowledge of some simple secrets of chemistry; that he should pretend to prophetic gifts which in his heart he knew to be fraud, and should be recreant to his ancestral faith, proved him to deserve the penetrating sentence which Paul passed on him. He was a trickster, and knew that he was: his inspiration came from an evil source; he had come to hate righteousness of every sort.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Paul was not flinging bitter words at random, or yielding to passion, but was laying the black heart bare to the man’s own eyes, that the seeing himself as God saw him might startle him into penitence. ‘The corruption of the best is the worst.’ The bitterest enemies of God’s ways are those who have cast aside their early faith. A Jew who had stooped to be a juggler was indeed causing God’s ‘name to be blasphemed among the Gentiles.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> He and Paul each recognised in the other his most formidable foe. Elymas instinctively felt that the pro-consul must be kept from listening to the teaching of these two fellow-countrymen, and ‘sought to <span class="ital">pervert</span> him from the faith,’ therein <span class="ital">perverting</span> {the same word is used in both cases} ‘the right ways of the Lord’; that is, opposing the divine purpose. He was a specimen of a class who attained influence in that epoch of unrest, when the more cultivated and nobler part of Roman society had lost faith in the old gods, and was turning wistfully and with widespread expectation to the mysterious East for enlightenment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So, like a ship which plunges into the storm as soon as it clears the pier-head, the missionaries felt the first dash of the spray and blast of the wind directly they began their work. Since this was their first encounter with a foe which they would often have to meet, the duel assumes importance, and we understand not only the fulness of the narrative, but the miracle which assured Paul and Barnabas of Christ’s help, and was meant to diffuse its encouragement along the line of their future work. For Elymas it was chastisement, which might lead him to cease to pervert the ways of the Lord, and himself begin to walk in them. Perhaps, after a season, he did see ‘the better Sun.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Saul’s part in the incident is noteworthy. We observe the vivid touch, he ‘fastened his eyes on him.’ There must have been something very piercing in the fixed gaze of these flashing eyes. But Luke takes pains to prevent our thinking that Paul spoke from his own insight or was moved by human passion. He was ‘filled with the Holy Ghost,’ and, as His organ, poured out the scorching words that revealed the cowering apostate to himself, and announced the merciful punishment that was to fall. We need to be very sure that we are similarly filled before venturing to imitate the Apostle’s tone.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The shifting of the scene to the mainland presents some noteworthy points. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>It is singular that there is no preaching mentioned as having been attempted in Perga, or anywhere along the coast, but that the two evangelists seem to have gone at once across the great mountain range of Taurus to Antioch of Pisidia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A striking suggestion is made by Ramsay to the effect that the reason was a sudden attack of the malarial fever which is endemic in the low-lying coast plains, and for which the natural remedy is to get up among the mountains. If so, the journey to Antioch of Pisidia may not have been in the programme to which John Mark had agreed, and his return to Jerusalem may have been due to this departure from the original intention. Be that as it may, he stands for us as a beacon, warning against hasty entrance on great undertakings of which we have not counted the cost, no less than against cowardly flight from work, as soon as it begins to involve more danger or discomfort than we had reckoned on.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> John Mark was willing to go a-missionarying as long as he was in Cyprus, where he was somebody and much at home, by his relationship to Barnabas; but when Perga and the climb over Taurus into strange lands came to be called for, his zeal and courage oozed out at his finger-ends, and he skulked back to his mother’s house at Jerusalem. No wonder that Paul ‘thought not good to take with them him who withdrew from them.’ But even such faint hearts as Mark’s may take courage from the fact that he nobly retrieved his youthful error, and won back Paul’s confidence, and proved himself ‘profitable to him for the ministry.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">There were in the church at Antioch certain prophets and teachers </span>— Some of them, it seems, the stated pastors of the church, and some only occasionally resident there: Paul and Barnabas were of the latter. <span class="ital">Manaen, </span>who <span class="ital">had been brought up with Herod </span>— His foster- brother, now freed from the temptations of a court. <span class="ital">As they ministered to the Lord </span>— Which all diligent faithful teachers do: for while they minister to the church in praying and preaching (both which are here included) they minister also <span class="ital">unto the Lord, </span>being the servants of the people for Jesus’s sake, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants for Jesus' sake.">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>,) and having a continual regard to him in all their ministrations; engaging in, and prosecuting them from a principle of love to him, in obedience to his will, and with an eye to his glory. <span class="ital">And fasted </span>— Religious fasting should not be neglected, in our ministering to the Lord; it being both a sign of our humiliation and a means of our mortification.

In these names we see that the Lord raises up instruments for his work, from various places and stations in life; and zeal for his glory induces men to give up flattering connexions and prospects to promote his cause. It is by the Spirit of Christ that his ministers are made both able and willing for his service, and taken from other cares that would hinder in it. Christ's ministers are to be employed in Christ's work, and, under the Spirit's guidance, to act for the glory of God the Father. They are separated to take pains, and not to take state. A blessing upon Barnabas and Saul in their present undertaking was sought for, and that they might be filled with the Holy Ghost in their work. Whatever means are used, or rules observed, the Holy Ghost alone can fit ministers for their important work, and call them to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The church that was at Antioch - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a>.<p>Certain prophets - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>.<p>And teachers - Teachers are several times mentioned in the New Testament as an order of ministers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>.

"Though Christianity had already spread beyond the limits of Palestine, still the Church continued a stranger to formal missionary effort. Casual occurrences, particularly the persecution at Jerusalem (Ac 8:2), had hitherto brought about the diffusion of the Gospel. It was from Antioch that teachers were first sent forth with the definite purpose of spreading Christianity, and organizing churches, with regular institutions (Ac 14:23)" [Olshausen].<p>1. there were &#8230; certain prophets&#8212;(See on [2000]Ac 11:27).<p>and teachers; as Barnabas, &c.&#8212;implying that there were others there, besides; but, according to what appears the true reading, the meaning is simply that those here mentioned were in the Church at Antioch as prophets and teachers.<p>Simeon &#8230; Niger&#8212;of whom nothing is known.<p>Lucius of Cyrene&#8212;(Ac 2:20). He is mentioned, in Ro 16:21, as one of Paul's kinsmen.<p>Manaen&#8212;or Menahem, the name of one of the kings of Israel (2Ki 15:14).<p>which had been brought up with&#8212;or, the foster brother of.<p>Herod the tetrarch&#8212;that is, Antipas, who was himself "brought up with a certain private person at Rome" [Josephus, Antiquities, 17.1,3]. How differently did these two foster brothers turn out&#8212;the one, abandoned to a licentious life and stained with the blood of the most distinguished of God's prophets, though not without his fits of reformation and seasons of remorse; the other, a devoted disciple of the Lord Jesus and prophet of the Church at Antioch! But this is only what may be seen in every age: "Even so, Father, for so it seemeth good in Thy sight.' If the courtier, whose son, at the point of death, was healed by our Lord (Joh 4:46) was of Herod's establishment, while Susanna's husband was his steward (Lu 8:3), his foster brother's becoming a Christian and a prophet is something remarkable.<p>and Saul&#8212;last of all, but soon to become first. Henceforward this book is almost exclusively occupied with him; and his impress on the New Testament, on Christendom, and on the world is paramount.<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul....">Acts 13:1-5</a></span> Barnabas and Saul, being set apart with fasting and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>prayer, are sent forth by the Holy Ghost to the work<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>of their calling.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:...">Acts 13:6-12</a></span> At Paphos, Elymas the sorcerer, opposing the Gospel,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>is smitten with blindness, and the deputy Sergius<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paulus converted to the faith.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-13.htm" title="Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem....">Acts 13:13-41</a></span> Paul and his company come to Antioch in Pisidia: Paul<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>preacheth Christ, and the necessity of faith in him<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>unto justification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-42.htm" title="And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles sought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.">Acts 13:42</a>,43</span> The Gentiles desire to hear the word again: many are<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>converted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-44.htm" title="And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God....">Acts 13:44-49</a></span> The envious Jews gainsay and blaspheme: the apostles<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>profess to turn to the Gentiles, of whom many believe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-50.htm" title="But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts....">Acts 13:50-52</a></span> The Jews raise a persecution, and expel Paul and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Barnabas, who go to Iconium.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">The church that was at Antioch; </span> the true church, which hath a being, and whose Builder and Maker is God.

This was Antioch in Syria, where was a Gospel church, and where the disciples were first called Christians; from whence Saul and Barnabas had been sent to Jerusalem, with a supply for the poor saints there, in a time of famine, and from whence they were now returned: and here were <p>certain prophets and teachers; who were both prophets and teachers, though these are sometimes distinguished; who had both a gift of foretelling things to come, as Agabus and others, and of explaining the prophecies of the Old Testament, and of teaching the people evangelic truths; these, at least some of them, came from Jerusalem hither, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27</a>. <p>As Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger; the former of these was a Levite, and of the country of Cyprus, who sold his land and brought the money to the apostles; and who was first sent hither by the church at Jerusalem, upon hearing that many in this place believed, and turned to the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a> but of the latter no mention is made elsewhere; by his first name he appears to be a Jew, who by the Romans was called Niger; very likely from the blackness of his complexion, for that word signifies "black": and so the Ethiopic version interprets it: <p>and Lucius of Cyrene; who very probably was one of the synagogue of the Cyrenians, and seems manifestly to be one of the men of Cyrene, that went abroad upon the persecution raised at the death of Stephen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-9.htm">Acts 6:9</a> he is said to be bishop of Cyrene; some take him to be the same Lucius mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a> and others think he is the same with Luke the Evangelist: <p>and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch: or his foster brother. The Syriac version calls him Manail, and one of Stephens's copies Manael, and the Ethiopic version Manache, and renders what is said of him, "the son of king Herod's nurse"; which accounts for their being brought up, nourished, and suckled together: the name seems to be the same with Menachem, or Menahem, a name frequent with the Jews; there was one of this name, who was very intimate with Herod the great, and was in his service, though before he was vice president of the sanhedrim: the account that is given of him is this (z): <p>"Hillell and Shammai received from them (i.e. from Shemaia and Abtalion, who were presidents before them), but at first there were Hillell and Menahem, but Menahem went out, , "into the service of the king", with fourscore men clad in gold---Menahem was a very wise man, and a sort of a prophet, who delivered out many prophecies; and he told Herod when he was little, that he should reign; and after he was king, he sent for him, and he told him again, that he should reign more than thirty years, and he reigned thirty seven years, and he gave him great riches.'' <p>Of this Menahem, and of his going into the king's service, mention is made elsewhere (a): now though this Menahem cannot be the same with Manaen here, yet this Manaen, as Dr. Lightfoot conjectures, might be the son of him, and called after his name; who might be brought up with the son of Herod the great, here called the tetrarch; and who was Herod Antipas, the same that beheaded John the Baptist: and Saul; who afterwards was called Paul. <p>(z) Juchasin, fol. 19. 1.((a) Misn.

The same is also the case with Menahem (<span class="greekheb">מְנַחֵם</span>), who had been <span class="greekheb">σύντροφος</span> of the tetrarch Herod, i.e. of Antipas; see Walch, de Menachemo <span class="greekheb">συντρόφῳ</span> Herodis, Jen. 1758. But whether <span class="greekheb">σύντροφος</span> is, with the Vulgate, Cornelius a Lapide, Walch, Heumann, Kuinoel, Olshausen, and others, to be understood as foster-brother (conlactaneus, comp. Xen. Eph. ii. 3), so that Menahem’s mother was Herod’s nurse; or, with Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, Raphel, Wolf, Heinrichs, Baumgarten, Ewald, and others, brought up with, contubernalis,—cannot be determined, as either may be expressed by the word (see Wetstein and Kuinoel). The latter meaning, however (comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-6.htm" title="Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.">1Ma 1:6</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-29.htm" title="And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.">2Ma 9:29</a>; and see, in general, Jacobs, ad Anthol. XI. p. 38), makes the later Christian position of Menahem the more remarkable, in that he appears to have been brought up at the court of Herod the Great. At all events he was already an old man, and had become a Christian earlier than Saul, who is placed after him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν οὖσας ἐκκ</span>.: the word <span class="greekheb">οὖσαν</span> may well be used here, as the participle of <span class="greekheb">εἰμί</span> is often used in Acts to introduce some technical phrase, or some term marked out as having a technical force, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-13.htm" title="Then the priest of Jupiter, which was before their city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.">Acts 14:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.">Acts 28:17</a>, so that a new stage in the history of the Christians at Antioch is marked—no longer a mere congregation, but “the Church that was there” (Ramsay, <span class="ital">Church in the R.

So also Weiss, <span class="ital">in loco</span>; <span class="greekheb">οὖσαν</span> stands in contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-21.htm" title="And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord....">Acts 11:21-26</a> : there was no longer a mere company of believers at Antioch, but a Church.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Ἀ</span>.: Blass maintains that the order of words as compared with the mention of the Church in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-22.htm" title="Then tidings of these things came to the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.">Acts 11:22</a>, emphasises the fact that Antioch is the starting-point of the succeeding missionary enterprise, and is named first, and so distinctively set before men’s eyes.—<span class="greekheb">προφῆται καὶ διδάσκαλοι</span>, see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>.

The two gifts might be united in the same person as in Paul himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory.

But whilst it is quite possible to regard the account of the gift of <span class="greekheb">προφητεία</span> in 1 Corinthians 12-14 as expressing “inspiration” rather than “official character,” this does not detract from the pre-eminent honour and importance assigned to the prophets and teachers at Antioch. Their position is such and their powers are such in the description before us that they might fairly be described as “presbyters,” whose official position was enhanced by the possession of a special gift, “the prophecy” of the New Testament, “presbyters” who like those in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm" title="Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine.">1 Timothy 5:17</a> might also be described as <span class="greekheb">κοπιῶντες ἐν διδασκαλίᾳ</span>, Moberly, <span class="ital">Ministerial Priesthood</span>, pp. 159, 160, 166, 208. See further on the relation of the prophets and teachers in the <span class="ital">Didaché</span> “Church,” Hastings’ B.D., i. 436, Bigg, <span class="ital">Doctrine of the Twelve Apostles</span>, p. 27; and on the relation of prophecy and teaching in the N.T., McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 528, Zöckler, <span class="ital">in loco</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τε</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>: a difficulty arises as to the force of these particles. It is urged that two groups are thus represented, the first three names forming one group (prophets), and the last two another group (teachers), so Ramsay (p. 65), Weiss, Holtzmann, Zöckler, Harnack, Knabenbauer, and amongst older commentators Meyer and Alford; but on the other hand Wendt, so Nösgen, Felten, Hilgenfeld think that there is no such separation intended, as Paul himself later claims the prophetic gift (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-6.htm" title="Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?">1 Corinthians 14:6</a>), to which Zöckler would reply that at this time Paul might well be described as a teacher, his prophetic gift being more developed at a later date. Amongst recent English writers both Hort and Gore regard the term “prophets and teachers” as applying to all the five (so Page).—<span class="greekheb">Συμεὼν</span>: nothing is known of him. Spitta would identify him with Simon of Cyrene, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-32.htm" title="And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name: him they compelled to bear his cross.">Matthew 27:32</a>, but the epithet Niger may have been given to distinguish him from others of the same name, and possibly from the Simon to whom Spitta refers.—<span class="greekheb">Λούκιος ὁ Κ</span>.: Zöckler describes as “quite absurd” the attempt to identify him with Luke of the Acts. The names are quite different, and the identification has been supported on the ground that Cyrene was a famous school of medicine. This Lucius may have been one of the men of Cyrene, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>, who first preached the Gospel at Antioch. Others have proposed to identify him with the Lucius of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm" title="Timotheus my workfellow, and Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater, my kinsmen, salute you.">Romans 16:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">Μαναήν</span>: of the three names, as distinct from Barnabas and Paul, Blass says <span class="ital">ignoti reliqui</span>, and we cannot say more than this. For although Mark is described as <span class="greekheb">σύντροφος</span> of Herod the Tetrarch (Antipas), the description is still very indefinite. A.V. “brought up with,” R.V. “foster-brother,” <span class="ital">collactaneus</span>, Vulgate. For an ingenious study on the name and the man see Plumptre, <span class="ital">in loco, cf.</span> also Wetstein and Zöckler. The name occurs in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-6.htm" title="Wherefore he called his servants, such as were honourable, and had been brought up with him from his youth, and parted his kingdom among them, while he was yet alive.">1Ma 1:6</a>, but the reading must apparently give place to <span class="greekheb">συνέκτροφοι</span>. It is also found in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/9-29.htm" title="And Philip, that was brought up with him, carried away his body, who also fearing the son of Antiochus went into Egypt to Ptolemeus Philometor.">2Ma 9:29</a>, and once in the N.T. in the present passage. Deissmann, from the evidence of the inscriptions, regards it as a court title, and quotes amongst other places an inscription in Delos of the first half of the second century B.C., where Heliodorus is described as <span class="greekheb">σύντροφος τοῦ βασιλέως Σελεύκου φιλοπάτορος</span>. So Manaen also might be described as a confidential friend of Herod Antipas, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, pp. 173, 178–181.—<span class="greekheb">Σαῦλος</span>, placed last probably because the others were older members of the Church.

See also note on Acts 4:26).

The <span class="accented">teachers</span> would appear to differ from the prophets in that they were not under the ecstatic influence of the Holy Spirit, and did not utter exhortations or prophecies in a poetic strain, but were expounders of Christian truth, under the teaching of the Spirit. What they spoke was called a <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm">1 Corinthians 14:26</a>), and their function was <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is reckoned among the <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>, the gifts of the Holy Ghost.

It is thought by Meyer, Alford, and others that the position of the particles <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> attaching the two following names to Barnabas in the first place, and one name following to Manaen in the second, indicates that Barnabas, Symeon, and Lucius were prophets, and Manaen and Saul teachers. Lucius has by some been falsely identified with St. Luke. The foster-brother; <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1f7b;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> may equally mean a foster-brother, one nursed at the same time at the same breast, which would indicate that Manaen's mother was wet-nurse to Herod the tetrarch; or a playmate, which would indicate that he had been <span class="accented">sodalis</span> to Herod. It is only found here in the New Testament, but is used by Xenophon, Plutarch, etc., and in 1 Macc. 1:7; 2 Macc. 9:29. In this chapter and onwards the scene of the great drama of Christianity is transferred from Jerusalem to Antioch. The first part, which has hitherto been played by Peter and John and James, is now taken up by Barnabas and Saul, soon, however, to be classed as Paul and Barnabas. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Prophets<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-26.htm">Luke 7:26</a>.<p>Lucius of Cyrene<p>Attempts have been made to identify him with Luke the evangelist; but the name Lucas is an abbreviation of Lucanus, and not of Lucius. It is worth noting, however, that, according to Herodotus (iii., 131), the physicians of Cyrene had the reputation of being the second best in Greece, those of Crotona being the best; and that Galen the physician says that Lucius was before him a distinguished physician in Tarsus of Cilicia. From this it has been conjectured that Luke was born and instructed in medicine in Cyrene, and left that place for Tarsus, where he made Paul's acquaintance, and was, perhaps, converted by him (Dr. Howard Crosby, "The New Testament, Old and New Version"). But, apart from the form of the name (see above), the mention of the evangelist's name here is not in accord with his usual practice, since he nowhere mentions his own name, either in the Gospel or in the Acts; and if the present passage were an exception, we should have expected to find his name last in the list of the worthies of Antioch. Of the five here named, four are known to be Jews; and therefore, probably, Lucius was also a Jew from Cyrene, where Jews are known to have abounded. Luke the evangelist, on the contrary, was a Gentile. Nothing certain can be inferred from <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, where Lucius is enumerated by Paul among his kinsmen. If &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;, kinsmen, means here, as is claimed by some, countrymen, it would prove Lucius to be a Jew; but the word is commonly used of relatives in the New Testament. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>, Paul applies the term to his fellow-countrymen, "my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh, who are Israelites."<p>Which had been brought up with (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Some render foster-brother, as Rev.; others, comrade. The word has both meanings. </body></html>
