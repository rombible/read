The meaning, therefore, here is, I have this day declared thee to be my Son, as (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm" title="And declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead:">Romans 1:4</a>) Paul says, he was <span class="ital">declared to be the Son of God with power, by the resurrection from the dead. </span>And it is with peculiar propriety and beauty that God is said to have <span class="ital">begotten him </span>when he raised him from the dead, as Jesus seemed then to be born out of the earth anew. <span class="ital">And </span>to show <span class="ital">that he raised him up, no more to return to corruption </span>— That is, to die no more; <span class="ital">he said, I will give you the sure mercies of David </span>— The blessings promised to David in Christ, which are sure, certain, and firm to every true believer in him. Or, “mercies by the resurrection of him whom I have now set upon the throne of David, are made sure to you, and shall prove eternal as his life and reign.” The resurrection of Christ, therefore, is implied in the words: for without it those blessings could not have been given. <span class="ital">Wherefore he saith also, </span>(namely, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a>,) <span class="ital">Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption </span>— Words which, it is evident, must refer, not to the inspired writer himself, but to some other person; <span class="ital">for David </span>— By whom this Psalm was written; <span class="ital">after he had served his own generation, by the will of God </span>— Or, as the words may be rendered, <span class="ital">had served the will of God in his generation; fell asleep </span>— That is, died; <span class="ital">and saw corruption </span>— In the same manner as other human bodies do, when the soul is separated from them. Observe, reader, the character here given of David; <span class="ital">he served the will of God, </span>or, <span class="ital">served his generation according to the will of God. </span>This was his business here on earth: he lived for this purpose. What is thy business? Why art thou here? Thou who art yet in the world? Is it not that thou also mayest serve the will of God? Art thou serving it now? Doing all his will? O remember, only he that doth the will of God <span class="ital">shall enter the kingdom of heaven, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm" title="Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 7:21</a>. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:32-37 The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son of God. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And we - We who are here present.
