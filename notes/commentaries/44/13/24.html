The bare reading of the Scriptures in public assemblies is not enough; they should be expounded, and the people exhorted out of them. This is helping people in doing that which is necessary to make the word profitable, to apply it to themselves. Every thing is touched upon in this sermon, which might best prevail with Jews to receive and embrace Christ as the promised Messiah. And every view, however short or faint, of the Lord's dealings with his church, reminds us of his mercy and long-suffering, and of man's ingratitude and perverseness. Paul passes from David to the Son of David, and shows that this Jesus is his promised Seed; a Saviour to do that for them, which the judges of old could not do, to save them from their sins, their worst enemies. When the apostles preached Christ as the Saviour, they were so far from concealing his death, that they always preached Christ crucified. Our complete separation from sin, is represented by our being buried with Christ. But he rose again from the dead, and saw no corruption: this was the great truth to be preached.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When John had first preached ... - After John had preached and prepared the way, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3.htm">Matthew 3</a>:<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23-25. Of this man's seed hath God, according to &#8230; promise, raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus&#8212;The emphasis on this statement lies: (1) in the seed from which Christ sprang&#8212;David's&#8212;and the promise to that effect, which was thus fulfilled; (2) on the character in which this promised Christ was given of God&#8212;"a Saviour." His personal name "Jesus" is emphatically added, as designed to express that very character.

Or, "before the face of his entrance"; that is, on his public ministry; for John did not preach before the coming of Christ in the flesh, being born but half a year before him; but before he came forth and was manifest to Israel; before he entered upon his work and office, as a prophet and teacher of the people: and this points out the business of John the Baptist, who was the forerunner of Christ, and went before his face to prepare his way, who gave notice of his coming, and bore testimony to him; and whose testimony the apostle here produces, as being what the Jews could not well reject and deny, he being of so much probity and integrity, and so great a prophet, as he was accounted by all the people; and whom he prepared for the reception of the Messiah, by first preaching; <p>the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel: he not only administered the ordinance of baptism, but he preached the doctrine of it, opened the nature and design of it, and required repentance and fruits meet for it, in those who came to have it administered to them: for which reason it is called the baptism of repentance; and this he did publicly before all the people, when the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about Jordan, came unto him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-4.htm">Mark 1:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">When John had first preached <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.</span><p>(n) John as a herald did not show Christ coming from afar off, as the other prophets did, but right at hand and having already begun his journey.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-24.htm" title="When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.">Acts 13:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">προκηρύξ</span>. not in LXX or Apocrypha, but in classical Greek, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, x., 5, 1, and also in Plut., Polyb.—<span class="greekheb">πρὸ προσώπου τῆς εἰσόδου</span>: “before the face of his entering in,” R.V. margin, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-76.htm" title="And you, child, shall be called the prophet of the Highest: for you shall go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;">Luke 1:76</a>; here used temporally, really a Hebraistic pleonasm, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm" title="Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way before me: and the LORD, whom you seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom you delight in: behold, he shall come, said the LORD of hosts.">Malachi 3:1</a>, an expression used as still under the influence of that passage, Simcox, <span class="ital">Language of the N.
