To those, however, whose minds were full to overflowing with the writings of the prophets they would be pregnant with meaning. What were the “sure mercies of David” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm" title="Incline your ear, and come to me: hear, and your soul shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.">Isaiah 55:3</a>) but the “everlasting covenant” of mercy which was to find its fulfilment in One who should be “a leader and commander to the people?” We may well believe that the few words quoted recalled to St. Paul and to his hearers the whole of that wonderful chapter which opens with “Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters.” The Greek word for “mercies” is the same adjective as that translated “holy” in the next verse, “holiness” being identified with “mercy,” and so forms a connecting link with the prophecy cited in the next verse.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:32-37 The resurrection of Christ was the great proof of his being the Son of God. It was not possible he should be held by death, because he was the Son of God, and therefore had life in himself, which he could not lay down but with a design to take it again. The sure mercies of David are that everlasting life, of which the resurrection was a sure pledge; and the blessings of redemption in Christ are a certain earnest, even in this world. David was a great blessing to the age wherein he lived. We were not born for ourselves, but there are those living around us, to whom we must study to be serviceable. Yet here is the difference; Christ was to serve all generations. May we look to Him who is declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection from the dead, that by faith in him we may walk with God, and serve our generation according to his will; and when death comes, may we fall asleep in him, with a joyful hope of a blessed resurrection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as concerning - In further proof of this. To show that he actually did it, he proceeds to quote another passage of Scripture.<p>No more to return to corruption - The word "corruption" is usually employed to denote "putrefaction, or the mouldering away of a body in the grave; its returning to its native dust." But it is certain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-35.htm">Acts 13:35</a>. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm">Acts 2:27</a>) that the body of Christ never in this sense saw corruption. The word is therefore used to denote "death, or the grave, the cause and place of corruption." The word is thus used in the Septuagint. It means here simply that he should not die again.<p>He said on this wise - He said thus &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  houto&#772;s.<p>I will give you - This quotation is made from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>. It is quoted from the Septuagint, with a change of but one word, not affecting the sense. In Isaiah the passage does not refer particularly to the resurrection of the Messiah, nor is it the design of Paul to affirm that it does. His object in this verse is not to prove that he would rise from the dead, but that, being risen, he would not again die. That the passage in Isaiah refers to the Messiah there can be no doubt, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm">Acts 13:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-4.htm">Acts 13:4</a>. The passage here quoted is an address to the people, an assurance to them that the promise made to David would be performed, a solemn declaration that he would make an everlasting covenant with them through the Messiah, the promised descendant of David.<p>The sure mercies of David - The word "mercies" here refers to the promise made to David; the mercy or favor shown to him by promising to him a successor that should not fail to sit on his throne, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-4.htm">Psalm 89:4-5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/132-11.htm">Psalm 132:11-12</a>. These mercies and promises are called "sure," as being true or unfailing; they would certainly be accomplished. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-20.htm">2 Corinthians 1:20</a>. The word "David" here does not refer, as many have supposed, to the Messiah, but to the King of Israel. God made to David a promise, a certain pledge; he bestowed on him this special mercy, in promising that he should have a successor who should sit forever on his throne. This promise was understood by the Jews, and is often referred to in the New Testament, as relating to the Messiah. Paul here says that that promise is fulfilled. The only question is how it refers to the subject on which he was discoursing. The point was not mainly to prove his resurrection, but to show particularly that he would never die again, or that he would forever live and reign. And the argument is, that as God had promised that David should have a successor who should sit forever on his throne, and as this prediction now terminated in the Messiah, the Lord Jesus, it followed that, as that promise was sure and certain, he would never die again. He must live if the promise was fulfilled. And though he had been put to death, yet under that general promise there was a certainty that he would live again. It was impossible, the meaning is, that the Messiah, the promised successor of David, the perpetual occupier of his throne, should remain under the power of death. Under this assurance the church now reposes its hopes. Zion's King now lives, ever able to vindicate and save his people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34-37. now no more to return to corruption&#8212;that is, to the grave where death reigns; and compare Ro 6:9, "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him."<p>I will give you the sure mercies of David&#8212;(Isa 55:3). The word rendered "mercies" is peculiar, denoting the sanctity of them, as comprehending the whole riches of the new covenant; while the other word, "sure," points to the certainty with which they would, through David's Seed, be at length all substantiated. See on [2006]Joh 1:14. But how do these words prove the resurrection of Christ? "They presuppose it; for since an eternal kingdom was promised to David, the Ruler of this kingdom could not remain under the power of death. But to strengthen the indefinite prediction by one more definite, the apostle adduces Ps 16:10, of which Peter had given the same explanation (see on [2007]Ac 2:27; Ac 2:30, 31), both apostles denying the possibility of its proper reference to David" [Olshausen].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The former verse was not intended so much by St. Paul for a proof of the resurrection, as it was to show how faithful God was in fulfilling that promise there spoken of; here the apostle’s design is, to evince Christ’s resurrection, and that it was agreeable to the prophesies which were concerning him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will give you the sure mercies of David; </span> these words are found, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-3.htm" title="And the Gentiles shall come to your light, and kings to the brightness of your rising.">Isaiah 60:3</a></span>, and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the sure mercies of David</span> there and here spaken of, are such mercies as were promised to David (David being to be taken positively). Now the mercies which were promised to David are all included or surmounted in this, that by this Son of David (our Lord and Saviour, frequently and truly so called) God would erect and establish an everlasting kingdom; which could not be done, unless Christ rose again, and obtained the victory over death and the grave. All the promises God hath made unto his church in any age concerning Christ, are sure and faithful, holy and just; the words have been variously rendered and changed; but no words can sufficiently express their stability and excellency. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead,.... This, as it is differently expressed from the raising him up, spoken of in the preceding verse, so seems to be a distinct article from it, and is supported by other passages of Scripture: the apostle having shown that God had fulfilled his promise to the fathers, concerning the raising up, or sending the Messiah into the world, who is no other than the eternal Son of God, proceeds to prove his resurrection from the dead, as man, which was in such sort, as <p>now no more to return to corruption; so as not to die any more, and be laid in the grave, and there corrupted; as was the case of those who were raised from the dead by the prophets, under the Old Testament, or by Christ himself, before his death and resurrection; for these were raised to a mortal life, and died again, and were buried, and saw corruption; but Christ was raised up from the dead, never to die more, but to live forever, having in his hands the keys of hell and death, and being the triumphant conqueror over death and the grave; in proof of which some passages are produced out of the Old Testament, as follow: "he said on this wise"; that is, God said so, or after this manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a> "I will give you the sure mercies of David"; that is, of the Messiah; by which are meant the blessings of the sure and well ordered covenant of grace, which the Messiah by his sufferings and death was to ratify and secure for all his people: now had he only died, and not been raised from the dead, these blessings had not been ratified and made sure unto them; therefore, when God promises his people, that he will give them the sure mercies of David, or the Messiah, he promises that the Messiah shall not only die to procure mercies and blessings for them, but that he shall rise again from the dead, to make them sure unto them; so that these words are pertinently produced in proof of Christ's resurrection. David is a name frequently given to the Messiah, as in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-9.htm">Jeremiah 30:9</a> David being an eminent type of Christ, and the Messiah being a son of his; and who must be meant here; and which is owned by several Jewish commentators (o) of the best note; and which appears from his being called a witness to the people, a leader and a commander of them, in the next verse: the blessings of the covenant are fitly called "mercies", because they spring from the grace and mercy of God, and wonderfully display it, and are in mercy to his people; and these are the mercies of David, or of Christ, because the covenant being made with him, these blessings were put into his hands for them, and come through his blood to them; and hence they are said to be "sure" ones; they are in safe hands; Christ, who is intrusted with them, faithfully distributes them: but then, as by his death he has made way for the communication of them, consistent with the justice of God; so he must rise again, and live for ever, to distribute them, or see that there is an application of them made to the persons for whom they are designed: besides, it is one of the sure mercies promised to David, to the Messiah himself, that though he died, and was laid in the grave, he should not continue there, but rise again, as the next testimony most clearly shows. <p>(o) Aben Ezra &amp; Kimchi in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/55.htm">Isaiah 55</a>.3.

Isaiah has from the parallel put before this phrase, “an everlasting covenant.” Hence necessarily follows the resurrection of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-20.htm" title="Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the blood of the everlasting covenant,">Hebrews 13:20</a>; for without it the promised benefits of the Messiah could not have been enjoyed by the people of God. <span class="greekheb">אמונה</span>, <span class="greekheb">πίστις</span>, faith, is a conjugate and correlative to these (<span class="greekheb">ὅσια</span>) <span class="greekheb">πιστά</span><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34.</span> <span class="accented">- Hath spoken</span> for <span class="accented">said</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">holy and sure blessings</span> for <span class="accented">sure mercies</span>, A.V. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>No more to return to corruption</span>. This is added to show that Christ's resurrection was a final victory over death; not like that of Lazarus, or the Shunammite's son, or Jairus's daughter, but, as St. Paul himself says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-9.htm">Romans 6:9</a>), "Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more, death hath no more dominion over him." Here he tells us that this eternal exemption of Christ from death was promised or signified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-3.htm">Isaiah 55:3</a>, which he quotes from the LXX., only abbreviating the <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x2e;&#x3c4;&#x2e;&#x3bb;</span>., into <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;</span>, I will give. What, then, is meant by the <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>? The Hebrew has <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5bb;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e0;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5da;&#x5d0;&#x5de;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, which can mean nothing else but "the sure mercies of David," the favor and mercy promised to David in God's everlasting covenant, well ordered in all things and sure. And in like manner, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-42.htm">2 Chronicles 6:42</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f76;&#x3b4;</span> means "the mercies of God to David." And if we turn to the account of this covenanted mercy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7.htm">2 Samuel 7</a>, we shall see that it comprises the setting of David's seed upon his throne for ever (see specially vers. 12-16). In ver. 15 it is said, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5d0;&#x5b4;&#x20;&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e8;&#x20;&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, "My mercy shall not depart from him." And in the next verse his house and his kingdom are described as being <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b6;&#x5d0;&#x5b0;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5df;&#x20;&#x5dc;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, sure," or "established for ever," which, when applied to the personal Christ, the Son of David, manifestly implies his eternal exemption from death and corruption (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-4.htm">Psalm 132:4</a>). The sense of the Hebrew, therefore, is clever and certain, and it is equally certain that the LXX. meant to represent this sense in the version here quoted by St. Paul. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, though properly meaning "holy, pious," and thence "mild" and "merciful" (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, Hesych.) as applied to man, came to be applied in the same senses to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm">Revelation 16:5</a>; and here and in the LXX.). Beyond doubt, therefore, the passage before us is rightly rendered in the A.V., "the sure mercies of David;" the plural, <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, represents the <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b2;&#x5e1;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> of the Hebrew. Clemens Alex. (quoted by Schleusner) uses it in the same way for "mercies or "benefits:" <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>: "<span class="accented">For</span> how many mercies are we indebted to Christ!" In a similar way, the Latin <span class="accented">pietas</span> is used for God's "justice" or "kindness" ('AEneid,' 2:536; 5:688). "Trini pulses pietatem" (on a sepulchral monument, A.D. 1427): "Beat at the door of God's mercy." Gronovius, in his note on 'AEian. V. H.,' 8:1, where he ascribes to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> the primitive sense of what is "just" and "due," from man either to God or to his fellowman, adds, "Tribuunt quidem LXX? interpetiam Deo <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>: sod etiam tum significat quoddam quasi <span class="accented">offcium</span> benignitatia in heroines pios, Deo decorum." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The sure mercies (&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;)<p>Lit., the holy things, the sure.
