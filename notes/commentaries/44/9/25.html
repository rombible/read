It seems to follow, from the tone in which the Apostle there speaks of this adventure, that it had been made matter of ridicule. It is connected in his thoughts with the “infirmities” (probably with his smallness of stature) of which he was content to boast. The escape was effected, like that of the spies from the house of Rahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm" title="Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her house was on the town wall, and she dwelled on the wall.">Joshua 2:15</a>) and of David from his own house (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-11.htm" title="Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.">1Samuel 19:11</a>), through an opening or “window” in the town wall. Such a window is still shown in the wall of Damascus as the traditional scene of the escape.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:23-31 When we enter into the way of God, we must look for trials; but the Lord knows how to deliver the godly, and will, with the temptation, also make a way to escape. Though Saul's conversion was and is a proof of the truth of Christianity, yet it could not, of itself, convert one soul at enmity with the truth; for nothing can produce true faith, but that power which new-creates the heart. Believers are apt to be too suspicious of those against whom they have prejudices. The world is full of deceit, and it is necessary to be cautious, but we must exercise charity, 1Co 13:5. The Lord will clear up the characters of true believers; and he will bring them to his people, and often gives them opportunities of bearing testimony to his truth, before those who once witnessed their hatred to it. Christ now appeared to Saul, and ordered him to go quickly out of Jerusalem, for he must be sent to the Gentiles: see ch. 22:21. Christ's witnesses cannot be slain till they have finished their testimony. The persecutions were stayed. The professors of the gospel walked uprightly, and enjoyed much comfort from the Holy Ghost, in the hope and peace of the gospel, and others were won over to them. They lived upon the comfort of the Holy Ghost, not only in the days of trouble and affliction, but in days of rest and prosperity. Those are most likely to walk cheerfully, who walk circumspectly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Took him by night ... - This was done through a window in the wall, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>.<p>In a basket - This word is used to denote commonly "the basket in which food was carried," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-37.htm">Matthew 15:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/8-8.htm">Mark 8:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-20.htm">Mark 8:20</a>. It was in this way that Rahab let down the spies <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, and so David escaped from Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-12.htm">1 Samuel 19:12</a>. Probably this occurred in an unguarded part of the wall, where some overhanging houses, as is usual in Eastern cities, opened into the outer country. This conduct of Saul was in accordance with the direction of the Lord Jesus <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>, "When they persecute you in one city, flee ye into another," etc. Saul was certain of death if he remained; and as he could secure his life by flight without abandoning any principle of religion, or denying his Lord, it was his duty to do so. Christianity requires us to sacrifice our lives only when we cannot avoid it without denying the Saviour, or abandoning the principles of our religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

The Alexandrian copy reads, "his disciples"; the disciples of Saul, such as he had been instrumental in making at Damascus: but it is not usual for the saints to be called in Scripture the disciples of any man; therefore the common reading is best, and designs the disciples and followers of Christ; who being concerned for the preservation of so valuable a life, took Saul in the night season, <p>and let him down by the wall in a basket. Damascus was a walled city; hence we read of the wall of Damascus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-27.htm">Jeremiah 49:27</a>. And the house where Saul was, and which very likely was one of the disciples, was built upon the wall, as the house of Rahab was upon the town wall of Jericho; and as she let down the spies from thence by a cord through the window, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a> so the disciples let down Saul in a basket with cords through the window of the house, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>. See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>, no doubt, the disciples were directed by the overruling providence of God, in order to preserve the life of the apostle, who had much work to do for Christ in several parts of the world, and therefore must not fall into the hands of his enemies and die, his time not being yet come; and this shows, that it is lawful to make use of all prudent means and proper methods to prevent the designs of wicked men, and escape out of their hands, and preserve life when in danger; by which means Saul escaped their hands. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Then the disciples took him by night, and let <i>him</i> down by the wall in a basket.</span><p>(5) We are not forbidden to avoid and eschew the dangers and conspiracies that the enemies of God lay for us, but only if we do not swerve from our vocation.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/9.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-25.htm" title="Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall in a basket.">Acts 9:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ μαθηταὶ</span>—if we add <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>, see critical notes, the words would apparently refer to Jews converted by Saul, so Chrysostom: “but his disciples” R.V.

The basket here mentioned (<span class="ital">spuris</span>) is the same that is spoken of (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-37.htm" title="And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the broken meat that was left seven baskets full.">Matthew 15:37</a>) at the feeding of the four thousand in the mountain district west of the Sea of Galilee.

The <span class="accented">by</span> of the A.V. seems preferable to the <span class="cmt_word">through</span> of the R.V., as <span class="accented">through</span> suggests the idea, which cannot be intended, of making a hole in the wall. The escape of the spies from Jericho, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-15.htm">Joshua 2:15</a>, was exactly in the same way, except that they had only a rope to descend by, whereas St. Paul had a rope-basket. In the description of his escape given by St. Paul to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>), he uses the same word for "let down" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;</span>), tells us he was let down "by the wall," R.V. <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, with the additional particular that he got out through the window, <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and that it was a <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, a basket made of ropes (which describes the kind of basket somewhat more accurately than the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> here used) in which he was let down (see note on ver. 20). The passage in 2 Corinthians gives us a further interesting account of how the Jews went about to accomplish their purpose of killing Paul. It seems that at this time, either in revolt against the Romans or by permission of Caligula (it is not known certainly which), a certain Aretas, or Hareth, King of Arabia Petrea, included Damascus in his dominions for a time, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> through the reigns of Caligula and Claudius. He appointed an ethnarch, who was doubtless a Jew, to rule the large Jewish population according to their Law, and who was the ready tool of the unbelieving Jews, using his power as governor to have the gates kept day and night so as to prevent Saul's escape. But he that keepeth Israel neither slumbered nor slept, and by his watchful providence Saul escaped from their hands. As regards the R.Y., his disciples for <span class="accented">the disciples</span>, Alford adopts the reading <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, and holds <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> of the R.T. to be simply a mistake for <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, caused by the situation of <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span> after <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>. The R.T. cannot be right. "The disciples" is St. Luke's regular expression for "Christians" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1, 2, 7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10, 19, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm">Acts 21:16</a>), and is our Lord's name for his followers, but is never used by an apostle of his own followers (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm">1 Corinthians 1:12, 13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-4.htm">1 Corinthians 3:4-7</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/9.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>By the wall (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;)<p>Rev., more accurately, through the wall, as is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-33.htm">2 Corinthians 11:33</a>. Either through the window of a house overhanging the wall, or through a window in the wall itself opening to houses on its inner side.
