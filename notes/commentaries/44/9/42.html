Accordingly it is here said, <span class="ital">many believed in the Lord </span>— Namely, upon the credit of this signal miracle; many, not only at Joppa, but in other places. So that the great end for which the miracle was wrought was answered; this, and all other miracles that were done, being chiefly performed to cause the gospel to be believed, of the truth and importance of which they were undeniable proofs. <span class="ital">And he tarried many days </span>— Willing to improve so favourable an occasion as was now afforded him, of spreading the knowledge of Christ and his gospel. The miracle had only prepared the people to receive his doctrine, which he stayed some time to instruct them in; sowing the seed of the word in the ground prepared to receive it. And he tarried not in the house of Tabitha, (where, doubtless, he would have been hospitably entertained and comfortably accommodated,) lest he should seem to seek his own glory; but he took up his lodgings with an ordinary tradesman, whose business is here mentioned, perhaps, that it might appear the apostle was not elevated, by the dignity of the late miracle, above mean persons and things; and to teach us, in imitation of his example, to condescend to men of low estate. And though Peter might seem to be buried in obscurity in the house of a poor <span class="ital">tanner by the sea- side, </span>yet God fetched him thence to a noble piece of service, as we find in the next chapter; for <span class="ital">they that humble themselves shall be exalted.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:36-43 Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And many believed ... - A similar effect followed when Jesus raised up Lazarus.
