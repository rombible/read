Traces of its permanent effect on his powers of sight have been found in his habit of dictating rather than writing letters (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-17.htm" title="The salutation of Paul with my own hand, which is the token in every letter: so I write.">2Thessalonians 3:17</a>), in the large characters traced by him when he did write (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-11.htm" title="You see how large a letter I have written to you with my own hand.">Galatians 6:11</a>), in his not recognising the high priest who commanded him to be struck. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2-5</a>.) Of the many theories as to the mysterious “thorn in the flesh” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>), there seems most reason for accepting that which connects it with some affection of the eyes, involving, perhaps, attacks of agonising pain. On this assumption, the eager wish of the Galatians, if it had been possible to have plucked out their own eyes and given them to him, receives a special and interesting significance. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-15.htm" title="Where is then the blessedness you spoke of? for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me.">Galatians 4:15</a>.) For Saul himself, the blindness may well have had a spiritual significance. He had looked on himself as a “guide of the blind,” boasting that he saw clearly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-19.htm" title="And are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of them which are in darkness,">Romans 2:19</a>). Now, for a time, till inward and outward light should shine in on him, he had to accept his blindness. The new-born soul had to be as<p>“An infant crying for the light,<p>And with no language but a cry.”<p><span class= "bld">They led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus.</span>—The mission on which Saul had come was already known at Damascus, and his arrival expected with alarm. Now he came, and the mission fell to the ground. The letters to the synagogues were not delivered.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-8.htm" title="And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought him into Damascus....">Acts 9:8-9</a>. </span><span class="ital">And Saul arose from the earth — </span>When Christ bade him; but probably not without help, the vision having made him faint and weak, like Daniel; when, upon receiving a vision, <span class="ital">no strength remained in him, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/10-16.htm" title="And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength....">Daniel 10:16-17</a>. <span class="ital">And when his eyes were open, he saw no man </span>— He was incapable of discerning objects; for his nerves had been so affected with the glory of that light which had shone from the body of Jesus, that he had lost the power of sight, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm" title="And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.">Acts 22:11</a>; <span class="ital">but they </span>— That were with him; <span class="ital">led him by the hand </span>— For as they had not looked so earnestly and steadfastly, as Saul had done, on the glorious light wherewith the person of Christ was surrounded, but had lain with their faces on the ground, their eye-sight remained. <span class="ital">And he was three days without sight </span>— By scales growing over his eyes, not only to intimate to him the blindness of the state he had been in, but to impress him also with a deeper sense of the almighty power of Christ, and to turn his thoughts inward, while he was rendered less capable of conversing with external objects. This was, likewise, a manifest token to others, of what had happened to him in his journey; and ought to have humbled and convinced those bigoted Jews, to whom he had been sent from the sanhedrim. <span class="ital">And neither did eat nor drink </span>— This his long-continued fasting was a natural expression of his bitter grief, for having opposed the gospel, and persecuted the disciples of Jesus. With fasting he joined fervent and often-repeated prayer, perhaps, to Jesus; in which he made confession of his sin in persecuting him, and earnest supplication for pardon; all which, being certain signs of his repentance, they are here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>) mentioned as such. During his three days’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>blindness and fasting, Saul was instructed by visions and revelations from the Lord, agreeably to what was promised him, <span class="ital">that in Damascus it should be told him what he was to do. </span>One vision of this kind is expressly mentioned, in which the restoration of his sight by Ananias was foretold to him. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-12.htm" title="And has seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting his hand on him, that he might receive his sight.">Acts 9:12</a>. Here it is natural to reflect, that the situation in which Saul now lay, was indeed apparently very melancholy; his sight being lost, his appetite for food gone, and his whole soul wrapt up in deep astonishment, or melted in deep contrition and remorse. But, though he thus <span class="ital">sowed in tears, </span>he was soon to <span class="ital">reap in joy. </span>Light and gladness were sown for him. He came out of the furnace refined as gold and silver; and these three dark and dismal days are, no doubt, recollected by him in the heavenly world, as the era from whence he dates the first beamings of that divine light in which he now dwells. Let us never be afraid of the pangs of that <span class="ital">godly sorrow, </span>which, <span class="ital">working repentance to salvation, not to be repented of, </span>will soon be ten thousand times overbalanced by that <span class="ital">exceeding weight of glory, </span>and those full transports of eternal joy, for which it will prepare the soul. See Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:1-9 So ill informed was Saul, that he thought he ought to do all he could against the name of Christ, and that he did God service thereby; he seemed to breathe in this as in his element. Let us not despair of renewing grace for the conversion of the greatest sinners, nor let such despair of the pardoning mercy of God for the greatest sin. It is a signal token of Divine favour, if God, by the inward working of his grace, or the outward events of his providence, stops us from prosecuting or executing sinful purposes. Saul saw that Just One, ch. 22:14; 26:13. How near to us is the unseen world! It is but for God to draw aside the veil, and objects are presented to the view, compared with which, whatever is most admired on earth is mean and contemptible. Saul submitted without reserve, desirous to know what the Lord Jesus would have him to do. Christ's discoveries of himself to poor souls are humbling; they lay them very low, in mean thoughts of themselves. For three days Saul took no food, and it pleased God to leave him for that time without relief. His sins were now set in order before him; he was in the dark concerning his own spiritual state, and wounded in spirit for sin. When a sinner is brought to a proper sense of his own state and conduct, he will cast himself wholly on the mercy of the Saviour, asking what he would have him to do. God will direct the humbled sinner, and though he does not often bring transgressors to joy and peace in believing, without sorrows and distress of conscience, under which the soul is deeply engaged as to eternal things, yet happy are those who sow in tears, for they shall reap in joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When his eyes were opened - He naturally closed them at the appearance of the light, and in his fright kept them closed for some time.<p>He saw no man - This darkness continued three days, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-9.htm">Acts 9:9</a>. There is no reason to suppose that there was a miracle in this blindness, for in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-11.htm">Acts 22:11</a>, it is expressly said to have been caused by the intense light. "And when I could not see for the glory of that light," etc. The intense, sudden light had so affected the optic nerve of the eye as to cause a temporary blindness. This effect is not uncommon. The disease of the eye which is thus produced is called "amaurosis," or more commonly "gutta serena." It consists in a loss of sight without any apparent defect of the eye. Sometimes the disease is periodic, coming on suddenly, continuing for three or four days, and then disappearing (Webster). A disease of this kind is often caused by excessive light. When we look at the sun, into a furnace, or into a crucible with fused metal, we are conscious of a temporary pain in the eye, and of a momentary blindness. "In northern and tropical climates, from the glare of the sun or snow, a variety of amaurosis (gutta serena) occurs, which, if it produces blindness during the day, is named nyctalopia; if during the night, it is called hemeralopia. Another variety exists in which the individual is blind all day, until a certain hour, when he sees distinctly, or he sees and is blind every alternate day, or is only blind one day in the week, fortnight, or month" (the Edinburgh Encyclopedia's "Surgery"). A total loss of sight has been the consequence of looking at the sun during an eclipse, or of watching it as it sets in the west. This effect is caused by the intense action of the light on the optic nerve, or sometimes from a disorder of the brain. A case is mentioned by Michaelis (Kuinoel in loco) of a man who was made blind by a bright flash of lightning, and who continued so for four weeks, who was again restored to sight in a tempest by a similar flash of lightning. Electricity has been found to be one of the best remedies for restoring sight in such cases. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

By <span class="ital">fasting</span> Saul partly satisfied the compunction into which he could not but now feel himself brought for the earlier wrong direction of his efforts, and partly prepared himself by fasting and prayer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>) for the decisive change of his inward and outward life, for which, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-6.htm" title="And he trembling and astonished said, Lord, what will you have me to do?

That blinding of Saul was a simple consequence of the heavenly radiance, and served (as also the fasting) to withdraw him for a season wholly from the outer world, and to restrict him to his inner life.
