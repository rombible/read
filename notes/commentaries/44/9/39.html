The “widows” of the Church were the object of a special provision. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>.) The “coats,” were the close-fitting tunics worn next the body, the “garments” the looser outer cloaks that were worn over them. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-40.htm" title="And if any man will sue you at the law, and take away your coat, let him have your cloak also.">Matthew 5:40</a>.) These were now exhibited by those who were mourning over the loss of their benefactress. It is probable that the garments were for the use of men and boys, as well as women, and that the “widows” had been fellow-workers with her in making them. She was, as it were, at the head of a Sisterhood of Mercy.<p><span class= "bld">Which Dorcas made.</span>—More accurately, <span class= "ital">used to make.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them....">Acts 9:39-41</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Peter arose and went with them </span>— Doubtless God inclined him so to do, intending to work an extraordinary miracle by him, for the manifestation of his truth and glory. <span class="ital">And when he was come </span>— To Tabitha’s house; <span class="ital">they brought him into the upper chamber </span>— Where she was laid out. <span class="ital">And all the widows </span>— Who had been relieved by her benevolence; <span class="ital">stood by him weeping, showing the coats, </span>&c. — Here was no need of mourning women to be hired: the death of this woman was a common loss; these coats were made by her in her life-time, to clothe the poor and naked therewith. <span class="ital">But Peter put them all forth </span>— That he might with the more freedom pour out his soul before God in prayer on this occasion, and not be disturbed with their mournful lamentations. <span class="ital">And </span>he <span class="ital">kneeled down and prayed </span>— In his healing Eneas there was an implicit prayer; but in this greater work he addressed himself to God in solemn prayer, as Christ did when he raised Lazarus; but Christ’s prayer was with the authority of a Son, who quickens whom he will; Peter’s with the submission of a servant, who is under direction, and therefore he <span class="ital">kneeled down </span>when he offered it. And then rising, <span class="ital">and turning to the body, </span>he <span class="ital">said</span> — As with the voice of authority, in the name and presence of his great Lord, the Sovereign of life and death; <span class="ital">Tabitha, arise </span>— Words which were immediately accompanied with a divine power, so that she <span class="ital">opened her eyes, </span>and seeing <span class="ital">Peter, sat up </span>— Showing that she was really and truly alive. <span class="ital">And when he had called the saints and widows — </span>Who were all in sorrow for her death, and were near the chamber, waiting impatiently for the event; <span class="ital">he presented her alive </span>— And in perfect health, as all were that were miraculously cured. Who can imagine the surprise of Dorcas, when called back to life? or of her friends, when they saw her alive? For the sake of themselves, and the poor, there was cause of rejoicing; and much more for such a confirmation of the gospel. Yet to herself it was matter of resignation, not joy, to be called back to these scenes of vanity: but, doubtless, her remaining days were still more zealously spent in the service of her Saviour and her God. Thus was a richer treasure laid up for her in heaven, and she afterward returned to a more exceeding weight of glory, than that from which so astonishing a providence had recalled her for a season.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:36-43 Many are full of good words, who are empty and barren in good works; but Tabitha was a great doer, no great talker. Christians who have not property to give in charity, may yet be able to do acts of charity, working with their hands, or walking with their feet, for the good of others. Those are certainly best praised whose own works praise them, whether the words of others do so or not. But such are ungrateful indeed, who have kindness shown them, and will not acknowledge it, by showing the kindness that is done them. While we live upon the fulness of Christ for our whole salvation, we should desire to be full of good works, for the honour of his name, and for the benefit of his saints. Such characters as Dorcas are useful where they dwell, as showing the excellency of the word of truth by their lives. How mean then the cares of the numerous females who seek no distinction but outward decoration, and who waste their lives in the trifling pursuits of dress and vanity! Power went along with the word, and Dorcas came to life. Thus in the raising of dead souls to spiritual life, the first sign of life is the opening of the eyes of the mind. Here we see that the Lord can make up every loss; that he overrules every event for the good of those who trust in him, and for the glory of his name.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Peter arose - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-18.htm">Luke 15:18</a>.<p>And all the widows - Whom Dorcas had benefited by her kindness.

After the messengers had delivered their message, and made their request to Peter in the name of the brethren, he at once agreed to go with them, and accordingly did; whether he went to restore Dorcas to life, whose death the messengers had informed him of, and whether this was the view of the brethren with respect to that, is not certain. However, he might go with them on other accounts, as to comfort them under the loss of so valuable and useful a person, and to strengthen and establish them in the faith, and to exhort and animate them to the discharge of their duty. <p>When he was come; that is, to Joppa, and to Dorcas's house there: <p>they brought him into the upper chamber; where the corpse of Dorcas lay: <p>and all the widows stood by him weeping; these were poor widows, to whom Dorcas had been very liberal and beneficent, who stood about the apostle lamenting the death of their benefactress, and by their tears expressing their desire of her return to life, if it could be: <p>and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made while she was with them; the Vulgate, Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "which Dorcas made for them"; and the Syriac version renders it, "which Tabitha gave unto them, while she was alive"; which last clause aptly explains, "while she was with them"; for now she was not, with respect to her better part, her immortal soul: the coats and garments were the inner and upper ones, wore in these countries; and it seems that she did not buy these garments, and give them unto them, but that she made them up herself for them, or at least wrought with them in making of them; which shows her diligence and industry, as also her humility, as well as her beneficence: and these the widows produced, and are shown as proofs of the same; which was expressive of gratitude in them, and was done with a design to move Peter to be concerned for restoring so useful a life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then Peter arose and went with them.
