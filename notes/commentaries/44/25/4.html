By what invisible springs does God govern the world! With what silence, and yet with what wisdom and energy! Nevertheless, Festus was willing to do them the justice of hearing what they had to say against Paul, if they would go down with him to Cesarea, and appear against him there. <span class="ital">Let them, said he, which among you are able </span>— Who are best able to undertake the journey, and to manage the cause; <span class="ital">go down with me, and accuse this man </span>— In my hearing: or, let those go and give in their evidence that are competent witnesses, and are able to prove any thing criminal upon him; <span class="ital">if there be any wickedness in him </span>— For which he ought to be punished according to the Roman laws. So he does not pass sentence before he hears the cause, nor take it for granted that there was wickedness in him till it should be proved upon him, and he had been heard in his own defence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:1-12 See how restless malice is. Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But Festus answered ... - What induced Festus to refuse their request is not known. It is probable, however, that he was apprised that Paul was a Roman citizen, and that his case could not come before the Jewish Sanhedrin, but must be heard by himself. As Caesarea was also at that time the residence of the Roman governor, and the place of holding the courts, and as Paul was lodged there safely, there did not appear to be any sufficient reason for removing him to Jerusalem for trial. Festus, however, granted them all that they could reasonably ask, and assured them that he should have a speedy trial. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4-6. answered that Paul should be kept&#8212;rather, "is in custody."<p>at C&aelig;sarea, and &#8230; himself would depart shortly thither.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is most probable that Festus had been informed by Felix of the Jews’ malice against Paul; for Felix having been accused by the Jews unto the emperor, might be supposed to have recriminated wheresoever he had any opportunity; and in all the time of his government they were not guilty of a worse fact than their design against Paul, it being sedition, and intended murder of one who had the privilege of a Roman citizen. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He himself would depart shortly thither; </span> the governors kept their courts wheresoever they came. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea,.... Or that he was kept there, and was in proper custody, under the care of a centurion, and should continue there; nor was there any reason why he should be removed, especially since he should return thither speedily, as he adds: <p>and that he himself would depart shortly thither; the answer was a very wise and prudent one, and the reasons given were just and strong; as that Paul had been sent to Caesarea, was left bound by his predecessor there; there he found him, and there he was under a proper guard, and there it was right for him to continue; and besides, he himself should make no stay in Jerusalem, but should depart for Caesarea in a few days, and therefore it was very improper to send for Paul thither. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/25.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-4.htm" title="But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly thither.">Acts 25:4</a>.
