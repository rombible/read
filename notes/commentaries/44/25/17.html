How many unjust and hasty judgments the Roman maxim, ver. 16, condemn! This heathen, guided only by the light of nature, followed law and custom exactly, yet how many Christians will not follow the rules of truth, justice, and charity, in judging their brethren! The questions about God's worship, the way of salvation, and the truths of the gospel, may appear doubtful and without interest, to worldly men and mere politicians. See how slightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of the great controversy between the Jews and the Christians. But the day is at hand when Festus and the whole world will see, that all the concerns of the Roman empire were but trifles and of no consequence, compared with this question of Christ's resurrection. Those who have had means of instruction, and have despised them, will be awfully convinced of their sin and folly. Here was a noble assembly brought together to hear the truths of the gospel, though they only meant to gratify their curiosity by attending to the defence of a prisoner. Many, even now, attend at the places of hearing the word of God with great pomp, and too often with no better motive than curiosity. And though ministers do not now stand as prisoners to make a defence for their lives, yet numbers affect to sit in judgment upon them, desirous to make them offenders for a word, rather than to learn from them the truth and will of God, for the salvation of their souls But the pomp of this appearance was outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honour of their fine appearance, compared with that of Paul's wisdom, and grace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ! It is no small mercy to have God clear up our righteousness as the light, and our just dealing as the noon-day; to have nothing certain laid to our charge. And God makes even the enemies of his people to do them right.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore when they were come hither ... - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-6.htm">Acts 25:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-21. to deliver any man to die&#8212;On the word "deliver up," see on [2111]Ac 25:11.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Festus had gratified the Jews in what lawfully he might, not detaining them at charges from their habitations: and that not only commends Festus’s own justice, but Paul’s innocence; for if Paul had not appeared guiltless, he would have left him to the rage of the Jews, whom he desired to gratify what he could. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore when they were come hither,....

It is true that political charges were also brought forward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-8.htm" title="While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I offended any thing at all.">Acts 25:8</a>), but “hinc iterum conjicere licet, imo aperte cognoscere, adeo futiles fuisse calumnias, ut in judicii rationem venire non debuerint, perinde ac si quis convicium temere jactet,” Calvin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-19.htm" title="But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.">Acts 25:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῆς ἰδίας δεισιδαιμ</span>.] <span class="ital">concerning their own religion</span>.

Moreover, the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ περί τινος Ἰησοῦ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span> bear quite the impress of the indifference and insignificance which Festus attached to this very point, inasmuch as, in regard to the <span class="greekheb">τεθνηκότος</span>, he does not even condescend to designate the <span class="ital">mode</span> of death, and, as regards the <span class="greekheb">ζῆν</span>, sees in it an empty pretence (<span class="greekheb">ἔφασκεν</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-9.htm" title="And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.">Acts 24:9</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-20.htm" title="And because I doubted of such manner of questions, I asked him whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.">Acts 25:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπορούμενος</span>] <span class="ital">but I, uncertain on my part</span>.
