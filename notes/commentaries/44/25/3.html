Persecutors deem it a peculiar favour to have their malice gratified. Preaching Christ, the end of the law, was no offence against the law. In suffering times the prudence of the Lord's people is tried, as well as their patience; they need wisdom. It becomes those who are innocent, to insist upon their innocence. Paul was willing to abide by the rules of the law, and to let that take its course. If he deserved death, he would accept the punishment. But if none of the things whereof they accused him were true, no man could deliver him unto them, with justice. Paul is neither released nor condemned. It is an instance of the slow steps which Providence takes; by which we are often made ashamed, both of our hopes and of our fears, and are kept waiting on God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And desired favour against him - Desired the favor of Festus, that they might accomplish their wicked purpose on Paul.<p>Would send for him to Jerusalem - Probably under a pretence that he might be tried by the Sanhedrin; or perhaps they wished Festus to hear the cause there, and to decide it while he was at Jerusalem.

It is altogether probable that if this request had been granted, Paul would have been killed. But God had promised him that he should bear witness to the truth at Rome <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/23-11.htm">Acts 23:11</a>, and his providence was remarkable in thus influencing the mind of the Roman governor, and defeating the plans of the Jewish council. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. desired favour&#8212;in Ac 25:15, "judgment."<p>against him&#8212;It would seem that they had the insolence to ask him to have the prisoner executed even without a trial (Ac 25:16).<p>laying wait &#8230; to kill him&#8212;How deep must have been their hostility, when two years after the defeat of their former attempt, they thirst as keenly as ever for his blood!

Paul; they asked what would be a favour to them, and a prejudice to him: or "of him", that is, of Festus; they asked a favour of him, and desired it as such, as what would be gratefully accepted and acknowledged by them; which sense is confirmed by the Syriac version; the Arabic version renders it "to", or "upon them"; that is, they asked him to grant a favour to them, or bestow one on them, which is as follows: <p>that he would send for him to Jerusalem; that his case might be heard before him, and he might be tried and judged by him, as they pretended: <p>laying wait in the way to kill him; this was their design, though they concealed it, and pretended no other view than that justice might take place: their scheme was, that if they could have prevailed upon Festus to have sent for Paul to Jerusalem, from Caesarea, they would have provided men, perhaps the same forty and upwards as before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-12.htm">Acts 23:12</a> to have laid in wait for him in the way as he came, and to have killed him: the whole of this shows the malice of these men, the badness of their cause, the indefatigableness and diligence to attain their end, the danger the apostle was in, and the care of Providence over him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And desired favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/25.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-3.htm" title="And desired favor against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait in the way to kill him.">Acts 25:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">αἰτουμ</span>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-15.htm" title="About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, desiring to have judgment against him.">Acts 25:15</a>. “Postulantes gratiam non justitiam,” Corn à Lapide.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνέδραν ποιοῦντες</span>, not <span class="greekheb">ποιήσοντες</span>, they were making and contriving the ambush <span class="ital">already</span> (Alford): priests and elders were willing as before to avail themselves of the assassin.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὴν ὁδόν</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-4.htm" title="Carry neither purse, nor money, nor shoes: and salute no man by the way.">Luke 10:4</a>, and three times in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-36.htm" title="And as they went on their way, they came to a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, here is water; what does hinder me to be baptized?">Acts 8:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm" title="At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and them which journeyed with me.">Acts 26:13</a>, nowhere else in N.
