The fact was the first fulfilment of the promise that the Apostle was to bear His witness before “kings” as well as rulers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>). The Greek word for “pomp” (more literally, <span class= "ital">show</span>) is not found elsewhere in the New Testament. There is an almost tragic pathos in the thought, which must have been present to the mind of the historian, and perhaps, also, to that of others, that this display of the pride of state was exhibited in the very city that had witnessed the terrible chastisement of a like display in his father. The vice was inherited: the lesson had not been learnt.<p><span class= "bld">The chief captains.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">chiliarchs, </span>as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-31.htm" title="And as they went about to kill him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.">Acts 21:31</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/25-23.htm" title="And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus' commandment Paul was brought forth....">Acts 25:23-27</a>. </span><span class="ital">On the morrow, </span>&c. — Festus, accordingly, performed his promise to the king; <span class="ital">and when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp </span>— Of apparel, attendants, guards, &c.; Greek, <span class="greekheb">μετα πολλης φαντασιας</span>, <span class="ital">with great show, </span>or <span class="ital">splendour. </span>But all this pomp and show was far outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honour of their fine clothes, compared with his wisdom, grace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ? His bonds in so good a cause were more glorious than their chains of gold, and his guards than their equipage. Who would be fond of worldly pomp, that here sees so bad a woman loaded with it, and so good a man loaded with the reverse of it? <span class="ital">And was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, </span><span class="greekheb">χιλιαρχοις</span>, <span class="ital">the tribunes, and principal men of the city </span>— Men of the greatest note and eminence, that is, the chief officers, both military and civil; <span class="ital">at Festus’s commandment Paul was brought forth — </span>Before this splendid audience. Then <span class="ital">Festus said — </span>Festus, rising up, made an elegant speech to the assembly, in which he declared that at the former trial no crime had been proved against the prisoner; but that as he had appealed to Cesar, he had brought him forth, that, after a second examination, he might have something more certain to write to the emperor concerning the crimes laid to the prisoner’s charge. <span class="ital">For, </span>says he, <span class="ital">it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner </span>— Especially so far as Rome; <span class="ital">and not withal to signify the crimes laid against him </span>— That the matter may be prepared as much as possible, and put in readiness, for the emperor’s determination. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:13-27 Agrippa had the government of Galilee. How many unjust and hasty judgments the Roman maxim, ver. 16, condemn! This heathen, guided only by the light of nature, followed law and custom exactly, yet how many Christians will not follow the rules of truth, justice, and charity, in judging their brethren! The questions about God's worship, the way of salvation, and the truths of the gospel, may appear doubtful and without interest, to worldly men and mere politicians. See how slightly this Roman speaks of Christ, and of the great controversy between the Jews and the Christians. But the day is at hand when Festus and the whole world will see, that all the concerns of the Roman empire were but trifles and of no consequence, compared with this question of Christ's resurrection. Those who have had means of instruction, and have despised them, will be awfully convinced of their sin and folly. Here was a noble assembly brought together to hear the truths of the gospel, though they only meant to gratify their curiosity by attending to the defence of a prisoner. Many, even now, attend at the places of hearing the word of God with great pomp, and too often with no better motive than curiosity. And though ministers do not now stand as prisoners to make a defence for their lives, yet numbers affect to sit in judgment upon them, desirous to make them offenders for a word, rather than to learn from them the truth and will of God, for the salvation of their souls But the pomp of this appearance was outshone by the real glory of the poor prisoner at the bar. What was the honour of their fine appearance, compared with that of Paul's wisdom, and grace, and holiness; his courage and constancy in suffering for Christ! It is no small mercy to have God clear up our righteousness as the light, and our just dealing as the noon-day; to have nothing certain laid to our charge. And God makes even the enemies of his people to do them right.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With great pomp - Greek: "with much phantasy" &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  phantasias; with much show, parade, and splendor.
