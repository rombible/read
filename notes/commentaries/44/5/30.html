It meets us again in Peter’s speech to Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>.

We cannot expect to be redeemed and healed by Christ, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Faith takes the Saviour in all his offices, who came, not to save us in our sins, but to save us from our sins. Had Christ been exalted to give dominion to Israel, the chief priests would have welcomed him. But repentance and remission of sins are blessings they neither valued nor saw their need of; therefore they, by no means, admitted his doctrine. Wherever repentance is wrought, remission is granted without fail. None are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of sin; who are turned from it, and turned against it. Christ gives repentance, by his Spirit working with the word, to awaken the conscience, to work sorrow for sin, and an effectual change in the heart and life. The giving of the Holy Ghost, is plain evidence that it is the will of God that Christ should be obeyed. And He will surely destroy those who will not have Him to reign over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Raised up Jesus - This refers to his resurrection.<p>Hanged on a tree - That is, on the "cross," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm">1 Peter 2:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm">Acts 10:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm">Acts 13:29</a>. This is the amount of Peter's defense. He begins with the great principle <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-29.htm">Acts 5:29</a>, which they could not gainsay, that God ought to be obeyed rather than man. He then proceeds to state that they were convinced that God had raised up Jesus from the dead, and as they had such decisive evidence of that, and were commanded by the authority of the Lord Jesus to be "witnesses of that," they were not "at liberty" to be silent. They were bound to obey God rather than the Sanhedrin, and to make known everywhere the fact that the Lord Jesus was risen. The remark that God had raised up Jesus whom they had "slain," does not seem to have been made to irritate or to reproach them, but merely to "identify" him as the person that had been raised. It was also a confirmation of the truth and reality of the miracle. Of his "death" they had no doubt, for they had been at pains to certify it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-31.htm">John 19:31-34</a>. It is certain, however, that Peter did not shrink from charging on them their guilt; nor was he at any pains to "soften" or "mitigate" the severe charge that they had murdered their own Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29, 30.

Is it not possible that, as in the days of old God had raised up a Saviour, or Saviours, for Israel, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-18.htm" title="And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them.">Jdg 2:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἤγειρε Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς κριτάς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm" title="And when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.">Jdg 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-15.htm" title="But when the children of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left handed: and by him the children of Israel sent a present to Eglon the king of Moab.">Jdg 3:15</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἤγειρε Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σωτῆρα τῷ Ἰ</span>., St. Peter may now speak of Him as raising up <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦς</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, a Saviour? see further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>.—<span class="greekheb">διεχειρίσασθε</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-21.htm" title="For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.">Acts 26:21</a>, “whom ye slew, hanging Him on a tree,” R.V., not as in A.V., “whom ye slew and hanged on a tree,” which would make the words refer to a Jewish mode of punishment, for, according to Jewish law, only those were hanged who were already dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:">Deuteronomy 21:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm" title="And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.">Joshua 10:26</a>). The word which means in middle to lay hands upon, and so to slay, to kill, is only used by St. Luke (not in LXX), and forcibly represents the guilt of the Jews in the murder of Jesus, as if they had perpetrated it with their own hands (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-24.htm" title="And as he thus spoke for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are beside yourself; much learning does make you mad.">Acts 26:24</a>), “made away with violently,” Page; <span class="ital">cf.</span> instances in Wetstein (<span class="ital">trucidastis</span>).—<span class="greekheb">κρεμάσαντες ἐπὶ ξύλου</span>, LXX, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-19.htm" title="Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up your head from off you, and shall hang you on a tree; and the birds shall eat your flesh from off you.">Genesis 40:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-22.htm" title="And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be to be put to death, and you hang him on a tree:...">Deuteronomy 21:22-23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-26.htm" title="And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged them on five trees: and they were hanging on the trees until the evening.">Joshua 10:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/5-14.htm" title="Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak you to the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go you in merrily with the king to the banquet.

Although St. Luke uses <span class="greekheb">κρευασθείς</span> of crucifixion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm" title="And one of the malefactors which were hanged railed on him, saying, If you be Christ, save yourself and us.">Luke 23:39</a>, St. Peter alone uses the exact phrase of the text given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>, and so he too has <span class="greekheb">ξύλον</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>, for the Cross (although St. Paul uses the same word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-29.htm" title="And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree, and laid him in a sepulcher.">Acts 13:29</a>). The word may therefore have a place amongst the many coincidences between St. Peter’s addresses and the language of his Epistles, see above on pp. 121 ff. The fact that their victim was thus accursed in the eyes of the law aggravated their guilt, and at the same sharply contrasted their act and that of God; for a similar contrast see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/3-14.htm" title="But you denied the Holy One and the Just, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;...">Acts 3:14-15</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">30</span>. <span class="ital">The God of our fathers raised up Jesus</span>] As Peter did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>, so here the Apostles point out that there is no severance of themselves from the worship of the Covenant God of Israel, but that they were teaching that His promise through Moses had now been fulfilled, for that in Jesus the promised prophet had appeared.
