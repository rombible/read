(See <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke’s Gospel.</span>) So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm" title="As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.">Acts 8:3</a> women are named as prominent among the sufferers in the first general persecution.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-16 The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should make the sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry. Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers. Christ will work by all his faithful servants; and every one who applies to him shall be healed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And believers - This is the name by which Christians were designated, because one of the main things that distinguished them was that they "believed" that Jesus was the Christ. It is also an incidental proof that none should join themselves to the church who are not "believers"; that is, who do not profess to be Christians in heart and in life.<p>Were the more added - The effect of all these things was to increase the number of converts. Their persecutions, their preaching, and the judgment of God, "all" tended to impress the minds of the people, and to lead them to the Lord Jesus Christ. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>. Though the judgment of God had the effect of deterring hypocrites from entering the church - though it produced awe and caution, yet still the number of true converts was increased. An effort to keep the church pure by wholesome discipline, and by cutting off unworthy members, however rich or honored, so far from weakening its true strength, has a tendency greatly to increase its numbers as well as its purity. People will not seek to enter a corrupt church, or regard it as worth any effort to be connected with a society that does not endeavor to be pure.<p>Multitudes - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm">Acts 4:4</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-16. of the rest durst no man join himself, &c.&#8212;Of the unconverted none ventured, after what had taken place, to profess discipleship; but yet their number continually increased.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This explains the former verse, and helps us against mistaking it, for this wonderful judgment was so far from being a hinderance to the men of the gospel, that it is turned to the furtherance of it; for though great men, and such as were insincere, were terrified from owning Christ and his doctrine, others did more readily embrace them by reason of it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And believers were the more added to the Lord,.... That is, to the church, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a> over which Christ was Lord and head; for they were added to the Lord before, by believing in him, when they gave up themselves to him, to be saved by him; and now to the apostles, and the church by the will of God; and this case of Ananias and Sapphira was so far from hindering persons from coming into the church, that there were greater additions made to it than before, even of such as were true believers in Christ. The Ethiopic version reads, "and many were added who believed in our Lord"; the Arabic version, "they that believed in the Lord increased"; the Syriac version, "and they more increased who believed in the Lord"; and so the Vulgate Latin version, "but the multitude of them that believe in the Lord were the more increased"; all of them reading the phrase, "the Lord", not in construction with the word "added", but with "believers: multitudes both of men and women"; the weaker sex were not intimidated any more than the men, such power went along with the word, and such grace was bestowed upon them. This church must now be prodigiously numerous, for before these additions, eight thousand had been added to the hundred and twenty; such success the Gospel had, and such progress it made in the hands of such mean and contemptible persons, notwithstanding the opposition of the chief men of the nation to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-14.htm" title="And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)">Acts 5:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">μᾶλλον δέ προσετίθεντο</span>: the favour of the people which still protected the Church (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>) resulted in further increase of believers, “were the more added,” <span class="ital">um so mehr</span>; imperfect, signifying the continuous growth of the Church; on the verb see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">πλήθη</span>, plural (only here in N.T.), because not only men as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm" title="However, many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.">Acts 4:4</a>, but women also (Weiss), but Bengel “pluralis grandis: jam non initur numerus, uti 4, 4,” to the same effect Blass, “sæpe fiebat ut magnus numerus accederet, inde plur. hic tantum N.T.”.
