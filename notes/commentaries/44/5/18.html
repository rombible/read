The addition of the word “common” or “public” perhaps indicates a greater severity of treatment.

Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord are against them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will go on.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The common prison - The public prison; or the prison for the keeping of common and notorious offenders. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-23. sect of the Sadducees&#8212;See on [1953]Ac 4:1 for the reason why this is specified.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm" title="And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold to the next day: for it was now eventide.">Acts 4:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And laid their hands on the apostles,....

The whole of the twelve are now seized, for the authorities are roused to activity. It is clear from this that, though St Luke has only mentioned the speeches of Peter, with some slight notice that John also was a speaker, yet all the Apostles were busy, and could have been quoted as preachers and teachers had it been any part of the compiler’s purpose to write a history of all the Apostles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and put them in the common prison</span>] The noun is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-3.htm" title="And they laid hands on them, and put them in hold to the next day: for it was now eventide.">Acts 4:3</a>, and the notion—that of <span class="ital">ward</span>, as a place of temporary imprisonment till the formal summoning of the council next day—should here be preserved.

There is no article, moreover. Note, too, that another word is used for the prison in the next verse (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;).
