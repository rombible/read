The money was his own, to give the whole or part (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-4.htm" title="Whiles it remained, was it not your own? and after it was sold, was it not in your own power? why have you conceived this thing in your heart? you have not lied to men, but to God.">Acts 5:4</a>). But the formal act, apparently reproducing that of Barnabas, was an acted lie. The part was offered as if it were the whole. The word for “kept back” is rendered “purloining” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a>, and always carried with it the idea of stealthy and dishonest appropriation. It is used in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.">Joshua 7:1</a>, as describing the sin of Achan.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-11 The sin of Ananias and Sapphira was, that they were ambitious of being thought eminent disciples, when they were not true disciples. Hypocrites may deny themselves, may forego their worldly advantage in one instance, with a prospect of finding their account in something else. They were covetous of the wealth of the world, and distrustful of God and his providence. They thought they might serve both God and mammon. They thought to deceive the apostles. The Spirit of God in Peter discerned the principle of unbelief reigning in the heart of Ananias. But whatever Satan might suggest, he could not have filled the heart of Ananias with this wickedness had he not been consenting. The falsehood was an attempt to deceive the Spirit of truth, who so manifestly spoke and acted by the apostles. The crime of Ananias was not his retaining part of the price of the land; he might have kept it all, had he pleased; but his endeavouring to impose upon the apostles with an awful lie, from a desire to make a vain show, joined with covetousness. But if we think to put a cheat upon God, we shall put a fatal cheat upon our own souls. How sad to see those relations who should quicken one another to that which is good, hardening one another in that which is evil! And this punishment was in reality mercy to vast numbers. It would cause strict self-examination, prayer, and dread of hypocrisy, covetousness, and vain-glory, and it should still do so. It would prevent the increase of false professors. Let us learn hence how hateful falsehood is to the God of truth, and not only shun a direct lie, but all advantages from the use of doubtful expressions, and double meaning in our speech.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And kept back - The word used here means properly "to separate, to part:" and then it means to "separate surreptitiously or clandestinely for our own use" a part of public property, as taxes, etc. It is used but three times in the New Testament, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm">Acts 5:3</a>, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm">Titus 2:10</a>, where it is rendered "purloining."

Blass well comments: “in conventu ecclesiæ hoc liberalitatis documentum editum”; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Calvin, who in marking the ambition of Ananias to gain a reputation for liberality adds: “ita fit ut pedes Apostolorum magis honoret quam Dei oculos”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">and kept back part of the price</span>] i.e. while at the same time they professed to be bringing the whole sum into the common fund. The portion which was kept back was probably not large, for otherwise the general sense of the value of the land would have made it conspicuous. The word translated “kept back” is the same which is rendered <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-10.htm" title="Not purloining, but showing all good fidelity; that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior in all things.">Titus 2:10</a> <span class="ital">purloining</span>, and in classical Greek it has frequently the meaning <span class="ital">to rob</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">his wife also being privy to it</span>] This is mentioned to shew that the offence was an aggravated one, and had not been committed without deliberation and set purpose. She was a willing accomplice in the intended fraud.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles’ feet</span>] Thus professing equal devotion with all the others who were making sacrifices for the cause of the faith. We are not told what they hoped to gain by their act, whether in reputation among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved.">Acts 2:47</a>), or, by giving what was supposed to be their whole estate (which may be implied in the vague word <span class="ital">possession</span>), to procure for themselves in perpetuity a maintenance from the common funds. The former ambition was most probably what led to their offence. They thought more of the display made at the Apostles’ feet than of the offence before God’s eyes. And we know from St Peter’s Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-3.htm" title="And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time lingers not, and their damnation slumbers not.">2 Peter 2:3</a>) that it was soon foretold that men would arise in the Christian community, who “through covetousness would with feigned words make merchandise of” the society, and at a later date (Judges 11), these men are described as those who run “greedily after the error of Balaam for reward.” We may therefore be convinced that in the example of Ananias we have a typical instance of the kind of offence into which at this time the Christian community was in danger of being tempted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-2.htm" title="And kept back part of the price, his wife also being privy to it, and brought a certain part, and laid it at the apostles' feet.">Acts 5:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐνοσφίσατο</span>, <span class="ital">he fraudulently kept back</span>) The sin of Achan and that of Ananias were in many respects similar, at the beginning of the churches of the Old and New Testament respectively; and the same verb, <span class="greekheb">ἐνοσφίσατο</span>, <span class="ital">fraudulently appropriated</span> or <span class="ital">kept</span>, is used of Achan, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-1.htm" title="But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the children of Israel.">Joshua 7:1</a>. The former, however, in the Old Testament, according to the direction of God, was killed by the hand of men; the latter, in the New Testament, by the Divine hand, at the word of the apostle. The sin of Judas also was similar to that of Ananias.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς τιμῆς</span>, <span class="ital">of the price</span>) These two seem not to have believed that Christianity would last long.—<span class="greekheb">συνειδυίας</span>, <span class="ital">being conscious</span> of it) They sinned the more grievously, since they might have mutually dissuaded one another from the sin.—<span class="greekheb">ἐνέγκας μέρος τὶ</span>, <span class="ital">having brought a certain part</span>) just as if it were the whole.
