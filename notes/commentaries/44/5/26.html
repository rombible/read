Here, however, the Apostles set the example of unresisting acquiescence, even though the tide of feeling in their favour was so strong that they might have easily raised a tumult in their favour. The signs that had been recently wrought, perhaps also the lavish distribution of alms, the ideal communism of the disciples, were all likely, till counteracted by stronger influences, to secure popular favour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/5-26.htm" title="Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned....">Acts 5:26-28</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then went the captain with the officers </span>— By the direction of the sanhedrim; <span class="ital">and brought them </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ου μετα βιας</span>, <span class="ital">not by violence;</span> <span class="ital">for they feared the people, lest </span>— If they had offered any violence in their presence; <span class="ital">they should have been stoned </span>— The people were so fully persuaded that a divine power attended the apostles, that they held their persons sacred, and would not have borne any open attack upon them. “This may seem a surprising change in the people, considering the eagerness with which they demanded that Christ should be crucified. But it is exceedingly probable, that seeing the mighty power which wrought in the apostles, they might entertain some hope of obtaining temporal deliverance by their means, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm" title="When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?">Acts 1:6</a>,) of which they were so exceedingly fond; and a disappointment in their hope of which had turned their hosannas [addressed to Christ] into the cry, <span class="ital">Crucify him, crucify him.” And when they had brought them — </span>For the apostles made no opposition, but readily and cheerfully obeyed the summons, that they might repeat their testimony to their Divine Master, in the presence of the rulers; <span class="ital">they set them before the council </span>— In order to their examination. We may think, if God designed that the apostles should be thus seized, and brought before the sanhedrim a second time, why were they rescued from their first imprisonment? But that was intended to humble the pride, and check the fury of these their persecutors. <span class="ital">And the high-priest </span>— Singling out Peter and John, who had so lately been examined before the council; <span class="ital">asked them</span> — As the mouth of the court; <span class="ital">saying, Did we not straitly command you </span>— You two in particular, and so, in effect, all the rest of your company, and on pain of our highest displeasure; <span class="ital">that you should not teach in this name</span> — But you have disobeyed our commands, and go on to preach, not only without our license, but against our express order. See the poor cunning of the enemies of the gospel! They make laws and interdicts at their pleasure, which those who obey God cannot but break, and then they take occasion thereby to censure and punish the innocent as guilty. <span class="ital">And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine </span>— Your false and pernicious doctrine, and thereby have disturbed the public peace; <span class="ital">and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us </span>— An artful and invidious expression. The apostles did not desire to accuse any man; they simply declared the naked truth. Thus these rulers charged them, not only with contumacy, and contempt of the court, but with sedition and faction, and a plot to set the people against them, for having persecuted, even to death, not only so innocent, but so good and great a man as this Jesus.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:26-33 Many will do an evil thing with daring, yet cannot bear to hear of it afterward, or to have it charged upon them. We cannot expect to be redeemed and healed by Christ, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Faith takes the Saviour in all his offices, who came, not to save us in our sins, but to save us from our sins. Had Christ been exalted to give dominion to Israel, the chief priests would have welcomed him. But repentance and remission of sins are blessings they neither valued nor saw their need of; therefore they, by no means, admitted his doctrine. Wherever repentance is wrought, remission is granted without fail. None are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of sin; who are turned from it, and turned against it. Christ gives repentance, by his Spirit working with the word, to awaken the conscience, to work sorrow for sin, and an effectual change in the heart and life. The giving of the Holy Ghost, is plain evidence that it is the will of God that Christ should be obeyed. And He will surely destroy those who will not have Him to reign over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Without violence - Not by force; not by "binding" them. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>. The command of the Sanhedrin was sufficient to secure their presence, as they did not intend to refuse to answer for any alleged violation of the laws. Besides, their going before the council would give them another noble opportunity to bear witness to the truth of the gospel. Christians, when charged with a violation of the laws of the land, should not refuse to answer, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>, "If I be an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die." It is a part of our religion to yield obedience to all the just laws of the land, and to evince respect for all that are in authority, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>.<p>For they feared the people - The people were favorable to the apostles. If violence had been attempted, or they had been taken in a cruel and forcible manner, the consequence would have been tumults and bloodshed. In this way, also, the apostles showed that they were not disposed to excite tumult. Opposition by them would have excited commotion; and though "they" would have been rescued, yet they resolved to show that they were not obstinate, contumacious, or rebellious, but were disposed, as far as it could be done with a clear conscience, to yield obedience to the laws of the land, <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. without violence, for they feared, &c.&#8212;hardened ecclesiastics, all unawed by the miraculous tokens of God's presence with the apostles, and the fear of the mob only before their eyes!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Brought them without violence; </span> they might, peradventure, think it needless or impossible to bind <span class="ital">them</span> against their wills, who had opened the prison, and so miraculously came out: however, another more certain reason is given of it; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">they feared the people; </span> they feared men more than God, who had done so great things amongst them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then went the captain with the offcers,....
