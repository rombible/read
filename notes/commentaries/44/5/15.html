For some days or weeks the sick were laid all along the streets—the broad open streets, as distinct from the lanes and alleys (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.

Assuming that miracles are possible, and that the narratives of the Gospels indicate generally the laws that govern them, there is nothing in the present narrative that is not in harmony with those laws. Christ healed sometimes directly by a word, without contact of any kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-13.htm" title="And Jesus said to the centurion, Go your way; and as you have believed, so be it done to you.

All that was wanted was the expectation of an intense faith, as the subjective condition on the one side, the presence of an objective supernatural power on the other, and any medium upon which the imagination might happen to fix itself as a help to faith. So afterwards the “hand, kerchiefs and aprons” from St. Paul’s skin do what the shadow of St. Peter does here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>).

They brought the sick into the streets, because, as is probable, the priests would not suffer them to bring them into the temple to Solomon’s porch; and the apostles had not leisure to come to the houses of them all. And <span class="ital">they laid them on beds and couches</span> — Because they were so weak that they could neither walk nor stand, and in order that, if they could neither have access to Peter, nor he come to them, at least <span class="ital">the shadow of him passing by might overshadow some of them </span>— Though it could not reach them all, and they had faith to believe this would be the means of healing them. And it is probable that they were not disappointed, but that some, at least, were thus healed, as the woman mentioned in the gospel was, by touching Christ’s garment. According to their faith it was done unto them. And in this, among other things, the promise of Christ, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-12.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me, the works that I do shall he do also; and greater works than these shall he do; because I go to my Father.">John 14:12</a>,) <span class="ital">The works that I do, shall ye also do, and greater works than these, </span>&c., was eminently fulfilled. And if such miracles were wrought by Peter’s shadow, we have reason to think some were wrought in some such way by the other apostles; as by the handkerchiefs from Paul’s body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.

Thus opportunity was given to the apostles, both of convincing people’s judgments, by those miracles, of the heavenly origin of the doctrine they preached, and also of engaging people’s affections both to them and it, by giving them specimens of its manifest beneficial tendency.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:12-16 The separation of hypocrites by distinguishing judgments, should make the sincere cleave closer to each other and to the gospel ministry. Whatever tends to the purity and reputation of the church, promotes its enlargement; but that power alone which wrought such miracles by the apostles, can rescue sinners from the power of sin and Satan, and add believers to His worshippers.

Perhaps the sun was near setting, and the lengthened shadow of Peter might be thrown afar across the way. They were not able to approach him on account of the crowd, and they "imagined" that if they could "anyhow" come under his influence they might be healed. The sacred writer does not say, however, that any "were" healed in this way, nor that they were commanded to do this. He simply states the "impression" which was on the minds of the people that it "might be." Whether they were healed by this, it is left for us merely to conjecture. An instance somewhat similar is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm">Acts 19:12</a>, where it is expressly said, however, that the sick were healed by contact with "handkerchiefs" and "aprons" that were brought from the body of Paul. Compare also <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-21.htm">Matthew 9:21-22</a>, where the woman said respecting Jesus "If I may but touch his garment I shall be whole."<p>Might overshadow - That his shadow might pass over them. Though there is no certain evidence that any were healed in this way, yet it shows the full belief of the people that Peter had the power of working miracles. "Peter" was supposed by them to be eminently endowed with this power, because it was by him that the lame man in the temple had been healed <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4-6</a>, and because he had been most prominent in his addresses to the people. The persons who are specified in this verse were those who dwelt at Jerusalem. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. into the streets&#8212;"in every street."<p>on beds and couches&#8212;The words denote the softer couches of the rich and the meaner cribs of the poor [Bengel].<p>shadow of Peter &#8230; might overshadow some of them&#8212;Compare Ac 19:12; Lu 8:46.

These words are to be read in connection with the former part of the twelfth verse. Such miraculous cures being wrought by the apostles, the people who had sick persons in their houses, hearing of it brought them out; either "into the streets", as we render it, and as the Alexandrian copy reads; or "in every street" in Jerusalem, waiting for the apostles as they came, to receive a cure from them: <p>and laid them on beds and couches; for the better conveniency of carrying them to the apostles, or for their lying upon them until they came by that way: <p>that at the least, the shadow of Peter passing by, might overshadow some of them. The Vulgate Latin version adds, "and be delivered from their infirmities"; but this is not supported by any copy, nor is it in any other version. Peter is only mentioned because he was most known, he being the chief speaker and actor. Who these were that fancied there was such a virtue in Peter's shadow, and whether any were cured by it, is not certain. However, it is a vain thing in the Papists to conclude from hence the primacy of Peter, the worshipping of images, and that the Pope is Peter's shadow, and has his power. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Insomuch that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὥστε καὶ εἰς</span>, “insomuch that they even,” R.V.—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ</span>, T.R., so Alford, Meyer, “all down the streets,” as if the streets were entirely beset with sick folk (see Holtzmann, <span class="ital">in loco</span>).—<span class="greekheb">πλατείας</span>, feminine of the adjective <span class="greekheb">πλατύς</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁδός</span>, a broad way, so here, the open streets, in classical Greek, and frequently in LXX, chiefly for Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">רְחֹב</span>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/13-17.htm" title="And the streets of Jerusalem shall be paved with beryl and carbuncle and stones of Ophir.">Tob 13:17</a>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/1-14.htm" title="And became lord of his cities, and came unto Ecbatane, and took the towers, and spoiled the streets thereof, and turned the beauty thereof into shame.">Jdt 1:14</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/7-14.htm" title="So they and their wives and their children shall be consumed with fire, and before the sword come against them, they shall be overthrown in the streets where they dwell.">Jdt 7:14</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/7-22.htm" title="Therefore their young children were out of heart, and their women and young men fainted for thirst, and fell down in the streets of the city, and by the passages of the gates, and there was no longer any strength in them.">Jdt 7:22</a>, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-55.htm" title="And burnt incense at the doors of their houses, and in the streets.">1Ma 1:55</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-9.htm" title="Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy.">1Ma 2:9</a>, 3Ma 1:18, used by St. Luke three times in his Gospel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-26.htm" title="Men and brothers, children of the stock of Abraham, and whoever among you fears God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.">Acts 13:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-21.htm" title="And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch,">Acts 14:21</a>, but only here in Acts, see below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm" title="And the Lord said to him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for one called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prays,">Acts 9:11</a>.

Dr. Kennedy sees in <span class="greekheb">κλινίδιον</span> an instance of rare words used by the comic poets, especially Aristophanes, found also in the N.T., and almost nowhere else, and hence a proof of the “colloquial” language of the N.T. writers (<span class="ital">Sources of N.

Undoubtedly this action of the people showed the lively power of their faith (Chrys., Theod., Aug[174]), but the further question arises in spite of the severe strictures of Zeller, Overbeck, Holtzmann, as to how far the narrative indicates that the shadow of Peter actually produced the healing effects. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-16.htm" title="There came also a multitude out of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.">Acts 5:16</a> shows that the sick folk were all healed, but Zöckler maintains that there is nothing to show that St. Luke endorses the enthusiastic superstition of the people (so J. Lightfoot, Nösgen, Lechler, Rendall). On the other hand we may compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-56.htm" title="And wherever he entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and sought him that they might touch if it were but the border of his garment: and as many as touched him were made whole.">Mark 6:56</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-5.htm" title="As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.">John 9:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>; and Baumgarten’s comment should be considered that, although it is not actually said that a miraculous power went forth from Peter’s shadow, it is a question why, if no such power is implied, the words should be introduced at all into a narrative which evidently purports to note the extraordinary powers of the Apostles. The parallels just instanced from the Gospels could, of course, have no weight with critics who can only see in such comparisons a proof that the Acts cannot rise above the superstitious level of the Gospels, or who start like Renan with “an absolute rule of criticism,” <span class="ital">viz.</span>, the denial of a place in history to all miraculous narratives.

Peter is alone mentioned here because he was the most prominent figure, but we are not to conclude that no mighty works were done by the rest. These men who gave such an exhibition of faith have been described (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-14.htm" title="And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)">Acts 5:14</a></span>) as <span class="ital">believers in the Lord</span>. There can therefore be no question as to what they regarded as the power which was to heal their sick. They did not believe on Peter, though they magnified him as the Lord’s instrument; they did not ascribe healing power to Peter’s shadow, though it might please God to make that a sacrament of healing, as to Israel in old times He had made the brazen serpent. They had seen health bestowed through the Apostle by the name of Christ, and to demonstrate their faith in that name, they bring their afflicted friends into the way of salvation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὥστε</span>, <span class="ital">insomuch that</span>) This depends on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-12.htm" title="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.">Acts 5:12</a>, at the beginning [“And they were all—women,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-14.htm" title="And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.)">Acts 5:14</a>, being a parenthesis].—<span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὰς πλατείας</span>, <span class="ital">into</span>, or <span class="ital">along the streets</span>) [<span class="ital">secundum plateas</span>].
