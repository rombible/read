We cannot expect to be redeemed and healed by Christ, unless we give up ourselves to be ruled by him. Faith takes the Saviour in all his offices, who came, not to save us in our sins, but to save us from our sins. Had Christ been exalted to give dominion to Israel, the chief priests would have welcomed him. But repentance and remission of sins are blessings they neither valued nor saw their need of; therefore they, by no means, admitted his doctrine. Wherever repentance is wrought, remission is granted without fail. None are freed from the guilt and punishment of sin, but those who are freed from the power and dominion of sin; who are turned from it, and turned against it. Christ gives repentance, by his Spirit working with the word, to awaken the conscience, to work sorrow for sin, and an effectual change in the heart and life. The giving of the Holy Ghost, is plain evidence that it is the will of God that Christ should be obeyed. And He will surely destroy those who will not have Him to reign over them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When they heard that - That which the apostle Peter had said, to wit, that they were guilty of murder; that Jesus was raised up; and that he still lived as the Messiah.<p>They were cut to the heart - The word used here properly denotes "to cut with a saw"; and as applied to the "mind," it means to be agitated with "rage" and "indignation," as if wrath should seize upon the mind as a saw does upon wood, and tear it violently, or agitate it severely. When used in connection with "the heart," it means that the heart is violently agitated and rent with rage. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-54.htm">Acts 7:54</a>. It is not used elsewhere in the New Testament. The "reasons" why they were thus indignant were doubtless:<p>(1) Because the apostles had disregarded their command;<p>(2) Because they charged them with murder;<p>(3) Because they affirmed the doctrine of the resurrection of Jesus, and thus tended to overthrow the sect of the Sadducees. The effect of the doctrines of the gospel is often to make people enraged.<p>Took counsel - The word rendered "took counsel" denotes commonly "to will"; then, "to deliberate"; and sometimes "to decree" or "to determine." It doubtless implies here that "their minds "were made up" to do it; but probably the formal decree was not passed to put them to death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. cut to the heart and took&#8212;"were taking."<p>counsel to slay them&#8212;How different this feeling and the effect of it from that "pricking of the heart" which drew from the first converts on the day of Pentecost the cry, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"
