Recoveries from sickness, releases out of trouble, are granted, not that we may enjoy the comforts of life, but that God may be honoured with the services of our life. It is not for the preachers of Christ's gospel to retire into corners, as long as they can have any opportunity of preaching in the great congregation. They must preach to the lowest, whose souls are as precious to Christ as the souls of the greatest. Speak to all, for all are concerned. Speak as those who resolve to stand to it, to live and die by it. Speak all the words of this heavenly, divine life, in comparison with which the present earthly life does not deserve the name. These words of life, which the Holy Ghost puts into your mouth. The words of the gospel are the words of life; words whereby we may be saved. How wretched are those who are vexed at the success of the gospel! They cannot but see that the word and power of the Lord are against them; and they tremble for the consequences, yet they will go on.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The captain of the temple - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm">Acts 4:1</a>.<p>Doubted of them - They were in "perplexity" about these things. The word rendered "doubted" denotes "that state of anxiety which arises when a person has lost his way, or when he does not know what to do to escape from a difficulty." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7</a>.<p>Whereunto this would grow - What this "would be"; or, what would be the result or end of these events. For:<p>(1) Their authority was disregarded.<p>(2) God had opposed them by a miracle.<p>(3) the doctrines of the apostles were gaining ground.<p>(4) their efforts to resist them had been in vain. They need "not" have doubted; but sinners are not disposed to be convinced of the truth of religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-26. they doubted&#8212;"were in perplexity."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> So true is that in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-10.htm" title="Take counsel together, and it shall come to nothing; speak the word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.">Isaiah 8:10</a></span>, <span class="bld">Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought.</span> But, <span class="ital">The counsel of the Lord standeth for ever, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-11.htm" title="The counsel of the LORD stands for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations.">Psalm 33:11</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then came one and told them, saying,....
