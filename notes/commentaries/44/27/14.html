Grammatically the pronoun seems to refer to Crete, and if referred to it, the sentence admits of three possible constructions: (1) the wind <span class= "ital">drove us against</span> Crete; or (2), <span class= "ital">blew against</span> Crete; or (3), <span class= "ital">drove down on us from</span> Crete. Of these, (1) and (2) are at variance with the facts of the case, as the gale blew the ship away from Crete to the south, while (3), which is as tenable grammatically, exactly agrees with them. Some translators (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Luther) have, however, referred the pronoun to the noun “purpose,”—“the wind blew against their purpose;” but this gives a less satisfactory sense. Of the English versions Wiclif gives “was against it,” leaving the sense ambiguous. Tyndale and Cranmer follow Luther, “there arose against their purpose.” The Geneva adopts the first of the above readings, “there arose against Candie,” and is followed by the Rhemish, “drove against it.”<p><span class= "bld">A tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.</span>—The Greek adjective <span class= "ital">typhonic</span> is perpetuated in the modern “typhoon,” as applied to whirlwinds like that now described. The “vortex” of such a wind is indeed its distinguishing feature. The name <span class= "ital">Euroclydon, </span>which is fairly represented by such a word as “wide-wave,” or “broad-billow,” is not found elsewhere, and, if the reading be genuine, must be looked on as a term which St. Luke reported as actually used by the sailors on board. Some of the best MSS., however, give the form <span class= "ital">Euro-aquilo, </span>which, though a somewhat hybrid word unknown to Greek and Latin writers, fits in, as meaning north-east, or, more strictly, east by north, with all the phenomena described. The earlier English—Wiclif, Tyndale, Cranmer, and the Geneva—all give “north-east,” while the Rhemish reproduces the term <span class= "ital">Euro-aquilo, </span>without attempting to translate. A sudden change from south to north, with a great increase of violence, is a common phenomenon in the autumnal storms of the Mediterranean, and in this instance the blast would seem to have rushed down on the ship from the hills of Crete.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Arose - Beat violently.<p>Against it - Against the vessel.

Interpreters have been much perplexed about the meaning of this word, which occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. The most probable supposition is, that it denotes "a wind not blowing steadily from any quarter, but a hurricane, or wind veering about to different quarters." Such hurricanes are known to abound in the Mediterranean, and are now called Levanters, deriving their name from blowing chiefly in the Levant, or eastern part of the Mediterranean. The name euroclydon is derived probably from two Greek words, &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  euros, "wind," and &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  kludo&#772;n, "a wave"; so called from its agitating and exciting the waves. It thus answers to the usual effects of a hurricane, or of a wind rapidly changing its points of compass. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14, 15. a tempestuous&#8212;"typhonic"<p>wind&#8212;that is, like a typhon or tornado, causing a whirling of the clouds, owing to the meeting of opposite currents of air.<p>called Euroclydon&#8212;The true reading appears to be Euro-aquilo, or east-northeast, which answers all the effects here ascribed to it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">There arose against it; </span> Crete or Candia; so that they were in the greater danger, having a sea-shore. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Called Euroclydon; </span> this some will have to have been a whirlwind; but the word signifies only, the tempestuous east, or the north-east, which is a contrary wind unto any that would go from Crete to Italy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But not long after,.... They had not been long at sea, but <p>there arose against it; the ship, or the island of Crete, or both: <p>a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon; in the Greek text it is a "Typhonic" wind, so called, not from the name of a country from whence it blew; rather from Typho, the same with Python, an Heathen deity, who is said to be drowned in the lake Serbonis, or in the river Orontes; about which places this sort of wind is observed to be frequent, and which may take its name from him, being supposed to be raised by him. This wind may very well be thought to be the same which is called Typhon, and is by writers (s) represented as a very tempestuous one, as a sort of whirlwind or hurricane, a violent storm, though without thunder and lightning; and Pliny (t) calls it the chief plague of sailors, it breaking their sails, and even their vessels to pieces: and this may still have its name from Typho, since the Egyptians used to call everything that is pernicious and hurtful by this name; moreover, this wind is also called "Euroclydon". The Alexandrian copy reads, "Euracylon", and so the Vulgate Latin version seems to have read, rendering it "Euro-aquilo, the north east wind". The Ethiopic version renders it, the "north wind"; but according to Aristotle (u), and Pliny (w) the wind Typhon never blew in the northern parts; though some think that wind is not meant here, since the Typhon is a sudden storm of wind, and soon over; whereas this storm of wind was a settled and lasting one, it continued many days; and that it is only called Typhonic, because it bore some likeness to it, being very blustering and tempestuous: it seems by its name to be an easterly wind, which blew very violently, ploughed the sea, and lifted up its waves; hence the Arabic version renders it, "a mover" or "stirrer up of the waves"; which beat against the ship in a violent manner, and exposed it to great danger. <p>(s) Aristotel.

Thus the A. V. would state that the south wind, which already had begun to blow, became tempestuous, and dashed against the island. But if so, it must have carried the vessel with it. Whereas, what really happened was that they were driven southward to the island of Clauda. It is therefore better to take the preposition = <span class="ital">down from</span>, a sense which it often has in such a construction, than to give the verb the more literal meaning from the margin of A.

It is known in Greek by the name “Cœcias” and is a north-east wind. Some have thought that the reading of the A.

The form in the <span class="ital">Text Rec</span>. gives it a look of being all Greek, and the words “which is called” seem to intimate that the name was one known to the sailors, rather than a word of general use.

More strictly it is the <span class="ital">East-north-east</span>, the very wind which would drive a ship from Crete to the African Syrtis, according to the pilot’s fears, ver. 17.—E. and T.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> <span class="accented">- After no long time</span> for <span class="accented">not long after</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">beat down from</span> for <span class="accented">arose against</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">which is called Euraquilo</span> for <span class="accented">called Euroclydon</span>, A.V. and T.B. <span class="cmt_word">There beat down from it</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>). The meaning of this somewhat difficult phrase clearly is that given by Alford and Howson, and, on second thoughts, by Smith, viz. that a violent squall from the north-east beat down the heights and through the valleys of the island, becoming more violent when they had passed Cape Matala, and compelled them to alter their course, and run south-west before the wind towards the island of Clauda; <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> in a neuter sense, "struck," or "beat," or "fell," as in Homer (see Liddell and Scott). <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. Farrar thinks it "certain" that the right rendering is "against her," viz. the ship, because <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> could not be used with nothing to follow it," 1.e. he thinks you must say <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> something. But as <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> is the word used for the ship, not <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, it seems very difficult to suppose that Luke could say <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>, and not <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>. It is better, therefore, to refer <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> to <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;</span>, and either to understand it "down it," like <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x20;&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "down the heights of Olympus;" <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, "down the <span class="accented">rock</span>," etc., or simply "against <span class="accented">it</span>," as in the A.V., which obviates Dr. Farrar's objection. If taken in the sense of "down" there is the same idea of a squall "rushing down" from the hills into the lake, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-23.htm">Luke 8:23</a>; and again in ver. 33 of the same chapter St. Luke tells us how the swine rushed <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, "down the steep," into the lake. <span class="cmt_word">A tempestuous wind</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, only here, and not found in Greek writers; but the substantive <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, is common for a "furious storm" or "whirlwind." <span class="cmt_word">Euraquilo</span>. Compounded - after the analogy <span class="accented">of Euronotus</span>, the south-east wind - of <span class="accented">Eurus</span>, the east wind, and <span class="accented">Aquilo</span>, the north wind, both Latin words (like <span class="accented">Corns</span>, in ver. 12), though Eurus is also Greek. This reading of the R.T. is supported by the Vulgate, and by "Lachmann, Bornemann, Ewald, J. Smith, Hackett, Bentley, Olshausen, after Erasmus, Grotius, Mill, Bengel, and others" (Meyer), and by Wordsworth, Alford, Lid-dell and Scott, Factor. On the other hand, Meyer, Tischendorf, Dean Howson, and others support the reading of the T.R. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, and Lewis is doubtful. The derivation of <span class="accented">Euroelydon</span> would be from <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, a wave. Whatever its name was, it must have been a north-easter. Psalm evil. 25 naturally arises to one's remembrance, with its fine description of a storm at sea. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>There arose against it (&#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;' &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Against what? Some say, the island of Crete; in which case they would have been driven against the island, whereas we are told that they were driven away from it. Others, the ship. It is objected that the pronoun &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; it, is feminine, while the feminine noun for ship (&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2;) is not commonly used by Luke, but rather the neuter, &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;. I do not think this objection entitled to much weight. Luke is the only New Testament writer who uses &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-41.htm">Acts 27:41</a>), though he uses it but once; and, as Hackett remarks, "it would be quite accidental which of the terms would shape the pronoun at this moment, as they were both so familiar." A third explanation refers the pronoun to the island of Crete, and renders, "there beat down from it." This is grammatical, and according to a well-known usage of the preposition. The verb &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; is also used intransitively in the sense of to fall; thus Homer Iliad," xi., 722), of a river falling into the sea. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-37.htm">Mark 4:37</a> : "the the waves beat (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;) into the ship ;" and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-12.htm">Luke 15:12</a> the portion of goods that falleth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) to me." The rendering of the Rev. is, therefore, well supported, and, on the whole, preferable' there beat down from it. It is also according to the analogy of the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/8-23.htm">Luke 8:23</a>, there came down a storm. See note there, and see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-24.htm">Matthew 8:24</a>.<p>A tempestuous wind (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., a typhonic wind. The word &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; means a typhoon, and the adjective formed from it means of the character of a typhoon.<p>Euroclydon (&#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>The best texts read &#x395;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, Euraquilo: i.e., between Eurus, "the E. S. E. wind," and Aquilo, "the north-wind, or, strictly, N. 1/3 E." Hence, E. N. E. </body></html>
