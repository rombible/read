It lay on the Roman road from Assos and Troas to Pergamus, Ephesus, and Miletus. It was a port of considerable importance, and the Gulf of <span class= "ital">Adramyti</span> still retains its name. There would seem to have been but little direct intercourse by sea between Cæsarea and Rome, and the voyage had therefore to be made, now in one ship, now in another. Changes of this kind occurred, it will be remembered, in St. Paul’s journey from Philippi to Cæsarea. Possibly it was at first intended that the prisoners should go to Adramyttium, cross to Greece, and then proceed by land. “Asia” is, of course, the proconsular province so called. Looking to the fact that the “fast,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Day of Atonement (falling this year on Sept. 24th), was over when St. Paul reached Crete (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>), the date of embarkation may be fixed, with much probability, in the middle, or towards the end, of the previous August.<p><span class= "bld">One Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica.</span>—It is reasonable to infer that Aristarchus, who had come with St. Paul to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>), had remained in Palestine during the two years of the Apostle’s imprisonment, and was now intending to return to his native city. The subsequent alteration of plan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm" title="And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.">Acts 27:6</a>), however, led to his accompanying him to Rome, and we find him there with St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm" title=" Aristarchus my fellow prisoner salutes you, and Marcus, sister's son to Barnabas, (touching whom you received commandments: if he come to you, receive him;)">Colossians 4:10</a>, sharing his imprisonment.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:1-11 It was determined by the counsel of God, before it was determined by the counsel of Festus, that Paul should go to Rome; for God had work for him to do there. The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A ship of Adramyttium - A maritime town of Mysia, in Asia Minor, opposite to the island of Lesbos. This was a ship which had been built there, or which sailed from that port, but which was then in the port of Caesarea. It is evident, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-6.htm">Acts 27:6</a>, that this ship was not expected to sail to Italy, but that the centurion expected to find some other vessel into which he could put the prisoners to take them to Rome.<p>We launched - We loosed from our anchorage, or we set sail. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>.<p>By the coasts of Asia - Of Asia Minor. Probably the owners of the ship designed to make a coasting voyage along the southern part of Asia Minor, and to engage in traffic with the maritime towns and cities.<p>One Aristarchus, a Macedonian - This man is mentioned as Paul's companion in travel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>. He afterward attended him to Macedonia, and returned with him to Asia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>. He now appears to have attended him, not as a prisoner, but as a voluntary companion, choosing to share with him his dangers, and to enjoy the benefit of his society and friendship. He went with him to Rome, and was a fellow-prisoner with him there <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and is mentioned Plm 1:24 as Paul's fellow-laborer. It was doubtless a great comfort to Paul to have with him two such valuable friends as Luke and Aristarchus; and it was an instance of great affection for him that they were not ashamed of his bonds, but were willing to share his dangers, and to expose themselves to peril for the sake of accompanying him to Rome. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. a ship of&#8212;belonging to.<p>Adramyttium&#8212;a port on the northeast coast of the &AElig;gean Sea.

Here both these places are mentioned in connection with his name. After this we find him at Rome with the apostle (Col 4:10; Phm 24).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Adramyttium; </span> a city in Mysia, a province in the Lesser Asia, almost over against Mitylene, of a pestilent air. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; </span> the ship did belong to Adramyttium, and designed a trading voyage along the coasts of Asia. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Aristarchus; </span> this Aristarthus seems to have been a man of some note, who accompanied St. Paul (together with Luke, the holy penman of this book, and of the Gospel so called) throughout his journey, and none else that we read of.

Which was in the port of Caesarea; for from thence they set sail to the place where this ship was bound, which very likely was the place here mentioned; there was a city of this name in Africa, and which was built upon the sea shore, and is sometimes called Hadrumentum (g), as this is called Adramantos, in the Syriac version; and in the Alexandrian copy, and in another manuscript, "a ship of Adramyntum"; it is mentioned with Carthage, a city in Africa, by Pliny (h) and Solinus (i); the one calls it Adrumetum, and the other Adrymeto; and the latter says, that it, as well as Carthage, was built by the people of Tyre; and so Sallust (k) says, that the Phoenicians built Hippo, Adrumetum, Leptis, and other cities on the sea coast; and the name seems to be a Phoenician name,  "Hadarmuth", which signifies "the court of death"; perhaps it might be so called, either from the badness of the air in which it was, or the dangerousness of its haven: Jerom calls it Hadrumetus, and says (l) it is a city in Byzacium, a country in Africa; he seems to design another place, the metropolis of the Byzacian country, the most fruitful of all the parts of Africa, and which in the Phoenician language was "Hadarmeoth"; which signifies "the court of a hundred"; that is, it was a place so fruitful that it brought forth an hundred fold; and agreeably to which is what Pliny says (m), they are called Libyphoenicians, who inhabit Byzacium, a country so named, in circuit two hundred and fifty miles, and of such great fruitfulness that the land returns to the husbandmen an hundred fold. The former of these is most likely to be the place here meant; and though we nowhere read of the apostle being here, nor of the Gospel being preached here in the early times of Christianity; yet in the "fourth" century there was a church in this place, and Philologus was bishop of it, who subscribed at a council held at Carthage in this century; and in the "fifth" century we read of several bishops of this place, as Aurelius, who was in the Chalcedon council, Flavianus in that at Ephesus, which was reckoned an infamous one, and Helladius, who was in the first Ephesine council, and Felix, who was banished by Gensericus (n). There was another city of the same name in Aeolia, or Mysia (o), and which was formerly called Pedasus, and since Landermiti, and was a seaport, and bids fair to be the place here intended; though since there was an island of Lycia called Adramitis (p), now Audromety, and it was at Myra, a city of Lycia, where this ship stopped, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-5.htm">Acts 27:5</a> and where the passengers changed their ship, this seems most likely to be designed: <p>we launched; in the said ship from Caesarea: <p>meaning to sail by the coast of Asia; the lesser Asia, along by Ephesus and Miletus, as they did; for in this last place, as before observed, Trophimus was left sick; the Alexandrian copy reads,  "that was about to sail"; that is, the ship of Adramyttium was about to sail, or just ready to sail by the coast of Asia, wherefore the company entered, and set forth in it on their voyage: <p>one Aristarchus a Macedonian, of Thessalonica, being with us; the same person that was with the apostle at Ephesus, and accompanied him into Asia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a> the same went through with him to Rome, and became his fellowlabourer, and fellow prisoner there, Plm 1:24 <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>. <p>(g) Mela, l. 1. c. 7.

She was now on her homeward voyage. <span class="cmt_word">Aristarchus</span>. He is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-29.htm">Acts 19:29</a>, as a Macedonian, and one of Paul's companions at Ephesus, pro-badly, therefore, the fruit of his first visit to Thessalonica. We find him again with St, Paul on his last journey from Corinth to Asia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm">Acts 20:4</a>), and we gather from the present notice of him that he kept with him till he arrived at Jerusalem, and followed him to Caesarea. It would appear at first sight, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, that he not only stayed with St. Paul during his two years' imprisonment at Rome, but was his "fellow-prisoner," if at least the word <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3bc;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> to be taken literally. This, however, is very doubtful, because in the Epistle to the Romans (Romans 16:7) St. Paul calls Andronicus and Junius his "fellow-prisoners," though he was not then in prison himself; and also because, in the Epistle to Philemon (Philemon 1:23, 24), he gives this epithet to Epaphras, with the addition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x1f38;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> ("my fellow-prisoner in Christ Jesus"), and does not give it to Aristarchus, who is named in the same sentence as his <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (see Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>, and Bishop Ellicott, on ibid.).
