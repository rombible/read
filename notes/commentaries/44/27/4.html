The course they steered, and the places they touched at, are here set down. And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice. But the event will convince sinners of the vanity of their hopes, and the folly of their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We sailed under Cyprus - For an account of Cyprus, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-36.htm">Acts 4:36</a>. By sailing "under Cyprus" is meant that they sailed along its coasts; they kept near to it; they thus endeavored to break off the violent winds. Instead of steering a direct course in the open sea, which would have exposed them to violent opposing winds, they kept near this large island, so that it was between them and the westerly winds. The force of the wind was thus broken, and the voyage was rendered less difficult and dangerous. They went between Cyprus and Asia Minor, leaving Cyprus to the left. A sailor would express the idea by saying that they sailed under the lee of Cyprus. Had it not been for the strong western winds, they would have left it on the right.<p>The winds were contrary - Were from the west, or southwest, which thus prevented their pursuing a direct course. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. when we had launched&#8212;"set sail."<p>from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary&#8212;The wind blowing from the westward, probably with a touch of the north, which was adverse, they sailed under the lee of Cyprus, keeping it on their left, and steering between it and the mainland of Phœnicia.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Launched; </span> or put to sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cyprus; </span> a noted island in the Mediterranean Sea, of which we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-19.htm" title="Now they which were scattered abroad on the persecution that arose about Stephen traveled as far as Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, preaching the word to none but to the Jews only.">Acts 11:19</a> 13:4</span>.
