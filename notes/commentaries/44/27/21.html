With the feeling natural to one whose counsel had been slighted, he reminds them that if they had followed it they would have been spared the harm and loss (the same words are used in the Greek as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-10.htm" title="And said to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.">Acts 27:10</a>) to which they were now exposed. “Sirs,” as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:">Acts 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-25.htm" title="Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, you know that by this craft we have our wealth.">Acts 19:25</a>, answers to the Greek for “men.”<p><span class= "bld">And to have gained this harm and loss.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">to have been spared.</span> The English reads as if the words were ironical, but parallel passages from other Greek writers show that to “gain” a harm and loss meant to escape them—to get, as it were, a profit out of them by avoiding them. This, St. Paul says, they would have done had they listened to his advice. The Geneva version adds an explanatory note, “that is, ye should have saved the losse by avoyding the danger.” Tyndale and Cranmer take the words as the English reader, for the most part, takes them now, “and have brought unto us this harm and loss.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:21-29 They did not hearken to the apostle when he warned them of their danger; yet if they acknowledge their folly, and repent of it, he will speak comfort and relief to them when in danger. Most people bring themselves into trouble, because they do not know when they are well off; they come to harm and loss by aiming to mend their condition, often against advice. Observe the solemn profession Paul made of relation to God. No storms or tempests can hinder God's favour to his people, for he is a Help always at hand. It is a comfort to the faithful servants of God when in difficulties, that as long as the Lord has any work for them to do, their lives shall be prolonged. If Paul had thrust himself needlessly into bad company, he might justly have been cast away with them; but God calling him into it, they are preserved with him. They are given thee; there is no greater satisfaction to a good man than to know he is a public blessing. He comforts them with the same comforts wherewith he himself was comforted. God is ever faithful, therefore let all who have an interest in his promises be ever cheerful. As, with God, saying and doing are not two things, believing and enjoying should not be so with us. Hope is an anchor of the soul, sure and stedfast, entering into that within the veil. Let those who are in spiritual darkness hold fast by that, and think not of putting to sea again, but abide by Christ, and wait till the day break, and the shadows flee away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But after long abstinence - By the violence of the storm, by their long continued labor, and by their apprehension of danger, they had a long time abstained from food.<p>And to have gained this harm - To have procured this harm, or have subjected yourselves to it.

But the storm may also have prevented the preparation of food (so Smith, Ramsay, Page, Farrar); the former gives instances to show that <span class="greekheb">ἀσιτία</span> was one of the most frequent concomitants of heavy gales, owing to the impossibility of cooking food, and to the destruction of provisions by leakage. <span class="greekheb">ἀσιτίας</span>, see below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-33.htm" title="And while the day was coming on, Paul sought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.">Acts 27:33</a>, for the adjective: both noun and adjective peculiar to St. Luke, and much employed in medical language, both so noted by Hobart and Zahn, the noun often meaning “want of appetite,” see instances in Hobart, p. 276, Hipp., Galen, Aret.

Read (with <span class="ital">R. V.</span>) “when they had been long without food.” This was in consequence of the excitement which made it impossible to eat, as well as the condition of the vessel which made the preparation of food very difficult.

There is nothing about "long abstinence" in the text, nor does the verb <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> admit of being translated "<span class="accented">when</span> they had been." It describes a <span class="accented">present</span> condition. The literal rendering is, <span class="accented">when there was a great</span> (or, <span class="accented">general</span>) <span class="accented">loss of appetite</span> among the crew. The terror, the discomfort, the sea-sickness, the constant pressure of danger and labor, the difficulty of cooking, the unpalatableness of the food, combined to take away relish of their food, and they were becoming weak for want of nourishment. <span class="cmt_word">Have gotten</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). Schleusner, Bengel, Meyer, Alford, and the 'Speaker's Commentary' explain this as equivalent to "have avoided," or "have escaped," and quote Josephus ('Ant. Jud,' it. 3:2), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, "To avoid staining their hands;" and ' Bell. Jud.,' it. 16:4 (towards the close of Agrippa's speech), <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f25;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>," You will gain (i.e. avoid) the disgrace of defeat," like the use in Latin of <span class="accented">lucrifacere.</span> But it is simpler on the whole to understand it in the sense of "getting" as the fruit of your own conduct. We should say in English, "What have yon gained by this? Nothing but loss and shame." Compare too the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3a4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c8;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm">Romans 6:23</a>). So Liddell and Scott give us one use of <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">to</span> gain a loss, 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> reap disadvantage, and quote from Euripides, 'Hecuba,' 1. 518 (516, Scholefield), <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fb6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b4;&#x1fb6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "to gain double weeping." <span class="cmt_word">Injury</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f55;&#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>); see ver. 10, note.
