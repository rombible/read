The sailing season with the Jews was reckoned from the Feast of Pentecost to that of Tabernacles, which fell five days after the Fast. Roman reckoning gave a somewhat wider range,<span class= "ital"> sc., </span>from the sixth day of the Ides of March to the third of the Ides of November. The manner in which St. Luke names the Fast, and not the Feast of Tabernacles, makes it probable that the time to which we are now come was between September 24th and October 1st, when the Etesian winds, which are always of the nature of equinoctial gales, would naturally be most violent. Probably, also, the date may have been fixed on St. Luke’s memory by St. Paul’s observance of the Fast. He was not likely to leave so memorable a day unregarded, however little he might care to impose its observance upon others. To keep the Feast of Tabernacles on board the ship was, of course, impossible.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/27.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,...">Acts 27:9-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now when much time was spent </span>— In making this little way, and the season of the year was so far advanced, that <span class="ital">sailing was now dangerous </span>— On account of the tempestuous weather usual at that season: for <span class="ital">the fast </span>— Of the seventh month, or anniversary expiation; <span class="ital">was now past </span>— And consequently winter was coming on apace. It may be proper to observe, that the fast here spoken of was the day of atonement, which was ordered to be kept on the 10th day of the 7th month, called Tisri by the Jews, and consequently must have been about the 25th of our September. Philo, in several passages quoted by Dr. Whitby in his note here, speaks of this as an ill time for sailing, as Aratus also does; and it would naturally be so, not only on account of winter approaching, but also because of the flows that are still well known in the Mediterranean. <span class="ital">Paul admonished them </span>— Not to leave Crete. “Even in external things,” says Bengelius, “faith exerts itself with the greatest presence of mind, and readiness of advice.” <span class="ital">And said unto them </span>— Namely, to the centurion and other officers; <span class="ital">I perceive that this voyage </span>— If it be pursued according to the present scheme you have in view; <span class="ital">will be with hurt and much damage</span> — Paul seems to have given them this warning, not so much because of the time of the year, and the tempests usually attending it, as by a prophetical spirit. God, intending to preserve and honour Paul in this tedious and difficult voyage, endues him with the gift of prophecy; which, when they saw it verified, could not but beget in them a great respect for him, and was probably the means of salvation to many that were in the ship with him; <span class="ital">not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives — </span>So it would have been; their lives would have been lost, as well as the ship and goods, had not God given the lives of all in the ship unto Paul, and saved them for his sake.

And God here encourages those who suffer for him, to trust in him; for he can put it into the hearts of those to befriend them, from whom they least expect it. Sailors must make the best of the wind: and so must we all in our passage over the ocean of this world. When the winds are contrary, yet we must be getting forward as well as we can. Many who are not driven backward by cross providences, do not get forward by favourable providences. And many real Christians complain as to the concerns of their souls, that they have much ado to keep their ground. Every fair haven is not a safe haven. Many show respect to good ministers, who will not take their advice.

That was on the tenth of the month Tisri, which answers to a part of September and part of October. It was, therefore, the time of the autumnal equinox, and when the navigation of the Mediterranean was esteemed to be particularly dangerous, from the storms which usually occurred about that time. The ancients regarded this as a dangerous time to navigate the Mediterranean. See the proofs in Kuinoel on this place.<p>Paul admonished them - Paul exhorted, entreated, or persuaded them. He was somewhat accustomed to the navigation of that sea, and endeavored to persuade them not to risk the danger of sailing at that season of the year. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. when much time was spent&#8212;since leaving C&aelig;sarea.

Since all hope of completing the voyage during that season was abandoned, the question next was, whether they should winter at Fair Havens, or move to Port Phenice, a harbor about forty miles to the westward. Paul assisted at the consultation and strongly urged them to winter where they were.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This <span class="ital">fast</span> was not any necessitated abstinence, but a religious fast, as the word here used does most commonly signify; and the article being put to it, it may well denote some eminent and known fast.

Judas of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm">Acts 5:37</a>) drew "much" people after him; the Jews at Damascus conspired to kill Saul after "many" days were fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-23.htm">Acts 9:23</a>); Paul and Barnabas abode "long time" at Iconium (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm">Acts 14:3</a>); Paul talked a "long" while at Tress (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>); and they sailed slowly off the coast of Asia "many" days (ver. 7); the length, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the "sufficiency" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>) must depend in each case upon the standard by which it is measured.

The great Jewish fast on the Day of Atonement, in the month Tisri, which fell this year on September 24 (Lewin and Farrar), probably while they were at Fair Havens. The Jews considered navigation unsafe between the Feast of Tabernacles (five days after the Day of Atonement) and the Feast of Pentecost (Lewin, vol. it. p. 192, note). It became, therefore, a very serious question what they were to do. Fair Havens was an inconvenient anchorage for the winter, and not near any large town. On the other hand, if they passed beyond the shelter of Cape Matala, which lay a few miles to the east, and where the coast of Crete suddenly trends due north, they would be exposed to the violence of the Eterian westerly wind.
