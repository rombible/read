Here they got under the lee of the shore, and availed themselves of the temporary shelter to prepare the ship more thoroughly than had been possible before to encounter the fury of the storm. The first step was to get the boat, which hitherto apparently had been towed through the waves, on board the ship.

Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And running under - Running near to an island.

Breusing, pp. 167, 168, 181, thinks that the great sail had been struck at once, and that the artemon or small foresail was kept up as a storm sail; otherwise the ship would have been simply the plaything of the waves. But Ramsay and others (see Farrar) think, on the contrary, that the one huge sail, in comparison with which all others were of little importance, was kept up, but that the strain of this great sail on the single mast was more than the hull could sustain; the timbers would have started, and the ship foundered, had she not gained the smooth water to the lee of Cauda.—<span class="greekheb">μόλις ἰσχύσ</span>.: “we were able with difficulty to secure the boat,” R.V., the boat had not been hauled in, as the storm was so sudden; and now as it was nearly filled with water, and battered by the waves and storm, it was hard work to haul it in at all (J. Smith), as Luke himself experienced (pressed into this service of hauling in the boat; note first person, Hackett, Ramsay, p. 327); clearly they could not afford to lose such a means of safety; even as it was, the boat was dragging along as a heavy weight retarding the ship (Breusing, p. 169).—<span class="greekheb">περικ</span>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> Susannah, ver. 39, A, for <span class="greekheb">ἐγκρατεῖς</span> in .—<span class="greekheb">σκάφης</span>: a small boat towed behind, only in this passage in N.T., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-30.htm" title="And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the bow,">Acts 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-32.htm" title="Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.">Acts 27:32</a>, Latin, <span class="ital">scapha;</span> Cic., <span class="ital">De Invent.</span>, ii., 51 (Humphry).—<span class="greekheb">Κλαύδην</span>, see critical note, an island twenty-three miles from Crete, nearly due south of Phœnice.

The word for “island” is here in the original a diminutive form, hence “small island.” The name “Cauda” which has the best MS. support agrees well with the form which the name has assumed in modern times, “Gozzo” and “Gaudo.” But the form in A.V. is warranted by the orthography of Ptolemy (Claudos) and Pliny (Glaudos).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">we had much work to come by the boat</span>] This is most idiomatic old English, but is changed in <span class="ital">R.

In stormy weather, there was of course much danger that the boat would be washed away. This was the case here, and as soon as ever they had gained the shelter of the island, they set about making sure of its safety by hauling it on board, but this they were not able to do without much difficulty, probably because it had been already filled with water.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-16.htm" title="And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to come by the boat:">Acts 27:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περικρατεῖς γένεσθαι τῆς σκαφῆς</span>) <span class="ital">to retain</span>, and haul out of the sea, <span class="ital">the boat</span>, which heretofore had accompanied the ship: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-30.htm" title="And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the bow,">Acts 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-32.htm" title="Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.">Acts 27:32</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> <span class="accented">- Under the lee of</span> for <span class="accented">under</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">small</span> for <span class="accented">certain</span>, A.V.
