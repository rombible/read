They effected, in this way, the relief of the ship from the imminent danger of sinking. The act shows that, in spite of the undergirding, leakage was still going on. The cargo, as coming from Alexandria, probably consisted largely of corn; but see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-38.htm" title="And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, and cast out the wheat into the sea.">Acts 27:38</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They lightened the ship - By throwing out a part of the cargo. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. undergirding the ship&#8212;that is, passing four or five turns of a cable-laid rope round the hull or frame of the ship, to enable her to resist the violence of the seas, an operation rarely resorted to in modern seamanship.<p>fearing lest they should fall into the quicksands&#8212;"be cast ashore" or "stranded upon the Syrtis," the Syrtis Major, a gulf on the African coast, southwest of Crete, the dread of mariners, owing to its dangerous shoals.<p>they strake&#8212;"struck"<p>sail&#8212;This cannot be the meaning, for to strike sail would have driven them directly towards the Syrtis.

For the lightening of the vessel in distress, in order to make it go less deep and to keep it from grounding, they got rid in the first instance of what could, in the circumstances, be most fitly dispensed with, namely, the cargo; but on the day after they laid hands even on the <span class="greekheb">σκευὴ τοῦ πλοίου</span> (Diod. Sic. xiv. 79), <span class="ital">i.e. the ship’s apparatus</span>,—the utensils belonging to the ship, as furniture, beds, cooking vessels, and the like. The same collective idea, but expressed in the plural, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-5.htm" title="Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man to his god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.">Jonah 1:5</a>. Others (Wetstein, Kypke, Rosenmüller, Kuinoel) understand <span class="ital">the baggage of the passengers</span>, but this is at variance with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πλοίου</span>; instead of it we should expect <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, especially as <span class="greekheb">αὐτόχειρες</span> precedes. Following the Vulgate, Erasmus, Grotius, and many others, including Olshausen and Ewald, understand the <span class="ital">arma navis</span>, that is, ropes, beams, and the like belonging to the equipment of the ship. But the tackling is elsewhere called <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὅπλα</span>, or <span class="greekheb">τὰ σκεύη</span> (from <span class="greekheb">σκεῦος</span>), and just amidst the danger this was most indispensable of all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτόχειρες</span>] <span class="ital">with our own hands</span> (Hermann, <span class="ital">ad Soph.

The ship was without doubt a merchant-vessel, and doubtless had no ballast at all.

Others include under the word the actual baggage of the passengers, but we should have expected <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ πλοίου</span>, whilst others explain of beds and crockery, tables, etc., furniture in this sense (Zöckler and Felten, exclusive of beds which were not in use). Breusing rejects this interpretation as “too silly,” and he thinks that the expression really means that by thus throwing overboard the poles and tackling, room was found for the crowd of passengers on the deck, as the hatchways could not be kept open, since the heavy sea would have swamped the ship, p. 186. J.
