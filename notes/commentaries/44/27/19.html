If we accept the Received text, the fact that the passengers as well as the crew were pressed into the service indicates the urgency of the peril; but even with the other reading, the words describe the prompt spontaneous action caused by a strong sense of danger. The Greek word for “tackling” (better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">furniture</span>) is wider in its range than the English, and includes the beds and personal luggage and movables of all kinds. Even these the sailors were ready to sacrifice for the chance of safety.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:12-20 Those who launch forth on the ocean of this world, with a fair gale, know not what storms they may meet with; and therefore must not easily take it for granted that they have obtained their purpose. Let us never expect to be quite safe till we enter heaven. They saw neither sun nor stars for many days. Thus melancholy sometimes is the condition of the people of God as to their spiritual matters; they walk in darkness, and have no light. See what the wealth of this world is: though coveted as a blessing, the time may come when it will be a burden; not only too heavy to be carried safely, but heavy enough to sink him that has it. The children of this world can be prodigal of their goods for the saving their lives, yet are sparing of them in works of piety and charity, and in suffering for Christ. Any man will rather make shipwreck of his goods than of his life; but many rather make shipwreck of faith and a good conscience, than of their goods. The means the sailors used did not succeed; but when sinners give up all hope of saving themselves, they are prepared to understand God's word, and to trust in his mercy through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tackling of the ship - The anchors, sails, cables, baggage, etc. That is, everything that was not indispensable to its preservation, for it seems still <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-29.htm">Acts 27:29</a> that they retained some of their anchors on board. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19, 20. cast out with our own hands&#8212;passengers and crew together.<p>the tackling of the ship&#8212;whatever they could do without that carried weight.

Breusing rejects the first person, p. 187, from a seaman’s point of view; the sailors would have kept the passengers in their places, and not have allowed them to engage in a work in which they might perchance have done more harm than good.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">19</span>. <span class="ital">we cast out with our own hands</span>] The oldest MSS., with <span class="ital">R.

The word seems to mark that the sacrifice was very great, implying a very pressing danger. <span class="cmt_word">The tackling</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>). There is great difference of opinion as to what the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> means here. Smith thinks the main spar is meant, "the huge mainyard," and Farrar adopts his view, which he thinks is strengthened by the use of the aorist <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span> (for he adopts the T.R.), implying one single act, and showing, by the use of the first person, that it was the act of the whole crew united. Alford thinks that it means all the furniture, beds, and movables of all kinds, and <span class="accented">so</span> Wordsworth and Meyer. Wetstein explains it of the passengers' baggage. Howson thinks it unlikely they would have thrown away a great spar which would have supported twenty or thirty men in the water in the event of the ship foundering. Schleusner renders it "apparatus quo navis erat instructa." <span class="greek">&#x3a3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> is not used elsewhere in the New Testament, and it is difficult to speak decisively. But the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and the general use of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x1f75;</span> in classical Greek favors the interpretation "the ship's furniture" ("meubles et ustensiles," Renan). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Tackling (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>The word means equipment, furniture. The exact meaning here is uncertain. Some suppose it to refer to the main-yard; an immense spar which would require the united efforts of passengers and crew to throw overboard. It seems improbable, however, that they would have sacrificed so large a spar, which, in case of shipwreck, would support thirty or forty men in the water. The most generally received opinion is that it refers to the furniture of the ship - beds, tables, chests, etc. </body></html>
