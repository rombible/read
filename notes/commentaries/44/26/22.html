It implies the kind of assistance which one friend or ally gives to another of inferior power.

Here the word seems used as being more intelligible to those who are outside the kingdom of God than the more spiritual, more theological, “grace” of which the Apostle habitually spoke.<p><span class= "bld">Witnessing both to small and great.</span>—The English version gives the right rendering of the best supported reading. Some MSS., however, have “witnessed to by small and great;” but this, besides the want of authority, and its involving an unusual construction, is at variance with the context. It was true that St. Paul’s life was spent in bearing witness that Jesus was Christ. It was not true that he had a good report of all men. The words “small and <span class= "ital">great”</span> were significant as spoken when he was standing before two men like Festus and Agrippa. The phrase may be noted as occurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-10.htm" title="To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.">Acts 8:10</a>, and again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-18.htm" title="And the nations were angry, and your wrath is come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that you should give reward to your servants the prophets, and to the saints, and them that fear your name, small and great; and should destroy them which destroy the earth.">Revelation 11:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm" title="And he causes all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their foreheads:">Revelation 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-5.htm" title="And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God, all you his servants, and you that fear him, both small and great.">Revelation 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm" title="That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.">Revelation 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm" title="And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.">Revelation 20:12</a>.<p><span class= "bld">The prophets and Moses.</span>—The more natural order of “Moses and the prophets” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" title="Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.">Luke 16:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-31.htm" title="And he said to him, If they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded, though one rose from the dead.">Luke 16:31</a>), and the order of the words in the Greek, <span class= "ital">which the</span> <span class= "ital">prophets said should come, and Moses, </span>suggests the thought that the sentence would have stopped naturally at “come,” and that the name of Moses was added by an instantaneous after-thought to meet the case of those among the hearers who, like the Sadducees, placed the Pentateuch on a higher level of authority than the Prophets.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:12-23 Paul was made a Christian by Divine power; by a revelation of Christ both to him and in him; when in the full career of his sin. He was made a minister by Divine authority: the same Jesus who appeared to him in that glorious light, ordered him to preach the gospel to the Gentiles. A world that sits in darkness must be enlightened; those must be brought to know the things that belong to their everlasting peace, who are yet ignorant of them. A world that lies in wickedness must be sanctified and reformed; it is not enough for them to have their eyes opened, they must have their hearts renewed; not enough to be turned from darkness to light, but they must be turned from the power of Satan unto God. All who are turned from sin to God, are not only pardoned, but have a grant of a rich inheritance. The forgiveness of sins makes way for this. None can be happy who are not holy; and to be saints in heaven we must be first saints on earth. We are made holy, and saved by faith in Christ; by which we rely upon Christ as the Lord our Righteousness, and give up ourselves to him as the Lord our Ruler; by this we receive the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and eternal life. The cross of Christ was a stumbling-block to the Jews, and they were in a rage at Paul's preaching the fulfilling of the Old Testament predictions. Christ should be the first that should rise from the dead; the Head or principal One. Also, it was foretold by the prophets, that the Gentiles should be brought to the knowledge of God by the Messiah; and what in this could the Jews justly be displeased at? Thus the true convert can give a reason of his hope, and a good account of the change manifest in him. Yet for going about and calling on men thus to repent and to be converted, vast numbers have been blamed and persecuted.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having therefore obtained help of God - Paul had seen and felt his danger. He had known the determined malice of the Jews, and their efforts to take his life. He had been rescued by Lysias, and had made every effort himself to avoid the danger and to save his life; and at the end of all; he traced his safety entirely to the help of God. It was not by any power of his own that he had been preserved; it was because God had interposed and rescued him. Those who have been delivered from danger, if they have just views, will delight to trace it all to God. They will recognize his hand, and will feel that whatever wisdom they may have had, or whatever may have been the kindness of their friends to them, yet that all this also is to be traced to the superintending providence of God.<p>Witnessing - Bearing testimony to what he had seen, according to the command of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>.<p>To small - To those in humble life; to the poor, the ignorant, and the obscure. Like his Master, he did not despise them, but regarded it as his duty and privilege to preach the gospel to them.<p>And great - The rich and noble; to kings, princes, and governors. He had thus stood on Mars' Hill at Athens; he had declared the same gospel before Felix, Festus, and now before Agrippa. He offered salvation to all. He passed by none because they were poor; and he was not deterred by the fear of the rich and the great from making known their sins and calling them to repeatance. What an admirable illustration of the proper duties of a minister of the gospel!<p>Saying none other things ... - Delivering no new doctrine, but maintaining only that the prophecies had been fulfilled. As he had done this only, there was no reason for the opposition and persecution of the Jews.<p>Should come - Should come to pass, or should take place. Paul here evidently means to say that the doctrine of the atonement, and of the resurrection of Christ, is taught in the Old Testament. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22, 23. having obtained help&#8212;"succor."<p>from God&#8212;"that [which cometh] from God."<p>I continue&#8212;"stand," "hold my ground."<p>unto this day, witnessing, &c.&#8212;that is, This life of mine, so marvellously preserved, in spite of all the plots against it, is upheld for the Gospel's sake; therefore I "witnessed," &c.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I continue unto this day:</span> that Paul, continued till then alive, notwithstanding all the fraud and force of his enemies, is acknowledged by him to be from God; from whence he infers towards his justification, that what he had done was but in a becoming gratitude towards that God who had maintained him in life unto that very day. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Witnessing both to small and great; </span> witnessing to all sorts, princes or people; implying, that the truths of the gospel, and the things of God, concerned Agrippa as well as the meanest of his auditors; and indeed with God there is no respect of persons, and that <span class="ital">we are all one in Christ Jesus, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The prophets and Moses; </span> Moses was himself also a prophet, but he is here made especial mention of, because of his excellency above the other prophets, (unto whom God spoke face to face), as also because he was the lawgiver to the Jews, and to whom, upon all occasions, they pretended to yield obedience. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Having therefore obtained help of God,....

This he mentions in opposition to the charge against him, as that he spoke against the law of Moses, as well as against the temple, and the people of the Jews; whereas his doctrine was perfectly agreeable to the writings of Moses, and the prophets, concerning the Messiah, they speak of in many places, and the Jews expected. There is an entire harmony and agreement between the writings of Moses, and the prophets of the Old Testament, and the apostles of the New, in all the doctrines of the Gospel revelation; in the doctrine of a trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence, and of the proper deity of each person; in the doctrines respecting the person, offices, and work of Christ; that he is the Son of God, God and man in one person, and the only Mediator between God and man; and that he is prophet, priest, and King; and that the great work he was appointed to, undertook, and came about, and has fulfilled, is the redemption of his people; and in the several doctrines of grace concerning the choice of men to salvation, the covenant made with Christ on account of them, their redemption, justification, and pardon, their repentance and good works, the resurrection of the dead, and a future state: the particular things instanced in, the apostle preached, and Moses and the prophets said should be, and in which they agreed, are as follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:</span><p>(7) Christ is the end of the Law and the Prophets.<p>(f) To everyone.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-22.htm" title="Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue to this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:">Acts 26:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπικουρίας</span> … <span class="greekheb">τῆς παρὰ</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span>) <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>: “the help that is from God,” R.V., <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the help which cometh from God only; only here in N.T., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/13-18.htm" title="For health he calleth upon that which is weak: for life prayeth to that which is dead; for aid humbly beseecheth that which hath least means to help: and for a good journey he asketh of that which cannot set a foot forward:">Wis 13:18</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἐμπειρίας</span>, 2), for the use of the same phrase <span class="ital">cf.</span> instances in Wetstein from Polybius; the word is found in Josephus, but also frequently in classical Greek, of succour against foes.—<span class="greekheb">τυχὼν</span>: no idea of chance, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-10.htm" title="Therefore I endure all things for the elect's sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.">2 Timothy 2:10</a>; the aid was divine, not human.—<span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, see Wendt, and references, Blass, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 267, Winer-Moulton, liii., 10, 4.—<span class="greekheb">ἕστηκα</span>: <span class="ital">sto salvus</span>, Bengel, after these repeated dangers.
