The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>After those days - After what had occurred, as related in the previous verses.<p>We took up our carriages - This is a most unhappy translation. The word carriage we apply now exclusively to a vehicle for conveying anything as a coach, chariot, gig, cannon carriage, etc. The original word means simply that they prepared themselves; made themselves ready; put their baggage in order, etc. &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  aposkeuasamenoi. They prepared for the journey. The English word carriage was formerly used in the sense of what is carried, baggage, burden, vessels, furniture, etc. Thus, it was used in the time that our translation was made; and in this sense it is to be understood in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-22.htm">1 Samuel 17:22</a>, "And David left his carriage (baggage) in the hand of the keeper of the carriage," etc. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/21-20.htm">Acts 21:20</a>, margin; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-28.htm">Isaiah 10:28</a>, "At Michmash he hath laid up his carriages" (his baggage, etc.). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16. we took up our carriages&#8212;"our baggage."<p>and went up to Jerusalem&#8212;for the fifth time after his conversion, thus concluding his third missionary tour, which proved his last, so far as recorded; for though he accomplished the fourth and last part of the missionary plan sketched out (Ac 19:21)&#8212;"After I have been at Jerusalem, I must also see Rome"&#8212;it was as "a prisoner of Jesus Christ."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> As they do pack up that are to remove to another house or place, not intending to come thither any more again; this also did show their readiness of mind to endure and suffer all things, as loss of relations and friends, and all accommodations, for Christ. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And after those days we took up our carriages,....

El</span>. 643. 681); but then we should have to suppose, without any indication in the context, that Mnason had been temporarily resident at Caesarea precisely at that time when the lodging of the travellers in his house at Jerusalem was settled with him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Nothing further is known of <span class="ital">Mnason</span> himself. The name is Greek (Ael. <span class="ital">V. H</span>. iii. 19; Athen. vi. p. 264 C, 272 B; Lucian, <span class="ital">Philops</span>. 22), and probably he was, if not a Gentile Christian, at any rate a Hellenist. Looking to the feeling which prevailed among the Jewish Christians against Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/21-20.htm" title="And when they heard it, they glorified the Lord, and said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believe; and they are all zealous of the law:...">Acts 21:20-21</a>), it was natural and prudent that he should lodge with such a one, in order that he should enter into further relations to the church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀρχαίῳ μαθ</span>.] So much the more confidently might Paul and his companions be entrusted to him. He was a <span class="ital">Christian from of old</span> (not a <span class="greekheb">νεόφυτος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-6.htm" title="Not a novice, lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil.">1 Timothy 3:6</a>); whether he had already been a Christian from the first Pentecost, or had become so, possibly through connection with his countryman Barnabas, or in some other manner, cannot be determined.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] The erroneous reading <span class="greekheb">ἀποσκ</span>., though defended by Olshausen, would at most admit the explanation: after we had <span class="ital">conveyed away</span> our baggage (Polyb. iv. 81. 11; Diod. Sic. xiii. 91; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xiv. 16. 2), according to which the travellers, in order not to go as pilgrims to the feast at Jerusalem encumbered with much luggage, would have <span class="ital">sent</span> on their baggage <span class="ital">before</span> them. The <span class="ital">leaving behind</span> of the <span class="ital">superfluous</span> baggage at Caesarea (Wolf, Olshausen, and others), or the laying aside of things unworthy for their entrance into and residence in Jerusalem (Ewald), would be purely imported ideas.

Grotius took it as = “sarcinas jumentis imponere,” as if <span class="greekheb">ὑποζύγια</span>, Xen., <span class="ital">Hell.</span>, vii, 2, 18. Hackett and Rendall refer the word to the packing up of the valuable alms which St. Paul was carrying to Jerusalem, but this interpretation seems fanciful, although Hackett supposes that the contribution might have consisted in part of raiment or provisions. Belser still more curiously refers it to getting change in the current money of Palestine for the alms collected in the coin of various lands.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνεβ</span>.: imperfect, to denote the start on the journey (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-25.htm" title="And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.">Acts 8:25</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὑπέστρεφον</span>, R.V.).
