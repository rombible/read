It is interesting to note the revival of the old prophetic manner of predicting by symbolic acts. So Isaiah had walked “naked and barefoot” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/20-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah has walked naked and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder on Egypt and on Ethiopia;">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>); and Jeremiah had gone and left his girdle in a cave on the banks of the Euphrates, and had made bonds and yokes, and had put them on his neck (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/13-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me, Go and get you a linen girdle, and put it on your loins, and put it not in water.">Jeremiah 13:1-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to me; Make you bonds and yokes, and put them on your neck,">Jeremiah 27:2</a>); and Ezekiel had portrayed the siege of Jerusalem on a tile, and had cut the hair from his head and beard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/4-1.htm" title="You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city, even Jerusalem:">Ezekiel 4:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/5-1.htm" title="And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber's razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.">Ezekiel 5:1-4</a>). Looking to the previous relations between St. Paul and Agabus at Antioch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>), we may well believe that the latter, foreseeing the danger to which the Apostle would be exposed, came down to Cæsarea, in a spirit of friendly anxiety, to warn him not to come. The feeling which led to the murderous plot of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-12.htm" title="And when it was day, certain of the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.">Acts 23:12</a> could be no secret to a prophet living at Jerusalem.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:8-18 Paul had express warning of his troubles, that when they came, they might be no surprise or terror to him. The general notice given us, that through much tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of God, should be of the same use to us. Their weeping began to weaken and slacken his resolution Has not our Master told us to take up our cross? It was a trouble to him, that they should so earnestly press him to do that in which he could not gratify them without wronging his conscience. When we see trouble coming, it becomes us to say, not only, The will of the Lord must be done, and there is no remedy; but, Let the will of the Lord be done; for his will is his wisdom, and he doeth all according to the counsel of it. When a trouble is come, this must allay our griefs, that the will of the Lord is done; when we see it coming, this must silence our fears, that the will of the Lord shall be done; and we ought to say, Amen, let it be done. It is honourable to be an old disciple of Jesus Christ, to have been enabled by the grace of God to continue long in a course of duty, stedfast in the faith, growing more and more experienced, to a good old age. And with these old disciples one would choose to lodge; for the multitude of their years shall teach wisdom. Many brethren at Jerusalem received Paul gladly. We think, perhaps, that if we had him among us, we should gladly receive him; but we should not, if, having his doctrine, we do not gladly receive that.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He took Paul's girdle - The loose, flowing robes, or outer garments, which were worn in Eastern countries, were bound by a girdle, or sash, around the body when they ran, or labored, or walked. Such a girdle was therefore an indispensable part of dress.<p>And bound his own hands and feet - As emblematic of what would be done by the Jews to Paul. It was common for the prophets to perform actions which were emblematic of the events which they predicted. The design was to make the prediction more forcible and impressive by representing it to the eye. Thus, Jeremiah was directed to bury his girdle by the Euphrates, to denote the approaching captivity of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-4.htm">Jeremiah 13:4</a>. Thus, he was directed to make bands and yokes, and to put them around his neck, as a sign to Edom and Moab, etc., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-2.htm">Jeremiah 27:2-3</a>. Thus, the act of the potter was emblematic of the destruction that was coming upon the nation of the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-4.htm">Jeremiah 18:4</a>. So Isaiah walked naked and barefoot as a sign of the captivity of Egypt and Ethiopia, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-3.htm">Isaiah 20:3-4</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, etc.<p>So shall the Jews ... - This was fulfilled.

So shall the Jews bind the man that owneth this girdle, &c.&#8212;For though the Romans did it, it was at the Jews' instigation (Ac 21:33; Ac 28:17). Such dramatic methods of announcing important future events would bring the old prophets to remembrance. (Compare Isa 20:2, &c.; Jer 13:1, and Eze 5:1, &c.). This prediction and that at Tyre (Ac 21:4) were intended, not to prohibit him from going, but to put his courage to the test and when he stood the test, to deepen and mature it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Took Paul’s girdle; </span> it was ordinary amongst the prophets to confirm, or at least to exemplify, their prophecies by outward signs and symbols, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm" title="At the same time spoke the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz, saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off your loins, and put off your shoe from your foot.
