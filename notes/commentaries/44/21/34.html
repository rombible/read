They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into the castle - The castle of Antonia, where the guard was kept.

There was a passage out of it, into the north and west cloisters of the mountain of the house, and by that the Roman garrison soldiers went down at every festival of the Jews, to take care against tumults and seditions, in those great concourses of the people.'' <p>And it was by this passage that the chief captain, with the centurions and soldiers, came down so quickly and suddenly upon the Jews, while they were beating Paul in the temple; and this castle being on such an eminence as described, hence he with the soldiers is said to run down, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-32.htm">Acts 21:32</a> And it was in this way that the apostle was led up to the castle. <p>(e) Antiqu. l. 15. c. 11. sect. 4.

The main tower had a smaller tower at each corner, the one at the southeastern corner being the largest and overlooking the temple. In this tower were the quarters of the soldiers.

Hence the noun means, a body drawn up in battle-array, and passes thence into the meaning of an encampment, soldiers' quarters, barracks. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-34.htm">Hebrews 11:34</a>, it occurs in the earlier sense of an army; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-11.htm">Hebrews 13:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-13.htm">Hebrews 13:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-9.htm">Revelation 20:9</a>, in the sense of an encampment.
