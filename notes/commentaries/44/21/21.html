How far was it a true representation of its tendencies? As a personal accusation it was, of course, easy to refute it. His rule of adaptation led him to be to the Jews as a Jew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-20.htm" title="And to the Jews I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews; to them that are under the law, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under the law;">1Corinthians 9:20</a>). He taught that every man, circumcised or uncircumcised, should accept his position with its attendant obligations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-18.htm" title="Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised. Is any called in uncircumcision? let him not be circumcised.">1Corinthians 7:18-20</a>). He had himself taken the Nazarite vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>), and had circumcised Timotheus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). It was probably false that he had ever taught that Jews “ought not to circumcise their children.” But fanaticism is sometimes clear-sighted in its bitterness, and the Judaisers felt that when it was proclaimed that “circumcision was nothing,” in its bearing on man’s relations to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-19.htm" title="Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.">1Corinthians 7:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>), it ceased to have a <span class= "ital">raison d’être, </span>and sank to the level of a mere badge of the national exclusiveness, which, in its turn, was assailed by St. Paul’s teaching that all middle walls of partition were broken down (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), and that Jews and Gentiles were alike one in Christ. If a Jew had asked, Why then should I circumcise my child? it would not have been easy to return a satisfying answer. If it were said, “To avoid giving offence,” that was clearly only temporary and local in its application, and the practice would die out as people ceased to be offended. If it were urged that it was a divine command, there was the reply that, as a command, it had been virtually though not formally repealed when the promises and privileges connected with it were withdrawn. It was the seal of a covenant (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a>), and could hardly be looked upon as binding when the covenant itself had been superseded. Few Christians would now hold that a converted Jew was still bound to circumcise, as well as baptise, his children. The writer of the Epistle to the Hebrews did but push St. Paul’s teaching to its legitimate conclusions when he said that the “new covenant had made the first old,” and that “that which is decaying and waxing old is ready to vanish away” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That thou teachest all the Jews . . . to forsake Moses.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">that thou teachest apostasy from Moses, </span>the term used, with all its burden of evil import, adding weight to the charge.<p><span class= "bld">Neither to walk after the customs.</span>—On the general import of this phrase, as including the “traditions of the elders,” as well as the precepts of the Law, see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:19-26 Paul ascribed all his success to God, and to God they gave the praise. God had honoured him more than any of the apostles, yet they did not envy him; but on the contrary, glorified the Lord. They could not do more to encourage Paul to go on cheerfully in his work. James and the elders of the church at Jerusalem, asked Paul to gratify the believing Jews, by some compliance with the ceremonial law. They thought it was prudent in him to conform thus far. It was great weakness to be so fond of the shadows, when the substance was come. The religion Paul preached, tended not to destroy the law, but to fulfil it. He preached Christ, the end of the law for righteousness, and repentance and faith, in which we are to make great use of the law. The weakness and evil of the human heart strongly appear, when we consider how many, even of the disciples of Christ, had not due regard to the most eminent minister that even lived. Not the excellence of his character, nor the success with which God blessed his labours, could gain their esteem and affection, seeing that he did not render the same respect as themselves to mere ceremonial observances. How watchful should we be against prejudices! The apostles were not free from blame in all they did; and it would be hard to defend Paul from the charge of giving way too much in this matter. It is vain to attempt to court the favour of zealots, or bigots to a party. This compliance of Paul did not answer, for the very thing by which he hoped to pacify the Jews, provoked them, and brought him into trouble. But the all-wise God overruled both their advice and Paul's compliance with it, to serve a better purpose than was intended. It was in vain to think of pleasing men who would be pleased with nothing but the rooting out of Christianity. Integrity and uprightness will be more likely to preserve us than insincere compliances. And it should warn us not to press men to doing what is contrary to their own judgment to oblige us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they are informed of thee - Reports respecting the conduct of Paul would be likely to be in circulation among all at Jerusalem. His remarkable conversion, his distinguished zeal, his success among the Gentiles, would make his conduct a subject of special interest. Evil-minded men among the Jews, who came up to Jerusalem from different places where he had been, would be likely to represent him as the decided enemy of the laws of Moses, and these reports would be likely to reach the ears of the Jewish converts. The reports, as they gained ground, would be greatly magnified, until suspicion might be excited among the Christians at Jerusalem that he was, as he was reputed to be, the settled foe of the Jewish rites and customs.<p>That thou teachest all the Jews ... - From all the evidence which we have of his conduct, this report was incorrect and slanderous. The truth appears to have been, that he did not enjoin the observance of those laws on the Gentile converts; that the effect of his ministry on them was to lead them to suppose that their observance was not necessary - contrary to the doctrines of the Judaizing teachers (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15.htm">Acts 15</a>); and that he argued with the Jews themselves, where it could be done, against the obligation of those laws and customs since the Messiah had come. The Jews depended on their observance for justification and salvation. This Paul strenuously opposed; and this view he defended at length in the Epistles which he wrote. See the Epistles to the Romans, the Galatians, and the Hebrews. Yet these facts might be easily misunderstood and perverted, so as to give rise to the slanderous report that he was the enemy of Moses and the Law.<p>Which are among the Gentiles - Who live in pagan countries. The Jews were extensively scattered and settled in all the large towns and cities of the Roman empire.<p>To forsake Moses - The Law and the authority of Moses. That is, to regard his laws as no longer binding.<p>To walk after the customs - To observe the institutions of the Mosaic ritual. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>. The word "customs" denotes "the rites of the Mosaic economy the offering of sacrifices, incense, the oblations, anointings, festivals, etc., which the Law of Moses prescribed." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. they are informed &#8230; that thou teachest all the Jews which are among the Gentiles&#8212;those residing in heathen countries.<p>to forsake Moses, &c.&#8212;This calumny of the unbelieving Jews would find easy credence among the Christian zealots for Judaism.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Informed of thee; </span> instructed or catechised concerning thee; the zealots had made it their business to instil such aspersions and odious reflections against Paul, as if their accusations had been the fundamental truths of their religion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Moses; </span> the ceremonial law, given by his ministry. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To walk, </span> to live, to act in their course of life, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">after the customs</span> of their fathers, or the rituals of Moses. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they are informed of thee,....

They had taught the lesson persistently till their hearers were fully trained in it. We can hence understand the great hostility which the Apostle experienced, and his strong language about these Judaizers.
