They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Jew of Tarsus - A Jew by birth.<p>Of no mean city - Not obscure, or undistinguished.

And not that Egyptian; he was not of that country, much less that man; but a Jew, both by birth and religion; he was born of Jewish parents, and brought up in the Jewish religion; though his native place was Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, where it is placed by Pliny (n), Ptolomy (o), and Mela (p); and is by some thought to be the same with the Tarshish of the Old Testament: <p>a citizen of no mean city; Pliny (q) calls it a free city, and Solinus (r) says it is the mother, or chief of cities, and Curtius (s) speaks of it as a very opulent one; which when Alexander drew near to with his army, the inhabitants of it set fire to, that he might not possess their riches; which he understanding, sent Parmenio to prevent it: through this city, as the same historian, in agreement with Pliny and others, observes, ran the river Cydnus; and it being summer time when Alexander was here, and very hot weather, and being covered with dust and sweat, he put off his clothes, and cast himself into the river to wash himself; but as soon as he was in, he was seized with such a numbness of his nerves, that had he not been immediately taken out by his soldiers, and for the extraordinary care of his physician, he had at once expired. Josephus (t) calls this city the most famous of the cities in Gallicia; and derives it, and the whole country, from Tarshish, the grandson of Japheth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-4.htm">Genesis 10:4</a> his words are, <p>"Tharsus gave name to the Tharsians, for so Cilicia was formerly called, of which this is an evidence; for the most famous of the cities with them, and which is the metropolis, is called Tarsus; Theta being changed into Tau for appellation sake.'' <p>Though some say it was built by Perseus, the son of Jupiter and Danae, and called Tharsus, of the hyacinth stone, which is said to be found about it: others think it was so called,  , because the places of this country were first dried up after the flood: it was not only a city of stately buildings, as it was repaired by Sardanapalus, and increased after the times of Alexander; but there was a famous academy in it, which, for men of learning, exceeded Athens and Alexandria (u); though these exceeded that in number of philosophers: here it is thought lived Aratus the poet, from whom the apostle cites a passage, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-28.htm">Acts 17:28</a> and of this place was the famous Chrysippus, who is called  "a Tarsian" (w), as the apostle is here. Hermogenes, a very celebrated rhetorician, some of whose works are still extant, came from hence (x). Jerom (y) reports it as a tradition, that the parents of the Apostle Paul were of Giscalis, a town in Judea; which with the whole province being destroyed by the Romans, they removed to Tarsus, a city of Cilicia, whither Paul when a young man followed them; but certain it is, that the apostle was born there, as he himself says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>. Ignatius, in (z) the "second" century, writing to the church at Tarsus, calls them citizens and disciples of Paul; citizens, because he was of this city; and disciples, because of the same faith with him; and very likely the first materials of the church in this place were converts of his; since it is evident that he went hither after he was a preacher; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>. <p>And I beseech thee suffer me to speak unto the people; first he desired to speak with the captain, and that was in order to obtain leave to speak to the people; and which he asks in a very handsome and submissive manner, and hopes to have his request granted him, since he was not the person he took him for, but was a Jew by birth, and a citizen of a very considerable Roman city; and was not a mean, sordid, vagabond creature, nor need he fear that he would sow any discord and sedition among the people. <p>(n) Nat.

Hobart (so too Zahn) mentions <span class="greekheb">ἄσημος</span> as one of the words which show that Luke, when dealing with unprofessional subjects, shows a leaning to the use of professional language; <span class="greekheb">ἄσημος</span> is the technical term for “a disease without distinctive symptoms,” and Hippocrates, just as Luke, says, <span class="greekheb">μία πόλεων οὐκ ἄσημος</span>, <span class="ital">Epis.</span>, 1273. So again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-13.htm" title="And they were more than forty which had made this conspiracy.">Acts 23:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἀναδιδόναι</span>, a word applied to the distribution of nourishment throughout the body, or of blood throughout the veins, is used by Hippocrates, as by Luke, <span class="ital">l.c.</span>, of a messenger delivering a letter, <span class="ital">Epis.</span>, 1275 (see Hobart and Zahn); but it must be admitted that the same phrase is found in Polybius and Plutarch. Still the fact remains that the phraseology of St. Luke is here illustrated by a use of two similar expressions in Hippocrates, and it should be also remembered that the verb with which St. Luke opens his Gospel, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιχειρεῖν</span>, was frequently used by medical men, and that too in its secondary sense, just as by St. Luke, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Hippocrates begins his treatise <span class="ital">De Prisca Med.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὁκόσοι ἐπειχείρησαν περὶ ἰατρικῆς λέγειν ἢ γράφειν</span> (see J. Weiss on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-1.htm" title="For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,">Luke 1:1</a>); so too Galen uses the word similarly, although it must be admitted that the same use is found in classical Greek and in Josephus, c. <span class="ital">Apion.</span>, 2<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[363] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39</span>. <span class="ital">But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus</span>] The A.

But we have only to remember that the Apostle and his interlocutor were high up above the crowd, and so away from the noise; that the staircase crowded with soldiers, who could not rapidly be withdrawn because they were restraining the multitude, made some delay absolutely unavoidable, and that, added to this was the surprise of the chief captain that his prisoner could speak Greek, and we have enough warrant for accepting the story as it is here told. Moreover the Greek which the Apostle used was of a very polished character, shewing the education and refinement of the speaker, and making good his claim to respect.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-39.htm" title="But Paul said, I am a man which am a Jew of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech you, suffer me to speak to the people.">Acts 21:39</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μὲν</span>) <span class="greekheb">Μὲν</span> imparts <span class="greekheb">ἦθος</span> to the beginning of a speech: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm" title="I am truly a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as you all are this day.">Acts 22:3</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ μέν εἰμι ἀνήρ</span>.—[<span class="greekheb">λαλῆσαι</span>, <span class="ital">to speak</span>) With what great prudence did the apostle forthwith avail himself of the opportunity afforded by circumstances!
