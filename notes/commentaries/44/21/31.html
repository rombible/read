On the word for “chief captain” (literally, <span class= "ital">chiliarch, </span>or “captain of a thousand men,” the cohort being the sixth part of the legion, which consisted of 6, 000), see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm" title="And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?">Matthew 8:29</a>. They were stationed in the tower known as Antonia, built by Herod the Great, and named in honour of the Triumvir, which stood on the north-west side of the Temple area, on a rock, with a turret at each corner, and two flights of stairs leading to the arcades on the northern and western sides of the Temple. The Roman garrison was obviously stationed there to command the crowds of pilgrims, and was likely to be on the alert at a time like the Pentecost Feast. The Procurator Felix, however, was for the time at Cæsarea. The next verse shows that their appearance was sufficient at once to strike some kind of awe into the turbulent mob. Once again the Apostle owed his safety from violence to the interposition of the civil power, (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:">Acts 18:14-17</a>.)

A cohort, or detachment of soldiers, belonging to the Roman legion which lodged in the adjacent castle of Antonia, were stationed on feast days near the temple, to prevent disorders. It is evident Lysias himself was not present when the tumult began. Probably he was the oldest Roman tribune then at Jerusalem, and, as such, was the commanding officer of the legion quartered at the castle. <span class="ital">Who immediately took soldiers, </span>&c. — And ran down unto them, namely, to suppress the riot, knowing how much it was his concern to check such proceedings. <span class="ital">And when they saw the chief captain </span>and <span class="ital">soldiers, they left beating of Paul </span>— Which it appears they had begun to do in such a manner, that, had he not been thus seasonably rescued in this critical moment, his life must soon have fallen a sacrifice to their rage. <span class="ital">Then the chief captain — </span>Having made his way through the multitude, <span class="ital">came near and took him </span>— Into his custody. And how many great ends of Providence were answered by this imprisonment! It was not only a means of preserving his life, (after he had suffered severely for worldly prudence,) but it gave him an opportunity of preaching the gospel safely, in spite of all tumult, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-22.htm" title="And they gave him audience to this word, and then lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he should live.">Acts 22:22</a>; yea, and that in those places to which otherwise he could have had no access, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-40.htm" title="And when he had given him license, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand to the people.

They falsely charged him with ill doctrine and ill practice against the Mosaic ceremonies. It is no new thing for those who mean honestly and act regularly, to have things laid to their charge which they know not and never thought of. It is common for the wise and good to have that charged against them by malicious people, with which they thought to have obliged them. God often makes those a protection to his people, who have no affection to them, but only have compassion for sufferers, and regard to the public peace. And here see what false, mistaken notions of good people and good ministers, many run away with. But God seasonably interposes for the safety of his servants, from wicked and unreasonable men; and gives them opportunities to speak for themselves, to plead for the Redeemer, and to spread abroad his glorious gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as they went about to kill him - Greek: they seeking to kill him.

This was built by John Hyrcanus, high priest of the Jews, and was by him called Baris. It was beautified and strengthened by Herod the Great, and was called Antonia in honor of his friend, Mark Antony. Josephus describes this castle as consisting of four towers, one of which overlooked the temple, and which he says was 70 cubits high (Jewish Wars, book 5, chapter 5, section 8). In this castle a guard of Roman soldiers was stationed to secure the temple and to maintain the peace. The commander of this cohort is here called "the chief captain." Reference is made to this guard several times in the New Testament, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-65.htm">Matthew 27:65-66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-12.htm">John 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-26.htm">Acts 5:26</a>. The word translated "chief captain" denotes properly "one who commanded 1,000 men." The band &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;  speira was the tenth part of a legion, and consisted sometimes of four hundred and twenty-five soldiers, at others of five hundred, and at others of six hundred, according to the size of the legion.
