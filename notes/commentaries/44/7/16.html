If we limit the verb to the patriarchs, which is in itself a tenable limitation, we are met by the fresh difficulty that the Old Testament contains no record of the burial of any of the Twelve Patriarchs, with the exception of Joseph, whose bones were laid, on the occupation of Canaan, in Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>); and Josephus states (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> iv. 8, § 2) that they were buried at Hebron. This, however, only represents, at the best, a local tradition. In the time of Jerome (<span class= "ital">Ep.</span> 86) the tombs of the Twelve Patriarchs were shown at Shechem, and this in its turn witnesses to a Samaritan tradition which continues to the present day (<span class= "ital">Palestine Exploration Report, </span>Dec., 1877), and which Stephen, it may be, followed in preference to that of Judæa. Looking to the probabilities of the case, it was likely that the example set by Joseph would be followed by the other tribes, and that as Shechem was far more prominent than Hebron, as the centre of the civil and religious life of Israel in the time of Joshua, that should have been chosen as the burial-place of his brethren rather than Machpelah. Looking, again, to the fact that one of Stephen’s companions, immediately after his death, goes to Samaria as a preacher, and that there are good grounds for believing that both had been previously connected with it (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-5.htm" title="And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:">Acts 6:5</a>), we may probably trace to this influence his adoption of the Samaritan version of the history. The hated Sychar (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-26.htm" title="If thou desire wisdom, keep the commandments, and the Lord shall give her unto thee.">Ecclesiasticus 1:26</a>; see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm" title="Then comes he to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.">John 4:5</a>) had, from Stephen’s point of view, a claim on the reverence of all true Israelites, and his assertion of that claim may well have been one of the causes of the bitterness with which his hearers listened to him.<p><span class= "bld">That Abraham bought for a sum of money.</span>—Here we seem to come across a direct contradiction to the narrative of Genesis. The only recorded transaction in which Abraham appears as a buyer, was his purchase of the cave of Machpelah from Ephron the Hittite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm" title="And Abraham listened to Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant.">Genesis 23:16</a>). The only recorded transaction in which the sons of Emmor, or Hamor, appear as sellers, was in Jacob’s purchase of the field at Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>). What we have seen above, however, prepares us for there having been a Samaritan tradition carrying the associations of Shechem to a remoter past. And, assuming such a tradition, there are significant facts in the patriarchal history of which it furnishes an explanation. (1) Jacob gives as a special inheritance to Joseph, “one portion” (in the Hebrew, “one <span class= "ital">Shechem;</span>” in the LXX., <span class= "ital">Sikima</span>) above his brethren, which he had taken “out of the hands of the Amorites with his sword and his bow.” Of that conquest—as it is clear that the words cannot refer to the massacre connected with the story of Dinah, which Jacob had severely condemned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm" title="And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, You have troubled me to make me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and I shall be destroyed, I and my house.">Genesis 34:30</a>)—the history contains no record, and to interpret the words as prophetic of future conquests is to strain them to a non-natural interpretation which they will hardly bear. Jacob did not come as an invader, nor had the time for thus taking possession of the whole land as yet arrived. The facts of the case suggest a special right claimed and asserted in regard to this one possession, and that right presupposes a previous purchase by some ancestor of Jacob’s—<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>by Abraham. This being done and the right asserted, to make the portion larger, and perhaps as a measure of conciliation, there followed the subsequent purchase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>. (2) Shechem was the earliest settlement of Abraham on his entrance into Canaan, and there he built an altar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-7.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to Abram, and said, To your seed will I give this land: and there built he an altar to the LORD, who appeared to him.">Genesis 12:7</a>). But the feeling of reverence for holy places, always strong in the Hebrew race, as seen, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the case of David and Araunah, would hardly permit a man of Abraham’s wealth and princely nobleness to offer burnt-offerings to the Lord of that which had cost him nothing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.">2Samuel 24:24</a>); nor would a devout worshipper be content to see the altar so consecrated in the possession of another, and so exposed to desecration. The building of an altar involved, almost of necessity, as in the case just cited, the purchase of the ground on which it stood. (3) The Samaritans had an immemorial tradition (adopted by Dean Stanley, Ffouikes, Grove, and others) that the sacrifice of Isaac took place on the mountain of Moriah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a>), or Gerizim, which commands the plain of Moreh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6</a>), or Shechem; and, without now discussing the evidence for or against the tradition, it almost involved of necessity the assumption that Abraham had already an altar there, and with it a consecrated field which he could call his own. (4) Another Samaritan tradition, it may be noted, connected Shechem with the sacrifice offered by Melchizedek. This is enough to show the extent of the claims which were made by the Samaritans on behalf of their sacred places, and, taken together with the statement referred to in the previous Note as to the tombs of the Patriarchs, leads us <span class= "ital">to t</span>he conclusion that Stephen, more or less influenced by his recent associations with them, adopted their traditions. This seems, at any rate, the most probable solution of the difficulty which the statement at first sight presents. To do this in Jerusalem, before the very Sanhedrin, the members of which had reviled our Lord as a Samaritan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm" title="Then answered the Jews, and said to him, Say we not well that you are a Samaritan, and have a devil?">John 8:48</a>), required a martyr’s boldness, and, claiming as it did, a brotherhood for the hated Samaritans, the hereditary foes of Judah, had, we may believe, much to do with causing the fury that ended in his actual martyrdom. It may be added (1) that the manifest familiarity of St. Luke with Samaria and the Samaritans would dispose him to accept such a tradition without correction (see <span class= "ital">Introduction to St. Luke’s Gospel</span>)<span class= "ital">;</span> (2) that the Twelve, some of whom had sojourned for three days at Sychar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-43.htm" title="Now after two days he departed there, and went into Galilee.">John 4:43</a>), were likely to have become acquainted with it, and to have been ignorant of the Hebron traditions; (3) that the well-known substitution of Gerizim for Ebal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-4.htm" title="Therefore it shall be when you be gone over Jordan, that you shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in mount Ebal, and you shall plaster them with plaster.">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>, in the Samaritan Pentateuch, not less than their addition of a commandment to build an altar on Gerizim to the ten great laws of Exodus 20, shows a tendency to deal freely with the text and the facts of the Pentateuch, so as to support their own traditions as to their sacred places.<p><span class= "bld">Of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.</span>—The insertion of the word “father” instead of “son,” which would be (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-3.htm" title="Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican; James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was Thaddaeus;">Matthew 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>) the natural rendering of the Greek construction, must be looked on as betraying a wish on the part of the translators to meet the difficulty presented by the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-2.htm" title="And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled her.">Genesis 34:2</a>, that Shechem was the <span class= "ital">son</span> of Hamor the Hivite. It may be noted that it is the only English version that thus tampers with the text—Tyndale giving “at Sychem;” Wiclif, Cranmer, Geneva, and the Rhemish giving “<span class= "ital">son</span> of Sychem.” A possible explanation of the apparent discrepancy may be found in the very probable assumption that Shechem may have been a quasi-hereditary name appearing in alternate generations. In this instance, however, textual criticism comes in to cut the knot. Many of the better MSS., including the Vatican and the Sinaitic, give the reading “in Sychem,” and so make the name apply to the place and not to a person.<p>With the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>, we have now come to the last of the difficulties, chronological, historical, or numerical, presented by St. Stephen’s speech. They have been approached by writers of different schools of thought in ways singularly, sometimes almost painfully, characteristic. On the one hand, there has been something like the eagerness of a partisan mustering all objections and anxious to secure an adverse verdict; on the other, there has been an almost hysterical alarm and indignation that such questions should be ever raised. Here the effort has, at least, been made to deal with each on its own merits, and not to force facts this way or that to meet a foregone conclusion. Should there be errors of transcription, of report, or even of memory in the record of St. Stephen’s speech, they need not shake the faith of those who have learnt to take a higher view of inspiration than that which depends upon the registers of genealogies or chronological tables. But it may be well also not to assume too hastily that men of average culture and information would be altogether ignorant of the facts which they narrate, and the sacred writings which have been the object of their continual study. And it may be urged that the appearance of seeming inaccuracies, which a moment’s reference to the Book of Genesis would have enabled the writer to correct, is, at any rate, evidence of faithfulness in his report of the speech which he thus reproduces.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-16 Stephen was charged as a blasphemer of God, and an apostate from the church; therefore he shows that he is a son of Abraham, and values himself on it. The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And died - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-33.htm">Genesis 49:33</a>.<p>He and our fathers - The time which the Israelites remained in Egypt was 215 years, so that all the sons of Jacob were deceased before the Jews went out to go to the land of Canaan.<p>And were carried over - Jacob himself was buried in the field of Macpelah by Joseph and his brethren, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>, 13. It is expressly said that the bones of Joseph were carried by the Israelites when they went into the land of Canaan, and buried in Shechem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>. No mention is made in the Old Testament of their carrying the bones of any of the other patriarchs, but the thing is highly probable in itself. If the descendants of Joseph carried his bones, it would naturally occur to them to take also the bones of each of the patriarchs, and give them an honorable sepulchre together in the land of promise. Josephus (Antiq., book 2, chapter 8, section 2) says that "the posterity and sons of these men (of the brethren of Joseph), after some time, carried their bodies and buried them in Hebron; but as to the bones of Joseph, they carried them into the land of Canaan afterward, when the Hebrews went out of Egypt." This is in accordance with the common opinion of the Jewish writers, that they were buried in Hebron. Yet the tradition is not uniform. Some of the Jews affirm that they were buried in Sychem (Kuinoel). As the Scriptures do not anywhere deny that the patriarchs were buried in Sychem, it cannot be proved that Stephen was in error. There is one circumstance of strong probability to show that he was correct. At the time when this defense was delivered, "Sychem" was in the hands of the Samaritans, between whom and the Jews there was a violent hostility. Of course, the Jews would not be willing to concede that the Samaritans had the bones of their ancestors, and hence, perhaps the opinion had been maintained that they were buried in Hebron.<p>Into Sychem - This was a town or village near to Samaria. It was called Sichar (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-5.htm">John 4:5</a>), "Shechem," and "Sychem." It is now called "Naplous" or "Napolose," and is ten miles from Shiloh, and about forty from Jerusalem, toward the north.<p>That Abraham bought - The word "Abraham" here has given rise to considerable perplexity, and it is now pretty generally conceded that it is a mistake. It is certain, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>, that this piece of land was bought, not by Abraham, but by "Jacob," of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem. The land which "Abraham" purchased was the cave of Macpelah, of the sons of Heth, in Hebron, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/23.htm">Genesis 23</a>. Various solutions have been proposed of this difficulty, which it is not necessary to detail. It may be remarked, however:<p>(1) That as the text now stands, it is an evident error. This is clear from the passages cited from the Old Testament above.<p>(2) it is not at all probable that either Stephen or Luke would have committed such an error. Every consideration must lead us to the conclusion that they were too well acquainted with such prominent points of the Jewish history to commit an error like this.<p>(3) the "probability," therefore, is, that the error has arisen since; but how, is not known, nor is there any way of ascertaining. All the ancient versions agree in reading "Abraham." Only one manuscript reads "Abraham our father." Some have supposed, therefore, that it was written "which our father bought," and that some early transcriber inserted the name of Abraham. Others, that the name was omitted entirely by Stephen; and then the antecedent to the verb "bought" will be "Jacob," in verse 15, according with the fact. Other modes have been proposed also, but none are entirely satisfactory. If there was positive proof of Stephen's inspiration, or if it were necessary to make that out, the difficulty would be much greater. But it has already been remarked that there is no decisive evidence of that, and it is not necessary to make out that point to defend the Scriptures. All that can be demanded of the historian is, that he should give a fair account of the defense as it was delivered; and though the probability is that Stephen would not commit Such an error, yet, admitting that he did, it by no means proves that "Luke" was not inspired, or that Luke has committed any error in recording "what was actually said."<p>Of the sons of Emmor - In the Hebrew Gen 33:19, "the children of Hamor" - but different ways of rendering the same word. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. threescore and fifteen souls&#8212;according to the Septuagint version of Ge 46:27, which Stephen follows, including the five children and grandchildren of Joseph's two sons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> That they carried Joseph to bury him in Canaan, according to the oath he made them take, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-25.htm" title="And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle after their kind, and every thing that creeps on the earth after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:25</a></span>, is certain; and that this was desired to be done for him out of faith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-22.htm" title="By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his bones.">Hebrews 11:22</a></span>; but is not so certain (unless this place be so understood) that the rest of the patriarchs were so translated after their death: yet it is very likely; for, first: They had as much reason to desire it as Joseph had; they believed the same promises, and had an interest in that land as well as he. Secondly: Their posterity bore the same respect unto them that Joseph’s family did to him. Thirdly: It seems alike reasonable, that none of those twelve heirs to the land of Canaan should be left in the land of bondage. This place is acknowledged to be most difficult, and the difficulties are better not to be mentioned than ill solved, which the nature of these notes (not to mention other reasons) might occasion: whosoever will consider the intended shortness of the story, with the usual idioms of the Hebrew language, from which it was deduced, may take this as a paraphrase upon the whole verse: And Jacob and our fathers died, and were removed to Sychem, and were laid in sepulchres, in that which Abraham bought for money, and in that which was bought of the sons of Emmor, the father of Sychem. <span class="ital">Dr. Lightfoot, in locum.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And were carried over into Sichem,.... The Syriac version reads in the singular number, "and he was translated into Sichem, and laid", &amp;c. as if this was said of Jacob only, whereas he is not spoken of at all, only the fathers, the twelve patriarchs; for Jacob, though he was carried out of Egypt, he was not buried in Sichem, but in the cave of Machpelah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm">Genesis 50:13</a>. But Joseph and the rest of the patriarchs, who died in Egypt, when the children of Israel came out from thence, they brought their bones along with them, and buried them in Sichem: of the burial of Joseph there, there is no doubt, since it is expressly affirmed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a> and that the rest of the patriarchs were buried there, and not in Hebron, as Josephus asserts (x), may be concluded from hence; because in the cave of Machpelah at Hebron, there are never mentioned more in Jewish writers (y), than these four couple; Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah; from whence, they say, Hebron was called Kirjath Arba, the city of four; as also, because it is the general consent of the Jews; and if they had not agreed in it, or said nothing about it, the thing is natural to suppose, that the children of Israel brought the bones of all the patriarchs out of Egypt, along with Joseph's (z); and since they buried the bones of Joseph in Sichem, it is most reasonable to believe, that the rest were buried there likewise; though it must be owned, that there is an entire silence about them, even when the sepulchre of Joseph is taken notice of: so R. Benjamin speaking of the Samaritans says (a), <p>"among them is the sepulchre of Joseph the righteous, the son of Jacob our father, on whom be peace, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>.'' <p>And says another of their writers (b), <p>"from Sichem about a sabbath day's journey, in a village, called Belata, there Joseph the just was buried;'' <p>but of the rest, no mention is made: <p>and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor, the father of Sichem; the last clause, the father "of Sichem", is left out in the Syriac version; and the Alexandrian copy reads it, "in Sichem"; as if it was the name of a place, and not of a man: the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "the son of Sichem"; whereas it is certain, that Sichem was the son of Emmor, or Hamor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a> unless it can be thought there were two Sichems, one that was the father of Emmor, and another that was his son: but the great difficulty is, how the sepulchre in which the fathers were laid at Sichem, can be said to be bought by Abraham of the sons of Emmor, when what Abraham bought was the field and cave of Machpelah; and that not of the sons of Emmor, but of the sons of Heth, and of Ephron, the son of Zohar the Hitrite, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-16.htm">Genesis 23:16</a>. Whereas the parcel of ground in Sichem, bought of the sons of Emmor, the father of Sichem, was bought by Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>. Various things are suggested, to reconcile this; some think the word Abraham is an interpolation, and that it should be read, which he (Jacob) bought; but to support this, no copy can be produced: others observe, that it may be read, which he bought for Abraham; that is, which Jacob bought for Abraham and his seed, as a pledge of the inheritance of the whole land, promised unto him; others think that by Abraham is meant a son of Abraham, that is, Jacob; as children are sometimes called by their father's name; as the Messiah is called David, and the like; but what best seems to remove the difficulty is, that the words refer to both places and purchases; to the field of Machpelah bought by Abraham, and to the parcel of field is Sichem bought by Jacob, of the sons of Emmor; for the words with the repetition of the phrase, "in the sepulchre", may be read thus; "and were laid in the sepulchre, that Abraham bought for a sum of money", and in the sepulchre (bought by Jacob) "of the sons of Emmor", the father of Sichem; or the words may be rendered thus, "they were carried over into Sichem, and laid in the sepulchre which Abraham bought for a sum of money, besides" that "of the sons of Emmor", the father "of Sichem"; namely, which Jacob bought, and in which Joseph was laid, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>. And this agrees with Stephen's account and design, in the preceding verse; he observes, that Jacob died in Egypt, and all the twelve patriarchs; and here he tells us how they were disposed of, and where they were buried, both Jacob and his sons; they were removed from Egypt, and brought into the land of Canaan; Jacob, he was laid in the cave of Machpelah, in the sepulchre Abraham bought of the children of Heth; and Joseph and his brethren, they were laid in the sepulchre at Sichem, which Jacob bought of the sons of Emmor: upon the whole, the charge of several errors brought by the (c) Jew against Stephen appears to be groundless; the sum this sepulchre was bought for was an hundred pieces of money, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>. <p>(x) Antiqu. l. 2. c. 8. sect. 2.((y) T.

Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> ii. 8. 7), according to which Jacob was buried in the cave of Machpelah <span class="ital">at Hebron</span> (Genesis 23), is at variance with the statement <span class="greekheb">μετετέθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς Συχέμ</span>. But Stephen—from whose memory in the hurry of an extemporary speech <span class="ital">this</span> statement escaped, and not <span class="ital">the</span> statement, that Joseph’s body was buried at Sychem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-33.htm" title="And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.">Joshua 24:33</a>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm" title="And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.">Genesis 50:25</a>)—transfers the locality of the burial of Joseph not merely to his brethren (of whose burial-place the O. T. gives no information), but also to Jacob himself, in unconscious deviation, as respects the latter, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-30.htm" title="In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial plot.">Genesis 49:30</a>. Perhaps the Rabbinical tradition, that all the brethren of Joseph were also buried at Sychem (Lightf. and Wetst. <span class="ital">in loc.</span>) was even then current, and thus more easily suggested to Stephen the error with respect to Jacob. It is, however, certain that Stephen has <span class="ital">not</span> followed an account deviating from this (Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> ii. 8. 2), which transfers the burial of all the patriarchs to <span class="ital">Hebron</span>, although no special motive can be pointed out in the matter; and it is entirely arbitrary, with Kuinoel, to assume that he had wished thereby to convey the idea that the Samaritans, to whom, in his time, <span class="ital">Sychem</span> belonged, could not, as the possessors of the graves of the patriarchs, have been rejected by God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ᾧ ὠνήσατο Ἀβρ</span>.] <span class="ital">which</span> (formerly) <span class="ital">Abraham bought</span>.

On the other hand, <span class="ital">Abraham</span> purchased from Ephron the field and burial-cave at Hebron (Genesis 23). Consequently, Stephen has here evidently fallen into a <span class="ital">mistake</span>, and asserted of Abraham what historically applied to Jacob, being led into error by the fact that something similar was recorded of Abraham. If expositors had candidly admitted the mistake so easily possible in the hurry of the moment, they would have been relieved from all strange and forced expedients of an exegetical and critical nature, and would neither have assumed a purchase not mentioned at all in the O. T., nor (Flacius, Bengel, comp. Luger) a combining of two purchases (Genesis 23, 33) and two burials (Genesis 50; Joshua 24); nor (Beza, Bochart, Bauer in <span class="ital">Philol. Thuc.

This is there spoken of as the general burial-place of the family; there were buried Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob’s wife Leah. And of Jacob we read (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm" title="And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money.">Genesis 33:19</a>), “he bought a parcel of a field where he had spread his tent, at the Hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem’s father.” We are not told that this was for a burial-place, and it is rather to be judged that it was not so, because it is added “he erected there an altar.” Moreover it is in Machpelah that Jacob desires to be buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-30.htm" title="But I will lie with my fathers, and you shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burial plot. And he said, I will do as you have said.">Genesis 47:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-30.htm" title="In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a burial plot.">Genesis 49:30</a>) and is buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm" title="For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.">Genesis 50:13</a>). We have seen (note on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-5.htm" title="My father made me swear, saying, See, I die: in my grave which I have dig for me in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father, and I will come again.">Genesis 50:5</a></span>) that “the place of Shechem” was one of the resting-places of Abraham when he came first into Canaan, and that probably he bought a possession there, for he built an altar. The bones of Joseph were laid in Shechem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>). There were two burial-places connected with the patriarchal families. In the report of Stephen’s speech we find that Abraham is said to have bought what Jacob really purchased, but there may also have been land purchased by Abraham “in the place of Shechem.” We have only to suppose that in his speech Stephen, speaking of the burial of the whole family, mentioned, in accordance with the tradition of Josephus, the burial of the fathers in Hebron, which Abraham bought, and noticed the laying of Joseph’s bones at Shechem which Jacob bought, and that into the report of what he said a confusion has been introduced by the insertion of Abraham’s name for Jacob’s in the abbreviated narrative. We have pointed out in several places that the speeches recorded can be no more than abstracts of what was said, and the degree of inaccuracy here apparent might readily be imported in the formation of such an abstract, and yet the original speech have correctly reported all the traditions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Stephen dwells on “Shechem” in the same way as before he had dwelt on “Egypt,” to mark that in the ancient days other places were held in reverence by the chosen people, and they served God there, though at the time when he was speaking Shechem was the home of their enemies the Samaritans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-16.htm" title="And were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulcher that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.">Acts 7:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">and</span>) We may give this paraphrase of the passage: “Jacob died and our fathers (<span class="ital">namely, Joseph</span>); and (<span class="ital">because, after the example of Abraham and Sarah, Isaac and Rebecca, they wished to rest in the land of promise,</span> <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-13.htm" title="For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of a burial plot of Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.">Genesis 50:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm" title="And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from hence.">Genesis 50:25</a></span>, <span class="ital">for this reason</span>) they were carried over into Sychem or Shechem (<span class="ital">and into the sepulchre of Hebron</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/23-19.htm" title="And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the land of Canaan.">Genesis 23:19</a>), and were laid (<span class="ital">in “the parcel of ground” at Shechem</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm" title="And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance of the children of Joseph.">Joshua 24:32</a>], <span class="ital">and</span>) in the sepulchre (<span class="ital">of Hebron</span>), which Abraham had bought (<span class="ital">and Jacob</span>) for a price in money (<span class="ital">and a hundred lambs</span>) from the sons of Emmor, (the father) of Sichem or Shechem” (<span class="ital">and from Ephron</span>). For two most well known histories are intertwined with one another, having reference to a double purchase (examine well Genesis 23, 33), and to a double burial: Genesis 50 and Joshua 24. In this passage both histories require the omitted parts, by the force of the relatives, to be supplied mutually one from the other. The brevity which was best suited to the ardour of the Spirit gave Stephen just occasion, in the case of a fact so well known, to compress these details in the way he has done. Moreover there is to be added the consideration that, as Jacob was buried in the sepulchre of Hebron, and Joseph in the land of Shechem, so the rest of the fathers who died in Egypt, or (at least) some of them, are said to have been gathered to both of them. For Josephus, lib. ii. Ant. ch. iv., writes, that they were entombed at Hebron; Jerome, in Ep. ad Pammach. de opt. gen. int., informs us that their sepulchres existed even in his age at Shechem, and were wont to be visited by strangers. From which Franc. Junius, lib. i. Parall. 92, infers that some of them were buried in the one place, some in the other, according as seemed convenient to their posterity. Pererius, in Gen. fol. 672, thinks that they were carried over from Shechem to Hebron. And as it would have been too long for Stephen to have recounted these several details, he with admirable compendiousness has indicated the whole. Therefore the reading <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραὰμ</span> remains intact: nor is there need of the conjecture <span class="greekheb">Ἰακώβ</span>. Flaccius admirably observes on this passage: “Stephen has no time, in going cursorily through so many histories, to narrate each in distinct detail: therefore he compresses into one two different sepulchres, places, and purchases, in such a way that, in the case of the former history, indeed, he names the true purchaser, omitting the seller: on the other hand, in the later history, he names the true seller, omitting the purchaser; as it were by a diameter joining two out of those four contracting parties [two buyers, Abraham and Jacob, and two sellers, Ephron and Emmor or Hamor. Stephen takes and joins Abraham, the first of the first pair, and Emmor of the second]. However much, therefore, the name of the purchaser may be emended, yet still it would not be true that Jacob was buried in Shechem. Abraham bought a place of sepulture from the sons of Heth, Genesis 23; Jacob was buried there, Genesis 49, 50 : Jacob purchased a field from the sons of Emmor or Hamor, Genesis 33; Joseph was buried there, Joshua 24. Here you have a type of those contracts, and may see how Stephen contracted the two purchases into one.” So says the Illyrian (Illyricus). See also Glassius in respect to Ellipsis. In a similar way the same Stephen, a little before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-7.htm" title="And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.">Acts 7:7</a>, contracted two prophecies, viz. that to Abraham and that to Moses, into one: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-12.htm" title="And he said, Certainly I will be with you; and this shall be a token to you, that I have sent you: When you have brought forth the people out of Egypt, you shall serve God on this mountain.">Exodus 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a> : and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-9.htm" title="And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,">Acts 7:9</a> he condensed into one word the <span class="ital">selling</span> of Joseph and his removal <span class="ital">into Egypt</span>: and below, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>, he joins a saying of Amos and the departure <span class="ital">to Babylon</span>, out of Jeremiah. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-24.htm" title="And seeing one of them suffer wrong, he defended him, and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:">Acts 7:24</a>, “A certain one (an Israelite) <span class="ital">suffering wrong;—an Egyptian</span>” (inflicting the wrong) [<span class="greekheb">τινα ἀδικούμενον</span>—<span class="greekheb">τὸν Αἰγύπτιον</span>].

As regards the statement in the text, two distinct transactions seem at first sight to be mixed up. One, that Abraham bought the field of Machpelah of Ephron the Hittite for a burial-place, where he and Sarah, and Isaac and Rebekah, and Jacob and Leah, were buried (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-16.htm">Genesis 24:16, 17, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-9.htm">Genesis 25:9, 10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-27.htm">Genesis 35:27-29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>); the other, that Jacob "bought a parcel of a field..., at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father, for an hundred pieces of money," where the bones of Joseph were buried by Joshua (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-19.htm">Genesis 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-25.htm">Genesis 50:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>), and where, according to a tradition still surviving in the days of St. Jerome, the other patriarchs were also buried ('Epistol.'86," She came to Sichem, now called Neapolis (or Nablous), and from thence visited the tombs of the twelve patriarchs"). See also Jerome, 'De Optimo Genere Interpretandi. All Jewish writers, however, are wholly silent" about this tradition, perhaps from jealousy of the Samaritans (Lightfoot, vol. 8. p. 423). And Josephus affirms that all but Joseph were buried at Hebron ('Ant. Jud.,'2. 8:2); and that their beautiful marble monuments were to be seen at Hebron in his day. In the cave of Machpelah, however, there is no tomb of any of the twelve patriarchs except Joseph; and his so-called tomb is of a different character and situation from the genuine ones (Stanley's 'Lectures on Jewish Church,' 1st series, pp. 498-500. See also 'Sermons in the East': 'The Mosque of Hebron'). But on looking closer at the text it appears pretty certain that only Shechem was in Stephen's mind. For first he speaks of Shechem at once, <span class="cmt_word">And were carried over unto Shechem</span>. And adds and <span class="cmt_word">were laid in</span> <span class="cmt_word">the tomb that Abraham bought for a price in silver of the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</span> Except the one word "Abraham," the whole sentence points to Shechem. What he says of Shechem is exactly in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-18.htm">Genesis 33:18, 19</a>. And what he says of their fathers being carried over and buried at Shechem is exactly true of Joseph's bones, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-32.htm">Joshua 24:32</a>. So that the one difficulty is the word "Abraham." It seems much more probable that this word should have been interpolated by some early transcriber, who saw no nominative case to <span class="greek">&#x1f60;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, and who had in his mind a confused recollection of Abraham's purchase, than that Stephen, who shows such thorough knowledge of the Bible history, should have made a gross mistake in such a well-known and famous circumstance as the purchase of the field of Machpelah, or that Luke should have perpetuated it had he made it in the hurry of speech. It cannot be affirmed with certainty that Stephen confirms the story of the other patriarchs being buried at Shechem, though possibly he alludes to the tradition. The plural, "they were carried," etc., might be put generally, though only Joseph was meant (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-44.htm">Matthew 27:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm">Matthew 26:8</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-39.htm">Luke 23:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-4.htm">John 12:4</a>), or "the bones of Joseph" might possibly be the subject, though not expressed. Lightfoot - followed by Bishop Wordsworth, who thinks that Abraham really did buy a field of Ephron in Sychem, when he was there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>)-would thus be right in supposing that the point of Stephen's remark was that the patriarchs were buried in Shechem. </body></html>
