Suffering times often are growing times with the church. God is preparing for his people's deliverance, when their day is darkest, and their distress deepest. Moses was exceeding fair, fair toward God; it is the beauty of holiness which is in God's sight of great price. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy; for God will take special care of those of whom he designs to make special use. And did he thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he secure the interests of his holy child Jesus, from the enemies who are gathered together against him. They persecuted Stephen for disputing in defence of Christ and his gospel: in opposition to these they set up Moses and his law. They may understand, if they do not wilfully shut their eyes against the light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver them out of a worse slavery than that of Egypt. Although men prolong their own miseries, yet the Lord will take care of his servants, and effect his own designs of mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wilt thou kill me ... - How it was known that he had killed the Egyptian does not appear.

That is, is it thy will? dost thou design to kill me? or, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14</a> "intendest" thou to kill me? In the Hebrew text it is, "wilt thou kill me, dost thou say?" that is, as Aben Ezra rightly interprets it, dost thou say so "in thine heart?" which is a much better observation than that of Jarchi's; <p>"from hence we learn, says he, that he slew him by the ineffable name:'' <p>though this is the sense of some of their ancient doctors (c); <p>""to kill me dost thou say?" it is not said, "dost thou seek?" but "dost thou say?" from whence you may learn, that the ineffable name was made mention of over the Egyptian, and he slew him.'' <p>The word "yesterday" is added by Stephen, but with great truth and propriety, and is in the Septuagint version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm">Exodus 2:14</a>. The "as" here does not intend the manner of killing, whether by the fist or sword, or by pronouncing the word Jehovah, as Jarchi thinks, but killing itself, by whatsoever way; and the words were very spitefully said, on purpose to publish the thing, and to expose Moses to danger of life, as it did. <p>(c) Shemot Rabba, ib. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Wilt thou kill me, as thou diddest the Egyptian yesterday?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-28.htm" title="Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday?">Acts 7:28</a>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-14.htm" title="And he said, Who made you a prince and a judge over us? intend you to kill me, as you killed the Egyptian?
