The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joseph was made known - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-4.htm">Genesis 45:4</a>.<p>Joseph's kindred ... - His relatives; his family, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-16.htm">Genesis 45:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-16. the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt, but God was with him&#8212;Here Stephen gives his first example of Israel's opposition to God's purposes, in spite of which and by means of which those purposes were accomplished.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Upon their second coming into Egypt, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-3.htm" title="And Joseph said to his brothers, I am Joseph; does my father yet live?
