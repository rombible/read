He probably had taught that the change was about to come. He does assert (1) that the covenant of circumcision followed on the promise to Abraham, and therefore was not the ground of his election, and so lays the foundation for St. Paul’s argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>; (2) that, though part of a provisional, not of a permanent, system, it came from God’s appointment, and therefore was to be spoken of with all reverence, and so he clears himself from the charge of blasphemy.<p><span class= "bld">The twelve patriarchs.</span>—On the meaning of the word see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm" title="Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.">Acts 2:29</a>.

The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he gave him - That is, God appointed or commanded this, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-9.htm">Genesis 17:9-13</a>.<p>The covenant - The word "covenant" denotes properly "a compact or agreement between two or more persons," usually attended with seals, pledges, or sanctions. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-7.htm">Genesis 17:7</a>, and elsewhere, it is said that God would establish his "covenant" with Abraham; that is, he made him certain definite promises, attended with pledges and seals, etc. The idea of a strict "compact" or "agreement" between God and man, as between "equal parties"; is not found in the Bible. The word is commonly used, as here, to denote "a promise on the part of God," attended with pledges, and demanding, on the part of man, in order to avail himself of its benefits, a specified course of conduct. The "covenant" is therefore another name for denoting two things on the part of God:<p>(1) A "command," which man is not at liberty to reject, as he would be if it were a literal covenant; and,<p>(2) A "promise," which is to be fulfilled only on the condition of obedience. The covenant with Abraham was simply a "promise" to give him the land, and to make him a great nation, etc. It was never proposed to Abraham with the supposition that he was at liberty to reject it, or to refuse to comply with its conditions. Circumcision was appointed as the mark or indication that Abraham and those thus designated were the persons included in the gracious purpose and promise. It served to separate them as a special people; a people whose unique characteristic it was that they obeyed and served the God who had made the promise to Abraham. The phrase "covenant of circumcision" means, therefore, the covenant or promise which God made to Abraham, of which circumcision was the distinguishing "mark" or "sign."<p>The twelve patriarchs - The word "patriarch" properly denotes "the father and ruler of a family." But it is commonly applied, by way of eminence, to "the progenitors" of the Jewish race, particularly to "the twelve sons of Jacob."

The ordinary word for “covenant,” <span class="greekheb">συνθήκη</span>, is very rare in LXX (though used by the later translators, Aquila, Sym., Theod., for <span class="greekheb">בְּרִית</span>, but see also Ramsay, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, ii., pp. 322, 323 (1898)). But the word <span class="greekheb">διαθ</span>. would be suitably employed to express a <span class="ital">divine</span> covenant, because it could not be said that in such a case the contractors are in any degree of equal standing (<span class="greekheb">συνθήκη</span>). In the N.T. the sense of “covenant” is correct (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-16.htm" title="For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the death of the testator.">Hebrews 9:16</a>). But in <span class="ital">classical</span> writers from the time of Plato <span class="greekheb">διαθήκη</span> generally has the meaning of a will, a testament, a disposition of property, and in the Latin renderings of the word in the N.T. we find uniformly <span class="ital">testamentum</span> in cases where the sense of “covenant” is beyond dispute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-72.htm" title="To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;">Luke 1:72</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-25.htm" title="You are the children of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.">Acts 3:25</a> d. <span class="ital">dispositionis</span>; and here d. has <span class="ital">dispositionem</span>, also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-27.htm" title="For this is my covenant to them, when I shall take away their sins.">Romans 11:27</a>), <span class="ital">cf., e.g.</span>, in this verse, Vulgate and Par.
