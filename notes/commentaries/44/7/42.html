The narrative of the Pentateuch is inconsistent with the statement that no sacrifices were offered to Jehovah during the forty years’ wandering; but the question emphasises the thought which Amos desired to press upon the men of his generation, that Jehovah rejected the divided worship offered to them by a people who were all along hankering after, and frequently openly returning to, the worship of Egypt or Chaldæa. Moloch, and not the true God of Abraham, had been their chosen deity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?...">Acts 7:42-43</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then God turned </span>— Upon this, God, being most righteously provoked, turned away from them in anger, and, as in many other instances, punished one sin by letting them fall into another; and at length gave them up, in succeeding ages, to the most abandoned, public, and general idolatry, even <span class="ital">to worship </span>all <span class="ital">the host of heaven </span>— The stars and other heavenly bodies, and that with as little reserve, and as little shame, as the most stupid of the heathen nations. <span class="ital">As it is written in the book of the prophets </span>— Namely, of the twelve minor prophets, which the Jews always connected together in one book.

The passage consists of two parts; of which the former confirms <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-41.htm" title="And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.">Acts 7:41</a>, concerning the sin of the people; the latter, the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a>, respecting their punishment: <span class="ital">O house of Israel, have ye offered to me </span>— To me alone; <span class="ital">slain beasts, &c., forty years in the wilderness? </span>— You know that even then you began to revolt, and provoke me to jealousy with your abominations. They had offered many sacrifices, but did not offer them to God alone, but sacrificed to idols also; and God did not accept even those that they offered to him, because they did not offer them with an upright heart. And in succeeding ages you were continually renewing and aggravating your rebellions and treasons against me. <span class="ital">Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch </span>— Instead of confining yourselves to my tabernacle; <span class="ital">and the star of your god Remphan </span>— Or <span class="ital">Chium, </span>as it is called in Amos.

It was no dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to the spiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shall give way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasion has he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things show his eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who made all things. Next to the human nature of Christ, the broken and spiritual heart is his most valued temple.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then God turned - That is, turned away from them; abandoned them to their own desires.<p>The host of heaven - The stars, or heavenly bodies. The word "host" means "armies." It is applied to the heavenly bodies because they are very numerous, and appear to be "marshalled" or arrayed in military order. It is from this that God is called Yahweh "of hosts," as being the ruler of these well-arranged heavenly bodies. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-9.htm">Isaiah 1:9</a>. The proof that they did this Stephen proceeds to allege by a question from the prophets.<p>In the book of the prophets - <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm">Amos 5:25-26</a>. The twelve minor prophets were commonly written in one volume, and were called the Book of the Prophets; that is, the book containing these several prophecies, Daniel, Hosea, Micah, etc. They were small "tracts" separately, and were bound up together to preserve them from being lost. This passage is not quoted literally; it is evidently made from memory; and though in its main spirit it coincides with the passage in Amos, yet in some important respects it varies from it.<p>O ye house of Israel - Ye people of Israel.<p>Have ye offered ... - That is, ye have not offered. The interrogative form is often an emphatic way of saying that the thing had "not" been done. But it is certain that the Jews did offer sacrifices to God in the wilderness, though it is also certain that they did not do it with a pure and upright heart. They kept up the form of worship generally, but they frequently forsook God, and offered worship to idols. through the continuous space of forty years they did "not" honor God, but often departed from him, and worshipped idols. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42-50. gave them up&#8212;judicially.<p>as &#8230; written in the book of the prophets&#8212;the twelve minor prophets, reckoned as one: the passage is from Am 5:25.<p>have ye offered to me &#8230; sacrifices?&#8212;The answer is, Yes, but as if ye did it not; for "neither did ye offer to Me only, nor always, nor with a perfect and willing heart" [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then God turned, </span> from being as a Father to them, to be a Judge over them, to punish them; whereas formerly he had blessed them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And gave them up; </span> this was indeed to deliver them to Satan; God withholding his grace which they had abused, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>,25</span>, and giving them up, (to fall from one sin unto another), though not positively, yet permissively. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The host of heaven; </span> the angels are so called, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-13.htm" title="And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,">Luke 2:13</a></span>; but it is rather here to be understood of the sun, moon, and stars, which are called so, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deu 17:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-26.htm" title="Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who has created these things, that brings out their host by number: he calls them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he is strong in power; not one fails.">Isaiah 40:26</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the book of the prophets:</span> the words here referred to are in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm" title="Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?">Amos 5:25</a></span>.

This usage has not passed over to the N. T., and, moreover, it is not vouched for historically that the Israelites at an earlier period practised star-worship. Heinrichs connects <span class="greekheb">ἔστρ</span>. with <span class="greekheb">αὐτούς</span>: “convertit animos eorum ab una idololatria ad aliam.” But the expression of divine disfavour is to be retained on account of the correlation with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-39.htm" title="To whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,">Acts 7:39</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ παρέδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὺς λατρ</span>.] and gave them up to serve (an explanatory infinitive).

The assertion, often repeated since the time of Chrysostom and Theophylact, that only the divine permission or the withdrawal of grace is here denoted, is at variance with the positive expression and the true biblical conception of divine retribution.

Ye have not surely presented unto me sacrifices and offerings (offerings of any kind) for forty years in the wilderness? The question supposes a negative answer; therefore without an interrogation the meaning is: Ye cannot maintain that ye have offered … to me. The apparent contradiction with the accounts of offerings, which were actually presented to Jehovah in the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-4.htm" title="And Moses wrote all the words of the LORD, and rose up early in the morning, and built an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars, according to the twelve tribes of Israel.">Exodus 24:4</a> ff.; Numbers 7; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/9-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they were come out of the land of Egypt, saying,">Numbers 9:1</a> ff.) disappears, when the prophetic utterance, understood by Stephen as a reproach,[207] is considered as a sternly and sharply significant divine verdict, according to which the ritual offerings in the desert, which were rare and only occurred on special occasions (comp. already Lyra), <span class="ital">could not be taken at all into consideration</span> against the idolatrous aberrations which testified the moral worthlessness of those offerings. Usually (as by Morus, Rosenmüller, Heinrichs, Olshausen, similarly Kuinoel) <span class="greekheb">μοι</span> is considered as equivalent to <span class="ital">mihi soli</span>. But this is incorrect on account of the <span class="ital">enclitic</span> pronoun and its position, and on account of the arbitrarily intruded <span class="greekheb">μόνον</span>. Fritzsche (<span class="ital">ad Marc.</span> p. 65 f.) puts the note of interrogation only after <span class="greekheb">προσκυνεῖν αὐτοῖς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a> : “Sacrane et victimas per XL annos in deserto mihi obtulistis, et in pompa tulistis aedem Molochi etc.?” In this way God’s displeasure at the unstedfastness of His people would be vividly denoted by the contrast. But this expedient is impossible on account of the <span class="greekheb">μή</span> presupposing a negation. Moreover, it is as foreign to the design of Stephen, who wishes to give a probative passage for the <span class="greekheb">λατρεύειν τῇ στρατιᾷ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>, to <span class="ital">concede</span> the worship of Jehovah, as it is, on the other hand, in the highest degree accordant with that design to recognise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm" title="Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O you house of Israel, have you offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness?">Acts 7:42</a> the <span class="ital">negative</span> element of his proof (the denial of the rendering of offering to Jehovah), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a> the <span class="ital">positive</span> proof (the direct reproach of star-worship).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[207] According to <span class="ital">another</span> view, the period of forty years without offerings appears in the prophet as the “golden age of Israel,” and as a proof how little God cares for such offerings.

The Law comprised the five books of Moses. The earlier prophets were the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings: the later prophets were Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and the twelve which we now call Minor Prophets. The Hagiographa consisted of the following books in the order here given: Psalms (and the expression of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm" title="And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.">Luke 24:44</a> will be understood because the Psalms stand first in this section), Proverbs, Job, the Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther (these five last mentioned were called the five rolls, being written on separate rolls for use at special festival and fast services), Daniel, Ezra (Nehemiah), and Chronicles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">O ye house of Israel, have ye offered</span>, &c.] It is more emphatic to keep the order of the Greek.

This, according to Lightfoot, with whom most commentators agree, was in accordance with a very common practice of readers in the schools and pulpits of the Jews, to adapt and accommodate a text to their own immediate purpose, keeping, however, to historical truth. Here Stephen points to the Babylonish Captivity as the punishment of the sins of their fathers, thus warning them of more terrible judgments to follow their rejection of Christ. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>To worship (&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., more correctly, serve, See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-74.htm">Luke 1:74</a>.<p>The host of heaven<p>Star-worship, or Sabaeanism, the remnant of the ancient heathenism of Western Asia, which consisted in the worship of the stars, and spread into Syria, though the Chaldaean religion was far from being the simple worship of the host of heaven; the heavenly bodies being regarded as real persons, and not mere metaphorical representations of astronomical phenomena. It is to the Sabaean worship that Job alludes when, in asserting the purity of his life (<a href="http://biblehub.com/job/31-26.htm">Job 31:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-27.htm">Job 31:27</a>), he says: "If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in brightness, and my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath kissed my hands: this also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I should have denied the God that is above." Though not a part of the religion of the Egyptians, Rawlinson thinks it may have been connected with their earlier belief, since prayer is represented in hieroglyphics by a man holding up his hands, accompanied by a star (Herodotus, vol. ii., p. 291). </body></html>
