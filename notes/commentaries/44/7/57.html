Then, however, we must remember, the Roman procurator was present in Jerusalem. Now all restraint was removed, and fanaticism had full play. That neither office nor age was enough to guard, under such conditions, against shameful outrage has been seen even in the history of Christian assemblies, as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in that of the Robber Synod of Ephesus in A.D. 449. The caution in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1Timothy 3:3</a>, that a bishop should not be a striker, shows how near the danger was even in the apostolic age. The facts in this case seem to imply that the accusers, and perhaps also the excited crowd whom they represented, were present as listening to the speech, as well as the members of the Sanhedrin.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-57.htm" title="Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran on him with one accord,...">Acts 7:57-59</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then they cried out with a loud voice </span>— Being provoked to such a degree that they could not contain themselves, and meaning to drown the voice of Stephen; <span class="ital">and stopped their ears </span>— As if they could not bear to hear such blasphemy as they wished to have it thought he had spoken. <span class="ital">And ran upon him </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ωρμησαν</span>, <span class="ital">rushed on him with one accord, </span>before any sentence was regularly passed; <span class="ital">and cast </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εκβαλοντες εξω της πολεως</span>, <span class="ital">casting him out of the city </span>— It seems by a gate near the place where the sanhedrim sat; and as soon as they had got without the boundaries of that sacred place, of which they judged it would be a profanation to stain it with human blood, <span class="ital">they stoned him — </span>This, like the stoning of Paul at Lystra, seems to have been an act of popular fury, exceeding the power which the Jews regularly had; which, though it might have extended to passing a capital sentence, was certainly not sufficient for carrying it into execution, without the consent of the Romans. The Jews were more than once ready to stone Christ, not only when by their own confession they had not power to put any one to death, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-31.htm" title="Then said Pilate to them, Take you him, and judge him according to your law. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death:">John 18:31</a>,) but when nothing had passed which had the shadow of a legal trial. How far they now might have formed those express notions of what the rabbis call the <span class="ital">judgment of zeal, </span>is not easy to say; but it is certain they acted on that principle, and as if they had thought every private Israelite had, like Phinehas, who is pleaded as an example of it, a right to put another to death on the spot, if he found him in a capital breach of the divine law; a notion, by the way, directly contrary to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-6.htm" title="At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of one witness he shall not be put to death.">Deuteronomy 17:6</a>, which required at least two witnesses in capital cases, where there was a legal process. <span class="ital">And the </span>two <span class="ital">witnesses — </span>Whose hands were first upon him to put him to death; <span class="ital">laid down their clothes, </span>&c. — In executions of this kind, it was usual for those who had borne witness against the criminal to cast the first stones at him; and for this purpose they were wont to put off their upper garments, and gave them to be kept by persons equally hearty in the prosecution with themselves; and on this occasion the witnesses laid their clothes <span class="ital">at the feet of Saul, </span>afterward called Paul, who, it seems, willingly took charge of them, to show how heartily he concurred with them in the execution. O Saul! wouldst thou have believed, if one had told thee, while thou wast urging on the cruel multitude, that the time would come when thou thyself shouldst be twice stoned in the same cause, and shouldst triumph in committing thy soul likewise to that Jesus whom thou wast now blaspheming? His dying prayer reached thee, as well as many others. And the martyr Stephen, and Saul the persecutor, (afterward his brother, both in faith and martyrdom,) are now joined in everlasting friendship, and dwell together in the happy company of those <span class="ital">who have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:54-60 Nothing is so comfortable to dying saints, or so encouraging to suffering saints, as to see Jesus at the right hand of God: blessed be God, by faith we may see him there. Stephen offered up two short prayers in his dying moments. Our Lord Jesus is God, to whom we are to seek, and in whom we are to trust and comfort ourselves, living and dying. And if this has been our care while we live, it will be our comfort when we die. Here is a prayer for his persecutors. Though the sin was very great, yet if they would lay it to their hearts, God would not lay it to their charge. Stephen died as much in a hurry as ever any man did, yet, when he died, the words used are, he fell asleep; he applied himself to his dying work with as much composure as if he had been going to sleep. He shall awake again in the morning of the resurrection, to be received into the presence of the Lord, where is fulness of joy, and to share the pleasures that are at his right hand, for evermore.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then they cried out - That is, probably, "the people," not the members of the council It is evident he was put to death in a popular tumult.

This was their usual method; hence they say, (o). <p>"if a man hears anything that is indecent, (or not fit to be heard,) let him put his fingers in his ears hence the whole ear is hard, and the tip of it soft, that when he hears anything that is not becoming, he may bend the tip of the ear within it.'' <p>By either of these ways these men might stop their ears; either by putting in their fingers, or by turning the tip of the ear inward. <p>And ran upon him with one accord; without any leave of the sanhedrim, or waiting for their determination, in the manner the zealots did; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-4.htm">Matthew 10:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm">John 16:2</a>. <p>(o) T.
