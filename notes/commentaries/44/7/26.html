Suffering times often are growing times with the church. God is preparing for his people's deliverance, when their day is darkest, and their distress deepest. Moses was exceeding fair, fair toward God; it is the beauty of holiness which is in God's sight of great price. He was wonderfully preserved in his infancy; for God will take special care of those of whom he designs to make special use. And did he thus protect the child Moses? Much more will he secure the interests of his holy child Jesus, from the enemies who are gathered together against him. They persecuted Stephen for disputing in defence of Christ and his gospel: in opposition to these they set up Moses and his law. They may understand, if they do not wilfully shut their eyes against the light, that God will, by this Jesus, deliver them out of a worse slavery than that of Egypt. Although men prolong their own miseries, yet the Lord will take care of his servants, and effect his own designs of mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the next day - <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm">Exodus 2:13</a>.<p>He showed himself - He appeared in a sudden and unexpected manner to them.<p>Unto them - That is, to "two" of the Hebrews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm">Exodus 2:13</a>.<p>As they strove - As they were engaged in a quarrel.<p>Have set them at one - Greek: "would have urged them to peace."

One of the most melancholy scenes in the world is that, where those who are poor, and afflicted, and oppressed, add to all their other calamities altercations and strifes among themselves. Yet it is from this class that contentions and lawsuits usually arise. The address which Moses here makes to the contending Jews might be applied to the whole human family in view of the contentions and wars of nations: "Ye are "brethren," members of the same great family, and why do you contend with each other?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. next day he showed himself unto them as they strove&#8212;Here, not an Israelite and an Egyptian, but two parties in Israel itself, are in collision with each other; Moses, grieved at the spectacle, interposes as a mediator; but his interference, as unauthorized, is resented by the party in the wrong, whom Stephen identifies with the mass of the nation (Ac 7:35), just as Messiah's own interposition had been spurned.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He showed himself; </span> as one appointed by God to deliver them, which he had evidenced before. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Would have set them at one again; </span> with great earnestness, and as far as words could do, he compelled them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; </span> these words are not mentioned, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm" title="And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smite you your fellow?">Exodus 2:13</a></span>, but something otherwise than here; but the sense is here and there the same. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Brethren, </span> not so much being all descended from Abraham and the patriarchs; but in that they all worshipped one and the same God, which is the greatest obligation to concord and agreement that can be; and if any offence to be given, or trespass committed, it obliges us as much to pass it by and pardon it: <span class="ital">Forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-17.htm" title="And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light on the earth,">Genesis 1:17</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the next day he showed himself to them, as they strove,.... To two men of the Hebrews, who were quarrelling and contending with one another: these are said by the Jews (w) to be Dathan and Abiram; who were disputing and litigating the point, and were very warm, and at high words. The occasion of their contention is (x) said to be this, <p>"the Hebrew man (that had been abused) went to his house to divorce his wife, who was defiled, but she fled and told the affair to Abiram her brother: and on the morrow, Moses returned a second time to the Hebrew camp, and found Dathan and Abiram contending about the divorce.'' <p>Though some think this is prophetically said, because they afterwards contended and divided in the business of Korah (y) Moses came up to them, and let them know who he was; and this was the day after he had killed the Egyptian. So Stephen explains the "second day" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-13.htm">Exodus 2:13</a> and to this agrees what a Jewish writer (z) says, that in the morning, Moses returned a second time to the camp of the Hebrews: <p>and would have set them at one again; persuaded them to peace and concord, composed their difference, reconciled them, and made them good friends: <p>saying, sirs, ye are brethren; as Abraham said to Lot, when there was a strife between their herdsmen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-8.htm">Genesis 13:8</a> and if these two were Dathan and Abiram, they were brethren in the strictest sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a><p>why do ye wrong one to another? by abusing each other, calling ill names, or striking one another; or by lifting up the hand to strike, as Jonathan the Targumist says Dathan did against Abiram. <p>(w) Shalshalet, ib.
