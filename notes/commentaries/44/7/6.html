Taking the common computation, the interval between the covenant with Abraham and that with Moses was 430 years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>), of which only 215 are reckoned as spent in Egypt. The Israelites were indeed sojourners in a strange land for the whole 430 years, but the history shows that they were not in bondage nor evil entreated till the Pharaoh arose who knew not Joseph. The chronological difficulty, however, lies in reconciling St. Paul’s statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a> with the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a>, which gives 400 years as the sojourning in Egypt, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which gives 430, and with which St. Stephen is in substantial agreement. St. Paul appears to have followed the LXX. reading of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, which inserts “in the land of Cannan,” and in some MSS. “they and their fathers,” and with this the Samaritan Pentateuch agrees. Josephus varies, in some passages (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 15, § 2), giving 215 years; in others (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> ii. 9, § 1; <span class= "ital">Wars, </span>v. 9, § 4), 400. All that can be said is, as before, that chronological accuracy did not affect the argument in either case. It was enough for St. Stephen, as for St. Paul, to accept this or that system of dates, as they had been taught, without inquiring into the grounds on which it rested. Such inquiries were foreign to the Jewish character generally, and above all to that character when possessed by the sense of new and divine realities. Round numbers were enough for them to mark the successive stages of God’s dealings with His people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years....">Acts 7:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And God spake, that his seed should sojourn in a strange land</span> — When God had brought Abraham into this country, he did not keep him and his posterity here till the time when they were to enter upon the possession of it, in consequence of this divine grant; but, on the contrary, God informed him in a vision that his seed should be strangers in a foreign land, and that they among whom they sojourned should <span class="ital">bring them into bondage </span>— Should make them slaves; <span class="ital">and entreat them evil </span>— Use them with great cruelty; and that these events, with the circumstances preparatory to them, should extend themselves to the full period of four hundred years.

The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And God spake on this wise - In this manner, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm">Genesis 15:13-14</a>.<p>His seed - His posterity; his descendants.<p>Should sojourn - This means that they would have a "temporary residence there."

Great perplexity has been experienced in explaining this passage, or reconciling it with other statements. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a>, it is said that their sojourning in Egypt was 430 years. Josephus (Antiq., book 2, chapter 9, section 1) also says that the time in which they were in Egypt was 400 years; though in another place (Antiq., book 2, chapter 15, section 2) he says that they left Egypt f 430 years after their forefather, Abraham, came to Canaan, but 215 years after Jacob removed to Egypt. Paul also <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a> says that it was 430 years from the time when the promise was given to Abraham to the time when the Law was given on Mount Sinai. The Samaritan Pentateuch also says <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm">Exodus 12:40</a> that the "dwelling of the sons of Israel, and of their fathers, which they dwelt "in the land of Canaan," and in the land of Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years."<p>The same is the version of the Septuagint. "A part" of this perplexity is removed by the fact that Stephen and Moses use, in accordance with a very common custom, "round numbers" in speaking of it, and thus speak of 400 years when the literal time was 430. The other perplexities are not so easily removed. From the account which Moses has given of the lives of certain persons, it would seem clear that the time which they spent in "Egypt" was not 400 years. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-8.htm">Genesis 46:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/46-11.htm">Genesis 46:11</a>, it appears that "Kohath" was born when Jacob went into Egypt. He lived 133 years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-18.htm">Exodus 6:18</a>. Amram, his son, and the father of Moses lived 137 years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-20.htm">Exodus 6:20</a>. Moses was 80 years old when he was sent to Pharaoh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7</a>. The whole time thus mentioned, including the time in which the father lived after his son was born, was only 350 years. Exclusive of that, it is reasonable to suppose that the actual time of their being in Egypt could not have been but about 200 years, according to one account of Josephus. The question then is, how can these accounts be reconciled? The only satisfactory way is by supposing that the 430 years includes the whole time from the calling of Abraham to the departure from Egypt. And that this was the fact is probable from the following circumstances:<p>(1) The purpose of all the narratives on this subject is to trace the period before they became finally settled in the land of Canaan. During all this period from the calling of Abraham, they were in a wandering, unfixed situation. This constituted substantially one period, including all their oppressions, hardships, and dangers; and it was natural to have reference to this "entire" period in any account which was given.<p>(2) all this period was properly the period of "promise," not of "possession." In this respect the wanderings of Abraham and the oppressions of Egypt came under the same general description.<p>(3) Abraham was himself occasionally in Egypt. He was unsettled; and since Egypt was so pre-eminent in all their troubles, it was natural to speak of all their oppressions as having occurred in that country. The phrase "residence in Egypt," or "in a strange land," would come to be synonymous, and would denote all their oppressions and trials. They would speak of their sufferings as having been endured in Egypt, because their afflictions there were so much more prominent than before.<p>(4) all this receives countenance from the version of the Septuagint, and from the Samaritan text, showing the manner in which the ancient Jews were accustomed to understand it.<p>(5) it should be added, that difficulties of chronology are more likely to occur than any others; and it should not be deemed strange if there are perplexities of this kind found in ancient writings which we cannot explain. It is so in all ancient records; and all that is usually expected in relation to such difficulties is that we should be able to present a "probable" explanation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-8. four hundred years&#8212;using round numbers, as in Ge 15:13, 16 (see on [1959]Ga 3:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Should sojourn in a strange land, </span> as men which dwell in houses that are not their own; which seem to contradict the promise mentioned in the foregoing verse; but it is only to make Abraham the more believe against hope in hope, as it is said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-18.htm" title="Who against hope believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations, according to that which was spoken, So shall your seed be.">Romans 4:18</a></span>: though there were never so many difficulties more, for what God hath promised faith would overcome them all.

The period named belongs not only to <span class="greekheb">κακώσουσιν</span> but also to <span class="greekheb">ἔσται</span>, as Meyer rightly observes. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a> four hundred and thirty years are mentioned as the sojourning which Israel sojourned in Egypt, and in both passages the whole space of time is so occupied; or, at all events it may be fairly said that this is implied in the Hebrew text in both <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;">Genesis 15:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a> : <span class="ital">cf.</span> also for the same mode of reckoning Philo, <span class="ital">Quis rer. div. her.</span>, 54, p. 511, Mang.

For an explanation of the point see Lightfoot, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>, who regards the number in Genesis as given in round numbers, but in Exodus with historical exactness (to the same effect Wendt, Felten, Zöckler). But in the LXX version, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-40.htm" title="Now the sojourning of the children of Israel, who dwelled in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years.">Exodus 12:40</a>, the four hundred and thirty years cover the sojourn both in Egypt and in Canaan, thus including the sojourn of the Patriarchs in Canaan before the migration, and reducing the actual residence in Egypt to about half this period, the Vatican MS. reading four hundred and thirty-five years after adding <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν γῇ Χαναὰν</span> (the word <span class="ital">five</span>, however, <span class="greekheb">πέντε</span>, being erased), and the Alexandrian MS. reading after <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χαναὰν</span> the words <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ καὶ οἱ πατέρες αὐτῶν</span>, making the revision in the chronology more decisive. This is the chronology adopted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>, and by Josephus, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, ii., 15, 2; but the latter writer in other passages, <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, ii., 9, 1, and <span class="ital">B.J.</span>, v., 9, 4, adopts the same reckoning as we find here in Acts.

The period is reckoned so as to include part of the lives of the patriarchs in Canaan, and the variation may be accounted for if one number dates back to the first call, and the second only to the departure from Haran; or the one may be reckoned from the time of the covenant of circumcision, and the other from the promise of the land. Or it may be that one is merely a round number and the other an attempt at greater exactness. We can come to no certain conclusion in the matter, but we can see that both numbers were current among the Jews, for Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. ii. 15. 2) makes the time 430 years, and elsewhere (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. ii. 9. 1, and Bell. <span class="ital">Jud</span>. v. 9. 4) 400 years.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-6.htm" title="And God spoke on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.">Acts 7:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but</span>) The antithesis between the <span class="ital">promise</span> and the time of its fulfilment, which was <span class="ital">to be waited for</span>[46]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ἜΣΤΑΙ ΤῸ ΣΠΈΡΜΑ ΑὐΤΟῦ ΠΆΡΟΙΚΟΝ ἘΝ Γῇ ἈΛΛΟΤΡΊᾼ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΔΟΥΛΏΣΟΥΣΙΝ ΑὐΤῸ ΚΑῚ ΚΑΚΏΣΟΥΣΙΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἜΤΗ ΤΕΤΡΑΚΌΣΙΑ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΚΑῚ ΤῸ ἜΘΝΟς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἘΓῺ</span></span></span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/15-13.htm" title="And he said to Abram, Know of a surety that your seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs, and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;...">Genesis 15:13-14</a>, LXX., <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὍΤΙ ΠΆΡΟΙΚΟΝ ἜΣΤΑΙ ΤῸ ΣΠΈΡΜΆ ΣΟΥ ἘΝ Γῇ ΟὐΚ ἸΔῖᾼ</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΔΟΥΛΏΣΟΥΣΙΝ ΑὐΤΟῪς ΚΑῚ ΚΑΚΏΣΟΥΣΙΝ ΑὐΤΟῪς ΚΑῚ ΤΑΠΕΙΝΏΣΟΥΣΙΝ ΑὐΤΟῪς</span></span></span>, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΕΤΡΑΚΌΣΙΑ ἜΤΗ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΤῸ ΔῈ ἜΘΝΟς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ἘΓΏ</span></span></span>.—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΛΟΤΡΊᾼ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">a strange</span>) Egypt was not then named.

And this sojourning as strangers and pilgrims lasted altogether four hundred and thirty years, vie. two hundred and fifteen years in Canaan, and two hundred and fifteen in Egypt; which agrees exactly with St. Paul's reckoning in round numbers of four hundred years from the giving of the promise to Abraham to the giving of the Law on Mount Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm">Galatians 3:17</a>).
