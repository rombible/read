So that God’s favour is not a necessary consequence of inhabiting this land. All along Stephen intimates two things: 1st, That God always loved good men in every land. 2d, That he never loved bad men even in this. <span class="ital">Unto the days of David </span>— That is, the tabernacle continued for many ages, even unto David’s time, to be the resort of the pious worshippers in Israel; above four hundred years before there was any thought of building a temple.

For, as he had been a man of war, and had shed much blood, God would not permit him to build the temple. He laid a plan for it, however, and consecrated a considerable part of the spoils which he had taken from the enemy toward erecting it. But God remained without any temple till <span class="ital">Solomon built him a house </span>— Which, till the reign of that prince, he never had commanded or permitted to be done.

It was no dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to the spiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shall give way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasion has he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things show his eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who made all things. Next to the human nature of Christ, the broken and spiritual heart is his most valued temple.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tabernacle of witness - The "tent" or "tabernacle" which Moses was commanded to make. It was called a tabernacle of "witness," or of "testimony," because it was the visible witness or proof of God's presence with them; the evidence that he to whom it was devoted was their protector and guide. The name is given either to the "tent," to the two tables of stone, or to the ark; all of which were "witnesses," or "evidences" of God's relation to them as their Lawgiver and guide, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-34.htm">Exodus 16:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm">Exodus 25:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-21.htm">Exodus 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/27-21.htm">Exodus 27:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/30-6.htm">Exodus 30:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-36.htm">Exodus 30:36</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>, etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-53.htm">Numbers 1:53</a>.

In the previous part of this defense he had shown his respect for Moses and his Law. He now proceeds to show that he did not design to speak with disrespect of the temple, or the holy places of their worship. He therefore expresses his belief in the divine appointment of both the tabernacle <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-44.htm">Acts 7:44-46</a> and of the temple <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-47.htm">Acts 7:47</a>.<p>According to the fashion ... - According to the pattern that was shown to him, by which it was to be made, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-9.htm">Exodus 25:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-30.htm">Exodus 26:30</a>.

The Ethiopic version adds, "of Sinai"; there it was that the tabernacle was first ordered to be built, and there it was built, and set up; which was a sort of a portable temple, in which Jehovah took up his residence, and which was carried from place to place: of it, and its several parts and furniture, there is a large account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-1.htm">Exodus 25:1</a>. It is sometimes called Ohel Moed, or "the tabernacle of the congregation", because there the people of Israel gathered together, and God met with them; and sometimes "the tabernacle of the testimony", or "witness", as here; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-21.htm">Exodus 38:21</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-50.htm">Numbers 1:50</a> because the law, called the tables of the testimony, and the testimony, it being a testification or declaration of the will of God, was put into an ark; which for that reason is called the ark of the testimony; and which ark was placed in the tabernacle; and hence that took the same name too. The Jewish writers say (k), it is so called, <p>"because it was a testimony that the Shekinah dwelt in Israel''; <p>or as another (l) expresses it, <p>"it was a testimony to Israel that God had pardoned them concerning the affair of the calf, for, lo, his Shekinah dwelt among them.'' <p>This tabernacle, in which was the testimony of the will of God, what he would have done, and how he would be worshipped, and which was a token of his presence, was among the Jewish fathers whilst they were in the wilderness; and is mentioned as an aggravation of their sin, that they should now, or afterwards, take up and carry the tabernacle of Mo. The Alexandrian copy reads, "your fathers"; the sense is the same. <p>As he had appointed; that is, as God appointed, ordered, and commanded: <p>speaking unto Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-40.htm">Exodus 25:40</a><p>that he should make it according to the fashion he had seen; when in the Mount with God; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm">Hebrews 8:5</a> for it was not a bare account of the tabernacle, and its vessels, which he hearing, might form an idea of in his mind; but there was a visible form represented to his eye, a pattern, exemplar, or archetype of the whole, according to which everything was to be made; which teaches us, that everything in matters of worship ought to be according to the rule which God has given, from which we should never swerve in the least. <p>(k) Baal Hatturim in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33.htm">Exodus 33</a>.21.
