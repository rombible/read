This, <span class= "ital">primâ facie, </span>suggests the conclusion that he lived for sixty years after his son’s departure. The explanations sometimes given—(1) that Abraham may have been the youngest, not the eldest son of Terah, placed first in order of honour, not of time, as Shem is among the sons of Noah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm" title="And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 5:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-10.htm" title="And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.">Genesis 6:10</a>), though Japheth was the elder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>); and (2) that the marriage of Abraham’s son with the granddaughter of Nahor by the youngest of his eight sons, Bethuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-22.htm" title="And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.">Genesis 22:22</a>), suggests some such difference of age, and that he may therefore have been born when Terah was 130, and so have remained in Haran till his father’s death—though probable as an hypothesis, would hardly appear so natural an explanation as that the memory of St. Stephen or of his reporter dwelt upon the broad outlines of the history, and was indifferent to chronological details. It is remarkable that like difficulties present themselves in St. Paul’s own survey of the history of Israel. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-20.htm" title="And after that he gave to them judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.">Acts 13:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-17.htm" title="And this I say, that the covenant, that was confirmed before of God in Christ, the law, which was four hundred and thirty years after, cannot cancel, that it should make the promise of none effect.">Galatians 3:17</a>.)

The slow steps by which the promise made to Abraham advanced toward performance, plainly show that it had a spiritual meaning, and that the land intended was the heavenly. God owned Joseph in his troubles, and was with him by the power of his Spirit, both on his own mind by giving him comfort, and on those he was concerned with, by giving him favour in their eyes. Stephen reminds the Jews of their mean beginning as a check to priding themselves in the glories of that nation. Likewise of the wickedness of the patriarchs of their tribes, in envying their brother Joseph; and the same spirit was still working in them toward Christ and his ministers. The faith of the patriarchs, in desiring to be buried in the land of Canaan, plainly showed they had regard to the heavenly country. It is well to recur to the first rise of usages, or sentiments, which have been perverted. Would we know the nature and effects of justifying faith, we should study the character of the father of the faithful. His calling shows the power and freeness of Divine grace, and the nature of conversion. Here also we see that outward forms and distinctions are as nothing, compared with separation from the world, and devotedness to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Land of the Chaldeans - From Ur of the Chaldees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>.<p>When his father was dead - This passage has given rise to no small difficulty in the interpretation. The difficulty is this: From <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26</a>, it would seem that Abraham was born when Terah was 70 years of age. "And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and Haran." From <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm">Genesis 12:4</a>, it seems that Abraham was 75 years of age when he departed from Haran to Canaan. The age of Terah was therefore but 145 years. Yet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm">Genesis 11:32</a>, it is said that Terah was 205 old when he died, thus leaving 60 years of Terah's life beyond the time when Abraham left Haran. Various modes have been proposed of explaining this difficulty:<p>(1) Errors in "numbers" are more likely to occur than any other. In the "Samaritan" copy of the Pentateuch, it is said that Terah died in Haran at the age of 105 years, which would suppose that his death occurred 40 years before Abraham left Haran. But the Hebrew, Latin, Vulgate, Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic read it as 205 years.<p>(2) it is not affirmed that Abraham was born just at the time when Terah was 70 years of age. All that the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-26.htm">Genesis 11:26</a> proves, according to the usual meaning of similar expressions, is, that Terah was 70 years old before he had any sons, and that the three were born subsequently to that. But which was born first or what intervals intervened between their birth does not appear. Assuredly, it does not mean that all were born precisely at the time when Terah was 70 years of age. Neither does it appear that Abraham was the oldest of the three. The sons of Noah are said to have been Shem, Ham, and Japheth <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-32.htm">Genesis 5:32</a>; yet Japheth, though mentioned last, was the oldest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm">Genesis 10:21</a>. As Abraham afterward became much the most distinguished, and as he was the father of the Jewish people, of whom Moses was writing, it was natural that he should be mentioned first if it cannot be proveD that Abraham was the oldest, as assuredly it cannot be, then there is no improbability in supposing that his birth might have occurred many years after Terah was 70 years of age.<p>(3) the Jews unanimously affirm that Terah relapsed into idolatry before Abraham left Haran; and this they denominate "death," or a moral death (Kuinoel). It is certain, therefore, that, from some cause, they were accustomed to speak of Terah as "dead" before Abraham left him. Stephen only used language which was customary among the Jews, and would employ it, doubtless, correctly, though we may not be able to see precisely how it can be reconciled with the account in Genesis. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. when his father was dead, he removed into this land&#8212;Though Abraham was in Canaan before Terah's death, his settlement in it as the land of promise is here said to be after it, as being in no way dependent on the family movement, but a transaction purely between Jehovah and Abraham himself.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Abraham had as great a love to his kindred and native country as others have; but he had a greater faith, which made him yield to God’s call and command, and follow from place to place the will of God, who is said here to have removed Abraham, and does choose the inheritance and habitation for his people, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm" title="He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of Jacob whom he loved.

Now, as Abraham was 75 years old when he went from Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a>; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> i. 7. 1), it follows that <span class="ital">Terah, after this departure of his son, lived</span> 60 <span class="ital">years</span>. Once more, therefore, we encounter a deviation from the biblical narrative, which is found also in Philo, <span class="ital">de migr.

The circumstance that the death of Terah is narrated at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a> (proleptically, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-4.htm" title="And when he had apprehended him, he put him in prison, and delivered him to four squads of soldiers to keep him; intending after Easter to bring him forth to the people.">Acts 12:4</a>) before the migration, does not alter the state of matters historically, and cannot, with an inviolable belief in inspiration, at all justify the expedient of Baumgarten, p. 134.[197] The various <span class="ital">attempts at reconciliation</span> are to be rejected as arbitrarily forced: <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the proposal (Knatchbull, Cappellus, Bochart, Whiston) to insert at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>, instead of 205, according to the Samaritan text 145 (but even the latter is corrupted, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a> was not understood proleptically, and therefore it was thought necessary to correct it);[198] or the ingenious refinement which, after Augustine, particularly Chladenius (<span class="ital">de conciliat. Mosis et Steph. circa annos Abr.</span>, Viteb. 1710), Loescher, Wolf, Bengel, and several older interpreters have defended, that <span class="greekheb">μετῴκισεν</span> is to be understood, not of the <span class="ital">transferring</span> generally, but of the giving <span class="ital">quiet and abiding</span> possession, to which Abraham only attained after the death of his father. More recently (Michaelis, Krause, Kuinoel, Luger, Olshausen) it has been assumed that Stephen here follows the tradition (Lightf. <span class="ital">in loc.</span>; Michael. <span class="ital">de chronol.

According to this view, <span class="greekheb">ἀποθανεῖν</span> would have to be understood <span class="ital">spiritually</span>, which the context does not in the least degree warrant, and which no one would hit upon, if it were not considered a necessity that no deviation from Genesis <span class="ital">l.c.</span> should be admitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετῴκισεν</span>] namely, <span class="ital">God</span>.

Blass seems to adopt a somewhat similar view, as he commends the reading in Gigas: “priusquam mortuus est pater ejus,” for the obedience of the patriarch, who did not hesitate to leave even his father, is opposed to the obstinacy of the Jewish people (see Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). Other attempts at explanation are that reference is made to <span class="ital">spiritual</span> death of Terah, who is supposed to have relapsed into idolatry at Haran, a view which appears to have originated with the Rabbis, probably to get rid of the chronological difficulty (Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Hor. Heb.</span>; Meyer-Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>), but for which there is absolutely no justification in the context; or that Abraham need not have been the eldest son of Terah, but that he was mentioned first because he was the most famous, a view adopted with more or less variation by Wordsworth, Hackett, and recently by Felten (see too B.D.2, p. 16, note), but apparently in opposition to the authority of Hamburger, who states that Terah was seventy years old when Abraham was born, that he was alive when Abraham departed at the age of seventy-five, being released from the duty of caring for his father by the more imperative command to obey the call of God. Lumby quotes from <span class="ital">Midrash Rabbah</span>, on Genesis, cap. 39, that God absolved Abraham from the care of his father, and yet, lest Abraham’s departure from Terah should lead others to claim the same relaxation of a commandment for themselves, Terah’s death is mentioned in holy Holy Scripture before Abraham’s departure, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-1.htm" title="Now the LORD had said to Abram, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and from your father's house, to a land that I will show you:">Genesis 12:1</a>. One other solution has been attempted by maintaining that <span class="greekheb">μετῴκισεν</span> does not refer to the removal, but only to the quiet and abiding settlement which Abraham gained <span class="ital">after</span> his father’s death, but this view, although supported by Augustine and Bengel, amongst others, is justly condemned by Alford and Wendt. The Samaritan Pentateuch reads in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-32.htm" title="And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and Terah died in Haran.">Genesis 11:32</a>, 145 instead of 205, probably an alteration to meet the apparent contradiction.

On this Jewish literature has the explanation (<span class="ital">Midrash Rabbah</span> on Genesis, cap. 39) that God absolved Abraham from the care of his father, and yet, that Abraham’s departure from Terah should not lead others to claim the same relaxation of a commandment for themselves, Terah’s death is noticed in Holy Writ before Abraham’s departure, and it is also added, to explain the mention of <span class="ital">death</span>, that “the wicked (and among them Terah is reckoned, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-2.htm" title="And Joshua said to all the people, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Your fathers dwelled on the other side of the flood in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father of Nachor: and they served other gods.">Joshua 24:2</a>) are called dead while they are alive.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he removed him</span>] i.e. God caused him to migrate.

It is not without mystery (symbolical meaning), that the father of Abraham did not enter the land of Canaan: for so it was evident, that it was not by the right of worldly inheritance that this land fell to himself and his posterity.—<span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>) at this present day.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> <span class="accented">- Haran</span> for <span class="accented">Charran</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">God removed</span> for <span class="accented">he</span> removed, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Chaldaeans</span>.
