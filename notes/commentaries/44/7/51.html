The excitement of the Sanhedrin, perhaps of the listening crowd also, at this point, would seem to have become uncontrollable. The accused seemed to them to be repeating his offence with defiant boldness, and loud clamours took the place of whispered murmurs. Both the adjectives had been applied to the sins of the older Israel; “stiffnecked” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-5.htm" title="For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, You are a stiff necked people: I will come up into the middle of you in a moment, and consume you: therefore now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do to you.">Exodus 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm" title="And he said, If now I have found grace in your sight, O LORD, let my LORD, I pray you, go among us; for it is a stiff necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your inheritance.">Exodus 34:9</a>; “uncircumcised” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm" title="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.">Jeremiah 6:10</a>. The actual phrase “uncircumcised in heart” had been used by Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm" title="In that you have brought into my sanctuary strangers, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when you offer my bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant because of all your abominations.">Ezekiel 44:7</a>) of “strangers.” It was now applied to those who boasted of their exclusive privileges as Israelites, and it is scarcely possible for us to estimate the sharp incisiveness with which it, or its Aramaic equivalent, must have fallen on the ears of the Sanhedrin. It was to them all, and more than all, that “heretic” and “infidel” have been in the controversies of Christians. Here again, in St. Paul’s “circumcision of the heart” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-29.htm" title="But he is a Jew, which is one inwardly; and circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter; whose praise is not of men, but of God.">Romans 2:29</a>), we have another echo from St. Stephen’s speech.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you....">Acts 7:51-53</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye stiff-necked, </span>&c. — Stephen, finding by a confused murmur in the place that they understood whither his discourse tended, and perceiving by the eagerness of their countenances that they would soon interrupt him, applied himself more closely to his persecutors in these remarkable words, which he boldly addressed to them under the influence of the Holy Spirit, by whose direction he spoke; <span class="ital">Ye stiff-necked </span>— Inflexible and obstinate sinners, not bowing your necks to God’s yoke; <span class="ital">and uncircumcised in heart and ears </span>— So that you will not hearken to instruction, or be seriously affected with it.

Attempts, however, were sometimes made to cut off all the prophets of the Lord at once. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1 Kings 19:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-14.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: because the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1 Kings 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm" title="But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>. <span class="ital">They have slain</span> <span class="ital">them which showed before of the coming of the Just </span>or righteous <span class="ital">One </span>— That is, Christ; so called by way of eminence, as being alone perfectly righteous: <span class="ital">of whom </span>— When you ought to have heard of him with delight, and to have received him with the most humble reverence and joyful gratitude; <span class="ital">you have been now the </span>perfidious <span class="ital">betrayers, </span>and cruel <span class="ital">murderers.

Therefore he broke off, and by the Spirit of wisdom, courage, and power, sharply rebuked his persecutors. When plain arguments and truths provoke the opposers of the gospel, they should be shown their guilt and danger. They, like their fathers, were stubborn and wilful. There is that in our sinful hearts, which always resists the Holy Ghost, a flesh that lusts against the Spirit, and wars against his motions; but in the hearts of God's elect, when the fulness of time comes, this resistance is overcome. The gospel was offered now, not by angels, but from the Holy Ghost; yet they did not embrace it, for they were resolved not to comply with God, either in his law or in his gospel. Their guilt stung them to the heart, and they sought relief in murdering their reprover, instead of sorrow and supplication for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye stiff-necked - The discourse of Stephen has every appearance of having been interrupted by the clamors and opposition of the Sanhedrin. This verse has no immediate connection with what precedes, and appears to have been spoken in the midst of opposition and clamor. If we may conjecture in this case, it would seem that the Jews saw the drift of his argument; that they interrupted him; and that when the tumult had somewhat subsided, he addressed them in the language of this verse, showing them that they sustained a character precisely similar to their rebellious fathers. The word "stiff-necked" is often used in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm">Exodus 33:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-5.htm">Exodus 33:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-9.htm">Exodus 34:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>, etc. It is a figurative expression taken from oxen that are refractory, and that will not submit to be yoked. Applied to people, it means that they are stubborn, contumacious, and unwilling to submit to the restraints of Law.<p>Uncircumcised in heart - Circumcision was a sign of being a Jew - of acknowledging the authority of the laws of Moses. It was also emblematic of purity, and of submission to the Law of God. The expression "uncircumcised in heart" denotes those who were not willing to acknowledge that Law, and submit to it. They had hearts filled with vicious and unsubdued affections and desires.<p>And ears - That is, who are unwilling to "hear" what God says.

Ye stiffnecked &#8230; ye do always resist the Holy Ghost, &c.&#8212;It has been thought that symptoms of impatience and irritation in the audience induced Stephen to cut short his historical sketch. But as little farther light could have been thrown upon Israel's obstinacy from subsequent periods of the national history on the testimony of their own Scriptures, we should view this as the summing up, the brief import of the whole Israelitish history&#8212;grossness of heart, spiritual deafness, continuous resistance of the Holy Ghost, down to the very council before whom Stephen was pleading.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Stiff necked; </span> a metaphor taken from heifers that are unaccustomed to the yoke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Uncircumcised in heart; </span> such as had still depraved affections, which they ought to have put away rather than the foreskin of their flesh; for they were commanded to circumcise their hearts, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deu 10:16</a></span>, which also God promised to do for his people, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deu 30:6</a></span>.

Though it will be allowed, that the Holy Ghost in the operations of his grace upon the heart in conversion may be resisted, that is, opposed; but not so as to be overcome or be hindered in, or be obliged to cease from, the work of conversion, insomuch that may come to nothing: <p>as your fathers did, so do ye; or as "your fathers were, so are ye"; as they were stiffnecked, self-willed, obstinate, and inflexible, so are ye; as they were uncircumcised in heart and ears, so are ye; and as they resisted the Spirit of God in his prophets, so do ye resist him in the apostles and ministers of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Ye stiffnecked and <span class="cverse3">{x}</span> uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers <i>did</i>, so <i>do</i> ye.</span><p>(7) Steven, moved with the zeal of God, at length judges his own judges.<p>(x) They are of uncircumcised hearts who still lie drowned in the sins of nature, and are stuck fast in them: for otherwise all the Jews were circumcised with regard to the flesh, and therefore there are two kinds of circumcision; Ro 2:28-29.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>.

And now it is time that the accused should become the bold accuser, and at length throw in the face of his judges the result, the thoughts forming which were already clearly enough to be inferred from the previous historical course of the speech.

Similar expressions occur in Philo and the Rabbis, and also <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-48.htm" title="That they should also leave their children uncircumcised, and make their souls abominable with all manner of uncleanness and profanation:">1Ma 1:48</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/2-46.htm" title="And what children soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly.">1Ma 2:46</a>, and see further Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, pp. 150, 151. Many writers have maintained that St. Stephen’s sharp and abrupt declaration marks the increasing impatience of his hearers at this point, as if the speaker felt that the murmurs of his audience would not allow him much more speech. But on the other hand St. Stephen’s whole speech led up to this point, and his words were not so much an interruption, but a continuance and a summary of what had gone before. No doubt the speech was left unfinished: “cujus cursus ad Iesum tendebat” (Blass); since in His rejection the obstinacy of the people which had marked and marred their history had reached its climax; and the indignant words of St. Stephen bring to mind the indignation of a greater than he against the hyprocrisy and wilfulness of the nation—“the wrath of the Lamb” against the Pharisees and the oppressors (Briggs, <span class="ital">Messiah of the Apostles</span>, p. 68).—<span class="greekheb">ἀεὶ</span>: “summa tractationis—<span class="ital">semper</span> quotiescumque vocamini” Bengel.—<span class="greekheb">ἀντιπίπτετε</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm" title="For you rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin, in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.">Numbers 27:14</a>, of Israel striving against God, and also in Polyb. and Plut.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">51</span>. <span class="ital">Ye stiffnecked</span>] A charge often brought against the Jews in the Old Testament, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff necked people:">Exodus 32:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-3.htm" title="To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the middle of you; for you are a stiff necked people: lest I consume you in the way.">Exodus 33:3</a>, &c., so that it is a very suitable expression when Stephen is declaring that the people of his time were “as their fathers.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and uncircumcised in heart and ears</span>] As the rite of circumcision was the sign of submission to the Jewish religion in its fullest requirements, so the word <span class="ital">uncircumcised</span> became a synonym for obstinate resistance to what God had revealed, and the phrase in the text consequently signifies “ye who shut your heart and ears against the truth.” For this metaphorical application cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm" title="And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm" title="Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff necked.">Deuteronomy 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-10.htm" title="To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot listen: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it.">Jeremiah 6:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It seems very likely that at this part of his discourse Stephen saw that the language he had been using was distasteful to his audience, and therefore he applied to them words which implied how far they were from being God’s people though they called themselves Israelites. They were in his eyes as those whom they called “sinners of the Gentiles.” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-15.htm" title="We who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,">Galatians 2:15</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye do always resist the Holy Ghost</span>] From the days of Moses, whom their fathers would not obey, down to the days of Jesus, whom they had crucified.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-51.htm" title="You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, you do always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do you.">Acts 7:51</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σκληροτράχηλοι</span>, <span class="ital">stiff-necked</span>) The <span class="ital">heart</span> and <span class="ital">tongue</span> are required in confession: the <span class="ital">heart, ears</span>, and <span class="ital">neck</span>,[55] are required in receiving the truth.

In applying this expression to his hearers, Stephen was using the identical language of Moses when he conveyed God's rebuke to them. Considering that they professed to be standing on Moses' side against Stephen, this must have made his words doubly cutting to them. <span class="cmt_word">Uncircumcised in heart</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> only occurs here in the New Testament, but it is found in 2 Macc. 1:51 2Macc. 2:46; and in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-48.htm">Exodus 12:48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/14-3.htm">Judges 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-26.htm">1 Samuel 17:26</a>, and elsewhere for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b9;&#x5e8;&#x5b5;&#x5dc;</span>. The word, in its application to his Jewish audience, contains a whole volume of rebuke. They prided themselves on their circumcision, they trusted in it as a sure ground of favor in the sight of God; but all the while they were on a level with the heathen whom they despised, and were to be reckoned among the uncircumcised whom they loathed. For they were without the true circumcision, that of the heart. Here again Stephen was teaching in the exact spirit and even words of Moses and the prophets. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-41.htm">Leviticus 26:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-16.htm">Deuteronomy 10:16</a> (where Stephen's two reproaches occur together); <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm">Jeremiah 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-7.htm">Ezekiel 44:7</a>; and many other passages.
