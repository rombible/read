It would, perhaps, have been better, as a general rule, to have reproduced the Hebrew rather than the Greek form of Old Testament names in the English version of the New. On the other hand, there is, in this instance, something gained in our attention being called to the identity of the two names. It is noticeable that though Stephen was on his trial as a disciple of Jesus of Nazareth, that name does not pass his lips as he speaks in his defence, except in this reference to the great captain of Israel. It is possible that under this reticence, there may have been a half-veiled reference to Him who, also bearing the name that marked Him out as a Saviour, had come, after another fashion, “into the possession of the Gentiles.” The word for “possession” is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-5.htm" title="And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.">Acts 7:5</a>, but not elsewhere in the New Testament. In the LXX. it is common enough, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-11.htm" title="And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.">Genesis 47:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-24.htm" title="And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.">Leviticus 25:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-51.htm" title="Because you trespassed against me among the children of Israel at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you sanctified me not in the middle of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:51</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:42-50 Stephen upbraids the Jews with the idolatry of their fathers, to which God gave them up as a punishment for their early forsaking him. It was no dishonour, but an honour to God, that the tabernacle gave way to the temple; so it is now, that the earthly temple gives way to the spiritual one; and so it will be when, at last, the spiritual shall give way to the eternal one. The whole world is God's temple, in which he is every where present, and fills it with his glory; what occasion has he then for a temple to manifest himself in? And these things show his eternal power and Godhead. But as heaven is his throne, and the earth his footstool, so none of our services can profit Him who made all things. Next to the human nature of Christ, the broken and spiritual heart is his most valued temple.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Our fathers that came after - None of the generation that came out of Egypt were permitted to enter into the and of Canaan except Caleb and Joshua, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-22.htm">Numbers 14:22-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/32-11.htm">Numbers 32:11-12</a>. Hence, it is said that their fathers who "came after," that is, after the generation when the tabernacle was built. The Greek, however, here means, properly, "which also our fathers, having "received," brought," etc. The sense is not materially different. Stephen means that it was not brought in by that generation, but by the next.<p>With Jesus - This should have been rendered "with Joshua." Jesus is the Greek mode of writing the name "Joshua." But the Hebrew name should by all means have been retained here, as also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm">Hebrews 4:8</a>.<p>Into the possession of the Gentiles - Into the land possessed by the Gentiles, that is, into the promised land then occupied by the Canaanites, etc.<p>Whom God ... - That is, he continued to drive them out until the time of David, when they were completely expelled. Or it may mean that the tabernacle was in the possession of the Jews, and was the appointed place of worship, until the time of David, who desired to build him a temple. The Greek is ambiguous. The "connection" favors the latter interpretation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45. which &#8230; our fathers that came after&#8212;rather, "having received it by succession" (Margin), that is, the custody of the tabernacle from their ancestors.<p>brought in with Jesus&#8212;or Joshua.<p>into the possession&#8212;rather, "at the taking possession of [the territory of] the Gentiles."<p>unto the days of David&#8212;for till then Jerusalem continued in the hands of the Jebusites. But Stephen's object in mentioning David is to hasten from the tabernacle which he set up, to the temple which his son built, in Jerusalem; and this only to show, from their own Scripture (Isa 66:1, 2), that even that temple, magnificent though it was, was not the proper resting-place of Jehovah upon earth; as his audience and the nations had all along been prone to imagine. (What that resting-place was, even "the contrite heart, that trembleth at God's word," he leaves to be gathered from the prophet referred to).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Jesus, </span> or Joshua, it being the same name, as appears also, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-8.htm" title="For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward have spoken of another day.">Hebrews 4:8</a></span>, only Jesus is more according to the Greek use: Joshua was a type of Jesus, and agreed with him in his name, and in the reason of his name; he having also saved the people, and brought them into the promised rest; yet the difference is as great between them as betwixt the heavenly Canaan and the earthly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Before the face of our fathers; </span> they were not able to look upon an Israelite, whilst God was for them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Which also our fathers that came after,....

The language on the "Tingitane", or Hercules's pillars, said to be set up by some of these Canaanites, agrees with this, on which they inscribed these words; <p>"we are they who fled from the face of Joshua the robber, the son of Nave,'' <p>or Nun: <p>unto the days of David; this clause must not be read in connection with the words immediately preceding, as if the sense was, that the inhabitants of Canaan were drove out of their land unto the times of David, and then returned and resettled, as in the Ethiopic version; but with the beginning of the verse, and the meaning is, that the tabernacle which the Israelites received from their fathers, and brought into the land of Canaan with them, was there unto the times of David. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which also our fathers that came after <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> brought in with Jesus into the <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> possession of the Gentiles, whom God drave out <span class="cverse3">{u}</span> before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;</span><p>(s) Delivered from hand to hand.<p>(t) This is said using the figure of speech metonymy, and refers to the countries which the Gentiles possessed.<p>(u) God drove them out that they should yield up the possession of those countries to our fathers when they entered into the land.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-45.htm" title="Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, to the days of David;">Acts 7:45</a>. <span class="ital">Which also our fathers with Joshua</span> (in connection with Joshua, under whose guidance they stood), <span class="ital">after having received it</span> (from Moses), <span class="ital">brought in</span> (to Canaan). <span class="greekheb">διαδέχεσθαι</span> (only here in the N.
