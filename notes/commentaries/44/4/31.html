The disciples felt the power of the Spirit, the evidence of sense confirming that of inward, spiritual consciousness, and it came in the form for which they had made a special supplication, the power to speak with boldness the word which they were commissioned to speak.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:23-31 Christ's followers do best in company, provided it is their own company. It encourages God's servants, both in doing work, and suffering work, that they serve the God who made all things, and therefore has the disposal of all events; and the Scriptures must be fulfilled. Jesus was anointed to be a Saviour, therefore it was determined he should be a sacrifice, to make atonement for sin. But sin is not the less evil for God's bringing good out of it. In threatening times, our care should not be so much that troubles may be prevented, as that we may go on with cheerfulness and courage in our work and duty. They do not pray, Lord let us go away from our work, now that it is become dangerous, but, Lord, give us thy grace to go on stedfastly in our work, and not to fear the face of man. Those who desire Divine aid and encouragement, may depend upon having them, and they ought to go forth, and go on, in the strength of the Lord God. God gave a sign of acceptance of their prayers. The place was shaken, that their faith might be established and unshaken. God gave them greater degrees of his Spirit; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, more than ever; by which they were not only encouraged, but enabled to speak the word of God with boldness. When they find the Lord God help them by his Spirit, they know they shall not be confounded, Isa 1.7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they had prayed - The event which followed was regarded by them as an evidence that God heard their prayer.<p>The place was shaken - The word which is translated "was shaken" commonly denotes "violent agitation," as the raging of the sea, the convulsion of an earthquake, or trees shaken by the wind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-7.htm">Matthew 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-26.htm">Acts 16:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-26.htm">Hebrews 12:26</a>. The language here is suited to express the idea of an earthquake. Whether the motion was confined to the house where they were is not said. They probably regarded this as an answer to their prayer, or as an evidence that God would be with them:<p>(1) Because it was sudden and violent, and was not produced by any natural causes;<p>(2) Because it occurred immediately, while they were seeking divine direction;<p>(3) Because it was an exhibition of great power, and was an evidence that God could protect them; and,<p>(4) Because a convulsion so great, sudden, and mighty was suited at that time to awe them with a proof of the presence and power of God. A similar instance of an answer to prayer by an earthquake is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-25.htm">Acts 16:25-26</a>. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm">Acts 2:1-2</a>. It may be added, that among the Jews an earthquake was very properly regarded as a striking and impressive proof of the presence of Yahweh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-6.htm">Isaiah 29:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>, "The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of God; even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the God of Israel."

Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a>. Among the pagan, an earthquake was regarded as proof of the presence and favor of the Deity.

In the Acts it is plainly regarded as no chance occurrence, and with regard to the rationalistic hypothesis that it was merely a natural event, accidentally coinciding with the conclusion of the prayer, Zeller admits that there is every probability against the truth of any such hypothesis; rather may we see in it with St. Chrysostom a direct answer to the appeal to the God in whose hands were the heaven and the earth (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Iren., <span class="ital">Adv. Haer.</span>, iii., 12, 5). “The place was shaken, and that made them all the more unshaken” (Chrysostom, Theophylact, Oecumenius).—<span class="greekheb">συνηγμένοι</span>, “were gathered,” so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-27.htm" title="For of a truth against your holy child Jesus, whom you have anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together,">Acts 4:27</a>; the aorist in the former verse referring to an act, but here the perfect to a state, but impossible to distinguish in translation, Burton, <span class="ital">N.

(aorist), the prayer was immediately answered by their being filled with the Holy Ghost, and they proceeded to speak, the imperfect also implying that they continued to speak (Rendall); there is no need to see any reference to the speaking with tongues. Feine sees in the narrative a divine answer to the Apostles’ prayer, so that filled with the Holy Ghost they spoke with boldness. And he adds, that such divine power must have been actually working in the Apostles, otherwise the growth of the Church in spite of its opposition is inexplicable—a remark which might well be considered by the deniers of a miraculous Christianity. It is in reality the same argument so forcibly put by St. Chrysostom: “If you deny miracles, you make it all the more marvellous that they should obtain such moral victories—these illiterate men!” Jüngst refers the whole verse to a redactor, recording that there was no one present with reference to whom the <span class="greekheb">παρρησία</span> could be employed.
