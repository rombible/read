As in the narrative of the feeding of the five thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-21.htm" title="And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside women and children.">Matthew 14:21</a>), women and children were not included. The number was probably ascertained, as on that occasion, by grouping those who came to baptism and to the breaking of bread by hundreds and by fifties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-40.htm" title="And they sat down in ranks, by hundreds, and by fifties.">Mark 6:40</a>). The connection in which the number is given makes it probable that it represents those who, under the influence of the impression made by the healing of the cripple and by St. Peter’s speech, attended the meetings of the Church that evening. The coincidence of the numbers in the two narratives could scarcely fail to lead the disciples to connect the one with the other, and to feel, as they broke the bread and blessed it, that they were also giving men the true bread from heaven.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-4.htm" title="However, many of them which heard the word believed; and the number of the men was about five thousand.">Acts 4:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Howbeit, many of them which heard the word believed </span>— For though the preachers were persecuted, the word prevailed. Thus the suffering days of the church have often been her growing days. <span class="ital">And the number of the men, </span>besides women and children, was <span class="ital">about five thousand</span> — “The assembly that owned Christianity was increased to above five thousand, and that success grieved the malignants.” — Baxter. Dr. Benson supposes that five thousand were converted on this occasion, besides the three thousand mentioned before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>. Had it been said, as there, that so many were <span class="ital">added to the church, </span>it would have determined the sense to be as he and some others understand it; but the use of the word<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εγενηθη</span>, <span class="ital">became, </span>favours the interpretation, that the whole number, including those who had been converted before, now became about five thousand. It is hardly to be thought (unless it were expressly asserted) that another day should be so much more remarkable for its number of converts than that on which the Spirit descended. However, supposing only two thousand were now converted, it is a glorious proof of the truth of Christianity, and no example can be given of the philosophers, or any other teachers, succeeding so gloriously in making converts to such holy and self-denying doctrines.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-4 The apostles preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead. It includes all the happiness of the future state; this they preached through Jesus Christ, to be had through him only. Miserable is their case, to whom the glory of Christ's kingdom is a grief; for since the glory of that kingdom is everlasting, their grief will be everlasting also. The harmless and useful servants of Christ, like the apostles, have often been troubled for their work of faith and labour of love, when wicked men have escaped. And to this day instances are not wanting, in which reading the Scriptures, social prayer, and religious conversation meet with frowns and checks. But if we obey the precepts of Christ, he will support us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Howbeit - But; notwithstanding.<p>Many of them ... - This was one of the instances, which has since been so often repeated, in which persecution is seen to have a tendency to extend and establish the faith which it was designed to destroy. It finally came to be a proverb that "the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church"; and there is no lesson which men have been so slow to learn as that to oppose and persecute men is the very way to confirm them in their opinions and to spread their doctrines. It was supposed here that the disciples were few; that they were without power, wealth, and influence; and that it was easy to crush them at once. But God made their persecution the means of extending, in a signal manner, the truths of the gospel and the triumphs of his word. And so in all ages it has been, and so it ever will be.<p>And the number ... - It seems probable that in this number of 5,000 there were included the 120 persons who are mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15</a>, and the 3,000 people who were converted on the day of Pentecost, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm">Acts 2:41</a>. It does not appear probable that 5,000 would have been assembled and converted in Solomon's porch <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11</a> on occasion of the cure of the lame man. Luke doubtless means to say that, up to this time, the number of persons who had joined themselves to the apostles was about 5,000. On this supposition, the work of religion must have made a very rapid advance. How long this was after the day of Pentecost is not mentioned, but it is clear that it was at no very distant period; and the accession of near two thousand to the number of believers was a very striking proof of the power and presence of the Holy Spirit.<p>Of the men - Of the "persons."

As a contrast to this treatment of the apostles (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>), Luke notices the great increase of the church, which was effected by the address of the apostle. The number of believers had before this been above three thousand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-41.htm" title="Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the same day there were added to them about three thousand souls.">Acts 2:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people.

St. Luke does not say that five thousand of St. Peter’s hearers were converted, in addition to those already converted at Pentecost (although Dr. Hort, following Chrys., Aug[149], Jer[150], takes this view, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 47), or that five thousand were added, but his words certainly mark the growing expansion of the Church in spite of threatening danger, as this is also evident on the view that five thousand represent the total number of believers. The instances above from the Gospels are generally quoted to confirm the view here taken, but Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, curiously quotes the same passages in proof that <span class="greekheb">ἀνδρῶν</span> here includes women.
