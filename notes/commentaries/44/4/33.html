This was the blessed fruit of Christ's dying precept to his disciples, and his dying prayer for them. Thus it was then, and it will be so again, when the Spirit shall be poured upon us from on high. The doctrine preached was the resurrection of Christ; a matter of fact, which being duly explained, was a summary of all the duties, privileges, and comforts of Christians. There were evident fruits of Christ's grace in all they said and did. They were dead to this world. This was a great evidence of the grace of God in them. They did not take away others' property, but they were indifferent to it. They did not call it their own; because they had, in affection, forsaken all for Christ, and were expecting to be stripped of all for cleaving to him. No marvel that they were of one heart and soul, when they sat so loose to the wealth of this world. In effect, they had all things common; for there was not any among them who lacked, care was taken for their supply. The money was laid at the apostles' feet. Great care ought to be taken in the distribution of public charity, that it be given to such as have need, such as are not able to procure a maintenance for themselves; those who are reduced to want for well-doing, and for the testimony of a good conscience, ought to be provided for. Here is one in particular mentioned, remarkable for this generous charity; it was Barnabas. As one designed to be a preacher of the gospel, he disentangled himself from the affairs of this life. When such dispositions prevail, and are exercised according to the circumstances of the times, the testimony will have very great power upon others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And with great power - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-8.htm">Acts 1:8</a>. The word "power" here denotes "efficacy," and means that they had "ability" given them to bear witness of the resurrection of the Saviour. it refers, therefore, I rather to their preaching than to their miracles.<p>Gave the apostles witness - The apostles bore testimony to.<p>The resurrection of the Lord Jesus - This was the main point to be established. If it proved that the Lord Jesus came to life again after having been put to death, it established all that he taught, and was a demonstration that he was sent from God. They exerted, therefore, all their powers to prove this, and their success was such as might have been expected. Multitudes were converted to the Christian faith.<p>And great grace ... - The word "grace" means "favor." See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm">John 1:16</a>. The expression here may mean either that the favor of God was remarkably shown to them, or that they had great favor in the sight of the people. It does not refer, as the expression now does commonly, to the internal blessings of religion on a man's own soul, to their personal advancement in the Christian graces, but to the favor or success that attended their preaching. The meaning probably is, that the "favor" of the "people" toward them was great, or that great success attended their ministry among them. Thus, the same word grace (Greek) is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>. If this is its meaning, then here is an instance of the power of the testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus to impress the minds of people. But this is not all, nor probably is it the main idea. It is that their union, their benevolence their liberality in supplying the needs of the needy, was a means of opening the hearts of the people, and of winning them to the Saviour. If we wish to incline others to our opinions, nothing is better adapted to it than to show them kindness, and even to minister to their temporal needs.<p>Benevolence toward them softens the heart, and inclines them to listen to us. It disarms their prejudices, and disposes them to the exercise of the mild and amiable feelings of religion. Hence, our Saviour was engaged in healing the diseases and supplying the needs of the people. He drew around him the poor, the needy, and the diseased, and supplied their necessities, and thus prepared them to receive his message of truth. Thus, God is love, and is constantly doing good, that his goodness may lead people to repentance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>. And hence, no persons have better opportunities to spread the true sentiments of religion, or are clothed with higher responsibilites, than those who have it in their power to do good, or than those who are habitually engaged in bestowing favors. Thus, physicians have access to the hearts of people which other persons have not. Thus, parents have an easy access to the minds of children. for they are constantly doing them good. And thus Sunday-school teachers, whose whole work is a work of benevolence, have direct and most efficient access to the hearts of the children committed to their care. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. with great power&#8212;effect on men's minds.<p>great grace was upon them all&#8212;The grace of God copiously rested on the whole community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With great power; </span> by sundry miracles which they wrought, as also by their boldness with which they spake; it being no small wonder to see and hear such illiterate men testifying the truths of the gospel amidst so many learned rabbins. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The resurrection</span> was the greatest point in controversy, which being granted, all things concerning Christ and the gospel could not be denied; and therefore here it is especially mentioned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Great grace; </span> favour and acceptation; men could not but think well of their doctrine and ways, whom they saw so innocent and holy, meek and good; especially God’s grace was manifest in their words and actions. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And with great power,....
