It was mystically the token of a complete ratification of the truth proclaimed. It reminded him of the three fold command, “Feed My sheep,” and taught him to take a wider range of work in obeying it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these?

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This was done thrice - Three times, doubtless to impress the mind of Peter with the certainty and importance of the vision.

That is, either the voice spoke the same words three times, or the sheet was let down three times; and it may be both; it may be, that every time the voice was spoke, the sheet was let down: this was done, not with respect to any mystical meaning in the number three, but for the confirmation of Peter, that he might be the more firmly assured of the truth of the things represented unto him: <p>and the vessel was received up again into heaven; to denote, that when the general assembly and church of the firstborn, whose names are written in heaven, whether Jews or Gentiles, are all gathered in, by the preaching of the Gospel to them, they will be taken up to heaven, their original and native place, and be for ever with the Lord; as well as to certify to Peter, that what was now shown him on earth, concerning the taking away the distinction of men and meats, was ratified in heaven. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-16.htm" title="This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.">Acts 10:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>: if we read <span class="greekheb">εὐθύς</span>, see critical notes, we have St. Mark’s characteristic word (used by St. Luke only here in Acts, and once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-49.htm" title="But he that hears, and does not, is like a man that without a foundation built an house on the earth; against which the stream did beat vehemently, and immediately it fell; and the ruin of that house was great.">Luke 6:49</a>), a suggestive fact in a section of the book in which the pen or the language of St. Peter may fairly be traced.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">This was done thrice</span>] The original has a conjunction “And” at the commencement of the sentence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The repetition of the vision three times over was made that no doubt might remain in the Apostle’s mind, and the reception of the whole into heaven again was designed to point out that it was a lesson which God had as directly sent as of old He sent the Law on Sinai.
