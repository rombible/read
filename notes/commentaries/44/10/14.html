To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have never eaten ... - In the Old Testament God had made a distinction between clean and unclean animals. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-2.htm">Leviticus 11:2-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-3.htm">Deuteronomy 14:3-20</a>. This law remained in the Scriptures, and Peter pled that he had never violated it, implying that he could not now violate it, as it was a law of God, and that, as it was unrepealed, he did not dare to act in a different manner from what it required. Between that law and the command which he now received in the vision there was an apparent variation, and Peter naturally referred to the well known and admitted written Law. One design of the vision was to show him that that Law was now to pass away.<p>That is common - This word properly denotes "what pertains to all," but among the Jews, who were bound by special laws, and who were prohibited from many things that were freely indulged in by other nations, the word "common" came to be opposed to the word "sacred," and to denote what was in common use among the pagans, hence, that which was "profane," or "polluted." Here it means the same as "profane," or "forbidden."<p>Unclean - Ceremonially unclean; that is, what is forbidden by the ceremonial law of Moses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14.

Others make some difference; and by things common, understand all sorts of creatures, which were forbidden to the Jews, but were commonly fed upon by all nations round about them; and by things unclean, they understand such as by accident became so, as when any of the creatures permitted for use was strangled. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Peter said, not so, Lord,....

But in what relation does the <span class="greekheb">ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἐκαθάρισε</span> stand to the likewise divine institution of the Levitical laws about food? This is not answered by reference to “the effected and accomplished redemption, which is regarded as a restitution of the whole creation” (Olshausen), for this restoration is only promised for the world-period commencing with the Parousia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-20.htm" title="And he shall send Jesus Christ, which before was preached to you:">Acts 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm" title="For the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God.">Romans 8:19</a> ff.); but rather by pointing out that the institution of those laws of food was destined only for the duration of the old theocracy. They were a divine institution for the particular people of God, with a view to separate them from the nations of the world; their abolition could not therefore but be willed by God, when the time was fully come at which the idea of the theocracy was to be realized through Christ in the whole of humanity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-35.htm" title="But in every nation he that fears him, and works righteousness, is accepted with him.">Acts 10:35</a>; Romans 3.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm" title="And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, and one shepherd.">John 10:16</a>).

All persons who were not Jews were viewed as the “common” rabble, shut out from God’s covenant, then whatever practices of these outcasts differed from those of the chosen people were called “common” things, and as these “common” things were those forbidden by the Law, all such prohibited things or actions became known as “common.” Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-2.htm" title="And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is to say, with unwashed, hands, they found fault.">Mark 7:2</a>, where the margin explains that “<span class="ital">defiled</span> hands” is in the original “<span class="ital">common</span> hands.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-14.htm" title="But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.">Acts 10:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μηδαμῶς</span>, <span class="ital">by no means</span>) A trance leaves a man liberty in respect to that particular thing which is vividly set before him: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-19.htm" title="And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you:">Acts 22:19</a>.
