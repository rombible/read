Those who came with Peter were apparently not sharers at the time in the exultant joy which they were yet compelled to recognise as the Spirit’s work. They listened with amazement as they heard the rapturous chant burst from the lips of the as yet unbaptised heathens. Here, accordingly, was one definite fulfilment of Peter’s vision. Those who so spake had been, as it were, carried up into heaven, as the four-footed beasts and creeping things had been, and so a proof was given that no man might henceforth call them common or unclean. Peter himself had indeed learnt that lesson so fully (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.">Acts 10:28</a>) as not to need this special attestation, but for those who came with him this evidence was needed and was sufficient.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:44-48 The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, to confirm them in the faith; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized, to show that God does not confine himself to outward signs. The Holy Ghost fell upon those who were neither circumcised nor baptized; it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. They magnified God, and spake of Christ and the benefits of redemption. Whatever gift we are endued with, we ought to honour God with it. The believing Jews who were present, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also. By mistaken notions of things, we make difficult for ourselves as to the methods of Divine providence and grace. As they were undeniably baptized with the Holy Ghost, Peter concluded they were not to be refused the baptism of water, and the ordinance was administered. The argument is conclusive; can we deny the sign to those who have received the things signified? Those who have some acquaintance with Christ, cannot but desire more. Even those who have received the Holy Ghost, must see their need of daily learning more of the truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they of the circumcision - Who had been Jews.<p>Were astonished - Were amazed that Gentiles should be admitted to the same favor as themselves. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45. they of the circumcision &#8230; were astonished &#8230; because that on the Gentiles also was poured out, &c.&#8212;without circumcision.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They of the circumcision; </span> such as were not only themselves circumcised, but born of circumcised parents, who are thus called, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a></span>.

They own, that before the giving of the law, the Holy Ghost was among the Gentiles, but from that time ceased to be among them (r): hence even these believing Jews wonder at the pouring it forth upon them; which they needed not, had they known that the legal dispensation was now at an end, and the Gospel dispensation had taken place; in which it had been foretold the Spirit should be poured forth on the dry ground of the Gentiles. <p>(o) Zohar in Gen. fol. 118. 4. &amp; in Exod. fol. 2. 3. &amp; 70. 2.

Now if, in the bare <span class="greekheb">γλώσσαις λαλεῖν</span>, this <span class="greekheb">γλώσσαις</span> were to be understood in the same sense as in chap. 2. according to the representation of the narrator, then—as Bleek’s conception, “to speak in glosses,” is decidedly to be rejected (see on chap. 2)—no other meaning would result than: “to speak in languages,” <span class="ital">i.e. to speak in foreign languages</span> (different from their mother tongue), and therefore quite the same as <span class="greekheb">ἑτέραις γλώσσαις λαλεῖς</span>. But against this we may decisively urge the very expression <span class="greekheb">ἑτέραις</span> (with which agrees <span class="greekheb">καιναῖς</span> in the apocryphal passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-17.htm" title="And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues;">Mark 16:17</a>) only added in chap. 2, and almost ostentatiously glorified as the chief matter, but <span class="ital">not</span> inserted at all elsewhere (here or at chap. 19 or 1 Corinthians 12-14).
