For a time he was to walk, as it were, blindfold, but trusting in the full assurance of faith in the Hand that was guiding him. As once before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-7.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.">John 13:7</a>), he knew not yet what his Lord was doing, but was to know hereafter. He and the messengers from Cornelius were alike acting on the promptings of the Divine Spirit.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Spirit - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>.

Moreover these six brothers accompanied me, and we entered into the man's house:">Acts 11:12</a>, it is active, and signifies “making no distinction,” i.e. between Jew and Gentile. The latter was used by the Apostle when events had taught him precisely what the vision and the spiritual exhortation meant. The Spirit’s teaching is given little by little as Christ had told His disciples that it should be, “He shall <span class="ital">guide</span> you (lit. lead you on the way) unto all truth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-13.htm" title="However, when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come.">John 16:13</a>). The vision had given no hint of a journey to be taken; now Peter is informed of it, and so too when the end of the journey is reached the “nothing wavering” is shewn to mean “putting no distinction between Jews and other men,” and thus the vision was made intelligible little by little and the perplexity removed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-20.htm" title="Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.">Acts 10:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μηδὲν διακρινόμενος</span>, <span class="ital">nothing doubting</span>) A requisite in the highest decree necessary in the case of a good action.

Here, too, we may notice the working of God's providence, under whose direction Peter's thoughts and Cornelius's message meet at the same point, like men working from opposite ends of a tunnel and meeting at the same spot. </body></html>
