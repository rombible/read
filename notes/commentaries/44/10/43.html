This was the answer to their doubts and perplexities. Not by submitting themselves to the bondage of the Law, not by circumcision and all that it implied, but by the simple act of faith in Christ, and in the power of His Name, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>of all the attributes and energies of which the Name was the symbol, they, Gentiles as they were, might receive that remission of sins which conscience, now roused to its full activity, taught them was the indispensable condition of acceptance and of peace. The intensity of that emotion, the satisfaction of all their previous yearnings, placed them subjectively in a spiritual condition which prepared the way for the wonder which the next verse narrates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-43.htm" title="To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whoever believes in him shall receive remission of sins.">Acts 10:43</a></span>. <span class="ital">To him give all the prophets witness — </span>Speaking to heathen, he does not mention the name of any one prophet in particular; but, after having spoken of Christ’s person, miracles, and resurrection, contents himself with informing them, in general terms, that there were many prophets in former ages who bore testimony to him, without entering into a particular enumeration of them, or quoting their predictions: an observation which is also applicable to that particular truth which Peter here declares the prophets, which he referred to, had attested, namely, <span class="ital">that through his name </span>— Through his mediation, grace, and Spirit; <span class="ital">whosoever believeth in him </span>— With a living faith, whether he be Jew or Gentile; <span class="ital">shall receive remission of sins </span>— Though he had not before either feared God or wrought righteousness. This truth it would have been easy for the apostle to have proved, from several testimonies of the prophets, (had it been proper to do so to that audience,) as will appear by comparing the passages referred to in the margin. We may further observe here, that we do not read of Peter’s working any miracle on this great occasion, in proof of the truth of his doctrine; as the preceding testimony of the angel to Cornelius, and the descent of the Holy Spirit in his miraculous gifts, while he was speaking to them, were sufficient proofs, both of the truth of the gospel, and of Peter’s being an authorized interpreter of it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:34-43 Acceptance cannot be obtained on any other ground than that of the covenant of mercy, through the atonement of Christ; but wherever true religion is found, God will accept it without regarding names or sects. The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To him give ... - See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-27.htm">Luke 24:27</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-44.htm">Luke 24:44</a>.<p>That through his name ... - This was implied in what the prophets said.

Christ was set forth in the purposes of God, in the types, figures, and sacrifices of the law, and in the promises and prophecies of the Old Testament, as he that should obtain the remission of sins by his blood, without which there is no remission; he came in the fulness of time, and shed his blood for this purpose, and accordingly it is procured by it; and this is published in the everlasting Gospel, that whoever believes in Christ, not with an historical or temporary faith, or in profession only, but with the faith of God's elect, which is the gift of God, and the operation of his Spirit, which works by love, and makes Christ precious, shall receive it as a free gift; for it is not to be purchased by money, nor obtained by works of righteousness, nor procured by repentance, or by anything done by the creature, but is according to the riches of divine grace and mercy: through the name of Christ: through the blood of Christ, which was shed for it; through the power of Christ, as God, who is able to forgive it; and through the hands of Christ, as Mediator, who is exalted to bestow it; and for the sake of Christ, and his mediation, whose blood calls aloud for it; and whoever looks by faith to him for it, shall have it, of whatsoever sex, state, or condition they be, of whatsoever people or nation, and how great sinners soever they have been, and whether they are weak or strong believers.

The appropriate degree of receptivity was there; and so, for a special divine purpose, the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> communicated itself <span class="ital">according to the free will of God even before</span> baptism.[261] Olshausen thinks that this extraordinary circumstance took place <span class="ital">for the sake of Peter</span>, in order to make him aware, beyond a doubt, in this first decisive instance, that the Gentiles would not be excluded from the gift of the Spirit. But Peter had this illumination already (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a> f.); and besides, this object would have been fully attained by the outpouring of the Spirit <span class="ital">after baptism</span>. We may add that the quite extraordinary and, in fact, unique nature of the case stands decidedly opposed to the abuse of the passage by the Baptists.[262]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[261] “Liberum gratia habet ordinem,” Bengel. Not the <span class="ital">necessity</span>, but the <span class="ital">possibility</span> of the bestowal of the Spirit before baptism, was implied by the susceptibility which had already emerged. The <span class="ital">design</span> of this extraordinary effusion of the Spirit is, according to ver. 45, to be found in this, that all scruples concerning the reception of the Gentiles were to be taken away from the Jewish-Christians who were present in addition to Peter, and thereby from the Christians generally. What Peter had just said: <span class="greekheb">πάντα τὸν πιστεύοντα εἰς αὐτόν</span>, was at once divinely affirmed and sealed by this <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> in such a way that now no doubt at all could remain concerning the immediate admissibility of baptism. Chrysostom strikingly calls this event the <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογίαν μεγάλην</span>, which God had arranged beforehand for Peter. That it could not but, at the same time, form for the latter himself the divine confirmation of the revelation already imparted to him, is obvious of itself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[262] Comp.
