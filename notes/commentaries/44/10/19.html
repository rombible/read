And when thou comest to compare their message with what thou hast now seen, thou wilt easily know the intent of this vision, and the use thou art to make of it for thine own direction. How gradually was Peter prepared to receive this new admonition of the Spirit! Thus God is wont to lead on his children by degrees, always giving them light for the present hour. <span class="ital">Then Peter went down to the men </span>— Instantly, before any message from them could reach him. <span class="ital">And said </span>— To them, while they continued at the door; <span class="ital">Behold, I am he whom you seek </span>— The person you inquire for; <span class="ital">what is the cause wherefore ye are come? </span>— Peter, not perfectly knowing yet whither all this tended, makes the more exact inquiry. <span class="ital">And they said, Cornelius, </span>&c. — Endeavouring to prevent any prejudice which Peter might have against Cornelius, on account of his being a Gentile, they inform him: 1st, That he was a just, or righteous, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/prayer_of_manasseh/1-2.htm" title="that hast made the heaven and the earth with all their adornment;">Man 1:2</a> d, That he worshipped the true God, the God whom the Jews worshipped, and not the false gods of the Gentiles. 3d, That he was of good report even among the Jews; was reputed by them a pious and good man; so that it would be no disparagement to him to go to him. And, 4th, What must have been an irresistible argument with Peter, that he had been warned by an angel to send for him to his house. When God’s command is evident, his true people do not hesitate to obey.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Spirit - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm">Acts 8:29</a>.
