Pure and undefiled religion is sometimes found where we least expect it. Wherever the fear of God rules in the heart, it will appear both in works of charity and of piety, neither will excuse from the other. Doubtless Cornelius had true faith in God's word, as far as he understood it, though not as yet clear faith in Christ. This was the work of the Spirit of God, through the mediation of Jesus, even before Cornelius knew him, as is the case with us all when we, who before were dead in sin, are made alive. Through Christ also his prayers and alms were accepted, which otherwise would have been rejected. Without dispute or delay Cornelius was obedient to the heavenly vision. In the affairs of our souls, let us not lose time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when ... - "It has been remarked that from Joppa, Jonah was sent to preach to the Gentiles at Nineveh, and that from the same place Peter was sent to preach to the Gentiles at Caesarea" (Clarke). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7, 8. when the angel &#8230; was departed, he called&#8212;immediately doing as directed, and thereby showing the simplicity of his faith.<p>a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually&#8212;of the "soldiers under him," such as the centurion at Capernaum had (Mt 8:9). Who this "devout soldier" was, can only be matter of conjecture. Da Costa [Four Witnesses] gives a number of ingenious reasons for thinking that, having attached himself henceforth to Peter&#8212;whose influence in the composition of the second Gospel is attested by the earliest tradition, and is stamped on that Gospel itself&#8212;he is no other than the Evangelist Mark.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thus on Cornelius’s side all things are disposed towards his receiving of the gospel; and the same providence, at the same time, disposes all things on Peter’s part towards his coming to publish it: for, .<span class="ital">{ see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a></span>}</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when he had declared all these things unto them,....

So that it may be they did not set out till early the next morning, as seems from the following verse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he had declared all these things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-8.htm" title="And when he had declared all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.">Acts 10:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐξηγησάμενος ἅπαντα</span>: only in Luke in N.T., except once in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-35.htm" title="And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known of them in breaking of bread.">Luke 24:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-12.htm" title="Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had worked among the Gentiles by them.">Acts 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-19.htm" title="And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had worked among the Gentiles by his ministry.">Acts 21:19</a>, and in LXX, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm" title="And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a dream to his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and, see, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of Midian, and came to a tent, and smote it that it fell, and overturned it, that the tent lay along.">Jdg 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-24.htm" title="Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvelous works among all nations.">1 Chronicles 16:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-5.htm" title="And it came to pass, as he was telling the king how he had restored a dead body to life, that, behold, the woman, whose son he had restored to life, cried to the king for her house and for her land.
