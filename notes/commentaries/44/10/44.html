Now, as then, the “tongues” manifested themselves, not as instruments of teaching, but in “magnifying God.” As there is no mention here of the utterance of praise being in any other language than those with which the speakers were familiar, there is no ground for assuming that this feature of the Pentecostal gift was reproduced, and the jubilant ecstatic praise which was the essence of that gift must be thought of as corresponding to the phenomena described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-7.htm" title="And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped?">1Corinthians 14:7-9</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word....">Acts 10:44-46</a></span>. <span class="ital">While Peter yet spake </span>— Or, <span class="ital">was yet speaking; these words</span> — Even before he had finished, and without the imposition of his hands on their heads; <span class="ital">the Holy Ghost fell </span>— On Cornelius, and <span class="ital">on all them which heard </span>— Or, <span class="ital">were hearing; the word </span>— Thus were they consecrated to God, as the first-fruits of the Gentiles: and thus did God give a clear and satisfactory evidence, that he had accepted them as well as the Jews. <span class="ital">And they of the circumcision </span>— The believing Jews; <span class="ital">as many as came with Peter </span>— On this important occasion; <span class="ital">were astonished </span>— At the fact; which, if they had not seen it, would to them have appeared incredible; <span class="ital">that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost </span>— For they had supposed that they could not have even been admitted into the Christian Church, much less have received such a blessing as the Holy Spirit in his gifts and graces, without submitting to circumcision, and so subjecting themselves to the observation of the whole Mosaic law. But now they saw it incontestably proved, that even those who were neither made converts to Judaism, nor circumcised, might be partakers with them in the highest privileges. <span class="ital">For they heard them speak with tongues </span>— Speak in divers languages, which they had never learned; <span class="ital">and magnify God </span>— In such exalted sentiments and terms, as abundantly proved that their thoughts as well as their expressions, their minds as well as their tongues, were immediately under a divine influence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:44-48 The Holy Ghost fell upon others after they were baptized, to confirm them in the faith; but upon these Gentiles before they were baptized, to show that God does not confine himself to outward signs. The Holy Ghost fell upon those who were neither circumcised nor baptized; it is the Spirit that quickeneth, the flesh profiteth nothing. They magnified God, and spake of Christ and the benefits of redemption. Whatever gift we are endued with, we ought to honour God with it. The believing Jews who were present, were astonished that the gift of the Holy Ghost was poured out upon the Gentiles also. By mistaken notions of things, we make difficult for ourselves as to the methods of Divine providence and grace. As they were undeniably baptized with the Holy Ghost, Peter concluded they were not to be refused the baptism of water, and the ordinance was administered. The argument is conclusive; can we deny the sign to those who have received the things signified? Those who have some acquaintance with Christ, cannot but desire more. Even those who have received the Holy Ghost, must see their need of daily learning more of the truth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Holy Ghost fell ... - Endowing them with the power of speaking with other tongues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm">Acts 10:46</a>. Of this the apostle Peter makes much in his argument in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm">Acts 11:17</a>. By this, God showed that the Gentiles were to be admitted to the same privileges with the Jews, and to the blessings of salvation in the same manner.

What wonderful efferts had this short sermon!

As he was thus discoursing concerning Christ, his person, his miracles, his death and resurrection, and the efficacy of his blood for pardon, before he had done speaking, <p>the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word. This is not to be understood of the operations of the Spirit of God upon the souls of men, under the ministry of the word; though true it is, that the Spirit of God attends the preaching of thee Gospel, and not only qualifies men for it, and assists them in it, but makes it effectual to many that hear it: hearers of the word lie in the way of the gracious operations of the Spirit; and the gifts and graces of the Spirit are given to persons, or the Spirit falls upon them under such means: which may denote the original of the grace of the Spirit, it falls down from above, from heaven; the freeness of it, it is bestowed on whom he pleases, under the same ministry; the suddenness of it, it comes at once, unthought of, and undesired, as well as undeserved; the power and efficacy of it, it falls with weight, it melts the heart, and converts the sinner; and the plenty of it, it falls in abundance, it is exceeding abundant with faith and love; and the permanency of it, it continues where it falls, and is a well of living water springing up unto everlasting life: and also the invisibility of it unto others. But this is not here intended, at least it is not only designed; for though the Spirit of God, in the operations of his grace, might fall upon them that heard the word, whereby they were regenerated, converted, and sanctified, and so became proper subjects for baptism; yet also the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit came upon them, as they were hearing; not upon the men, the believing Jews, that came along with Peter; but upon Cornelius and his family, and upon all his relations and friends, who came together to hear the word at his invitation, and now were hearing it; and as they were, the Holy Ghost, in his miraculous gifts of speaking with divers tongues, fell upon them in a visible form, as upon the apostles on the day of Pentecost; for that it was in the same way seems probable from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm">Acts 11:15</a>. These extraordinary gifts of the Spirit were necessary at the first preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles, for the confirmation of it: as well as for the further confirmation of Peter, that he was right in so doing; as also for the sake of the believing Jews he brought along with him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.</span><p>(8) The Spirit of God seals that in the heart of the hearers which the minister of the word speaks by the commandment of God, as is evident by the results.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/10.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔτι λ</span>.: the Apostle is apparently interrupted (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a>); but in this instance we can agree with Overbeck that the concluding phrase, in its relation to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:">Acts 10:34</a> and its proof that God was no respecter of persons, gives to the whole speech a perfect completeness (so Zöckler).—<span class="greekheb">ἐπέπεσε</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a>, and for the frequency of the word in Acts and its use in Luke’s Gospel, see Friedrich, p. 41. By this wonderful proof St. Peter and his Jewish brethren with him saw that, uncircumcised though they were, Cornelius and his household were no longer “common or unclean”: “The Holy Ghost,” said the Jews, “never fell upon a Gentile”.
