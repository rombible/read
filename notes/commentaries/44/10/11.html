Its inward meaning may fairly be thought of as corresponding to his prayer. One who looked out from Joppa upon the waters of the Great Sea towards the far-off Isles of the Gentiles, might well seek to know by what process and under what conditions those who dwelt in them would be brought within the fold of which he was one of the chief appointed shepherds. The place, we may add, could not fail to recall the memory of the great prophet who had taken ship from thence, and who was conspicuous alike as a preacher of a gospel of repentance to the Gentiles, and, in our Lord’s own teaching, as a type of the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40-41</a>).

To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And saw heaven opened - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>.

The visionary appearance has something marvellous even in the way of its occurrence.

What the Apostle saw was an extended sheet, the four corners of which were held up as it were by cords let down from the four extremities of the opened sky. The significance of the outstretched sheet, as a figure of the wide world, and the four corners as the directions into which the gospel was now to be borne forth into all the world, has often been dwelt upon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-11.htm" title="And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending on him, as it had been a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:">Acts 10:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν οὐρανὸν</span>, <span class="ital">the heaven</span>) The vessel was not only lifted up from the earth into heaven, but was first let down from heaven.

"We are to imagine the vessel, looking like a colossal four-cornered linen cloth letting itself down, while the corners attached to heaven to support the whole." The word is used in this sense by Herodotus, describing the sacrifices of the Scythians. The victim's forefeet are bound with a cord, "and the person who is about to offer, taking his station behind the victim, pulls the end (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)of the rope, and thereby throws the animal down" (iv., 60). The suggestion of ropes holding the corners of the sheet (Alford, and, cautiously, Farrar) is unwarranted by the usage of the word. It was the technical expression in medical language for the ends of bandages. The word for sheet in this passage was also the technical term for a bandage, as was the kindred word &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, used of the linen bandages in which the Lord's body was swathed.
