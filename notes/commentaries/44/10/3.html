And dare any man say, then, that these were only splendid sins? or that they were an abomination before God? And yet it is certain, in the Christian sense, Cornelius was then an unbeliever. He had not then faith in Christ. So certain it is, that every one who seeks faith in Christ, should seek it in prayer and doing good to all men. <span class="ital">And now </span>— Adds the angel, since God is about to give thee a very singular proof of his love, by discovering things to thee which it is of the highest importance thou shouldst know; <span class="ital">send, </span>therefore, <span class="ital">to Joppa, and call for one Simon, &c.; he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do </span>— Two things here are remarkable, and worthy of particular attention: 1st, Cornelius is influenced continually by the fear of God; from that principle he prays and gives alms; is religious himself, and maintains religion in his family. And all this he does in such a manner as to be accepted of God therein. Nevertheless, it is now necessary he should do something further; he must embrace the Christian religion, God having now established it among men. Not, he might do this if he pleased, and it would be an improvement of his religion; but, he must do it, his doing it is indispensably necessary to his acceptance with God for the future. He that had believed the promise of the Messiah, must now believe the performance of that promise. Now God having given a further record concerning his Son than what had been given in the Old Testament prophecies, he requires men to receive that record when it is brought to them; and unless they do so, neither their prayers nor their alms can any longer come up for a memorial before him. Prayers and alms are indeed still accepted from those that believe in God and fear him, if they have not an opportunity of knowing more. But with those to whom the gospel is preached, it is necessary, in order to the acceptance of their persons, prayers, and alms, that they should believe that Jesus is the Christ, and should confide in him alone for acceptance. 2d, Though Cornelius has now an angel from heaven talking to him, yet he must not receive the gospel of Christ from this angel, nor be told by him what he ought to do, but must send for Peter to inform him. As the former observation puts a remarkable honour upon the gospel, so doth this upon the gospel ministry. It was not to angels, but to saints, persons compassed about with infirmity, that this grace was given, <span class="ital">to preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, </span>that the excellence of the power might be of God, and the dignity of Christ’s institution supported. And as it was an honour to the apostle, that he must preach that which an angel might not, so it was a further honour, that an angel was despatched from heaven on purpose to order him to be sent for. Observe, reader, to bring a faithful minister and a willing people together, is a work worthy of an angel, and what, therefore, the greatest of men should be glad to be employed in.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-8 Hitherto none had been baptized into the Christian church but Jews, Samaritans, and those converts who had been circumcised and observed the ceremonial law; but now the Gentiles were to be called to partake all the privileges of God's people, without first becoming Jews. Pure and undefiled religion is sometimes found where we least expect it. Wherever the fear of God rules in the heart, it will appear both in works of charity and of piety, neither will excuse from the other. Doubtless Cornelius had true faith in God's word, as far as he understood it, though not as yet clear faith in Christ. This was the work of the Spirit of God, through the mediation of Jesus, even before Cornelius knew him, as is the case with us all when we, who before were dead in sin, are made alive. Through Christ also his prayers and alms were accepted, which otherwise would have been rejected. Without dispute or delay Cornelius was obedient to the heavenly vision. In the affairs of our souls, let us not lose time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He saw in a vision - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-10.htm">Acts 9:10</a>.<p>Evidently - Openly; manifestly.<p>About the ninth hour - About 3 o'clock p. m.

This angel was sent to signify to Cornelius that his alms were accepted by God as an evidence of his piety, and to direct him to send for Peter to instruct him in the way of salvation. The importance of the occasion - the introduction of the gospel to a Gentile, and hence, to the entire Gentile world - was probably the chief reason why an angel was commissioned to visit the Roman centurion.

Eichhorn rationalized the narrative to the effect that Cornelius, full of longing to become acquainted with the distinguished Peter now so near him, learned the place of his abode from a citizen of Joppa at Caesarea, and then during prayer felt a peculiar elevation of mind, by which, as if by an angel, his purpose of making Peter’s acquaintance was confirmed. This is opposed to the whole representation; with which also Ewald’s similar view fails to accord, that Cornelius, uncertain whether or not he should wish a closer acquaintance with Peter, had, “as if irradiated by a heavenly certainty and directed by an angelic voice,” firmly resolved to invite the apostle at once to visit him<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡσεὶ περὶ ὥρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐνάτ</span>.
