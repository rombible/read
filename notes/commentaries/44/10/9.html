The “hunger” mentioned in the next verse implies that up to that time he had partaken of no food, and makes it probable that it was one of the days, the second and fifth in the week, which the Pharisees and other devout Jews observed as fasts. The flat housetop of an Eastern house was commonly used for prayer and meditation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm" title="What I tell you in darkness, that speak you in light: and what you hear in the ear, that preach you on the housetops.">Matthew 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm" title="Let him which is on the housetop not come down to take any thing out of his house:">Matthew 24:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-31.htm" title="In that day, he which shall be on the housetop, and his stuff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.">Luke 17:31</a>), and in a city like Joppa, and a house like that of the tanner, was probably the only place accessible for such a purpose.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:...">Acts 10:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">On the morrow, as they went </span>— For they set out too late to reach the place that night; <span class="ital">Peter went up upon the house-top to pray </span>— It has often been observed, in the course of these notes, that the houses in Judea had flat roofs, on which people walked for the sake of taking the air, and where they conversed, meditated, and prayed. <span class="ital">About the sixth hour </span>— Besides the two stated hours of prayer, at the time of the morning and evening sacrifice the more devout among the Jews were used to set apart <span class="ital">a third, </span>and to retire for prayer at noon. Thus David, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm" title="Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.">Psalm 55:17</a>,) <span class="ital">Evening and morning and at noon will I pray. </span>And Daniel also <span class="ital">kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed. </span>Whether Peter was induced by this, or by some other reason, to retire for prayer at this time, it seems at least to have been customary, in the first ages of the Christian Church, to offer up their daily prayers at the third, the sixth, and the ninth hour. <span class="ital">And he became very hungry </span>— At the usual meal-time; or rather, his hunger now was supernatural, to prepare him for the trance and vision here mentioned; for the symbols in these extraordinary discoveries were generally suited to the state of the natural faculties. <span class="ital">And </span>he <span class="ital">would have eaten </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ηθελε γευσασθαι</span>, <span class="ital">would have taken some refreshment; but while they made ready, he fell into a trance </span>— Or <span class="ital">ecstasy, </span>as the word, <span class="greekheb">εκστασις</span>, signifies; namely, such a rapture of mind as gives the person who falls into it a look of astonishment, and renders him insensible of the external objects around him, while, in the mean time, his imagination is agitated in an extraordinary manner with some striking scenes which pass before it, and take up all his attention. In this ecstasy of Peter, a very remarkable and instructive vision was presented to him, by which the Lord prepared him for the service to which he was immediately to be called; but to which, without some such discovery of the divine will as was now made to him, he would have had an insuperable objection.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:9-18 The prejudices of Peter against the Gentiles, would have prevented his going to Cornelius, unless the Lord had prepared him for this service. To tell a Jew that God had directed those animals to be reckoned clean which were hitherto deemed unclean, was in effect saying, that the law of Moses was done away. Peter was soon made to know the meaning of it. God knows what services are before us, and how to prepare us; and we know the meaning of what he has taught us, when we find what occasion we have to make use of it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Peter went up ... - The small room in the second story, or on the roof of the house, was the usual place for retirement and prayer. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-6.htm">Matthew 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-2.htm">Matthew 9:2</a>. Even when there was no room constructed on the roof, the roof was a common resort for retirement and prayer. Around the edge a battlement or parapet was commonly made, within which a person could be quite retired from public view. "At Jaffa, the ancient Joppa," says Prof. Hackett (lllustrations of Scripture, p. 81), "where Peter was residing at the time of his vision on the house-top, I observed houses furnished with a wall around the roof, within which a person could sit or kneel without any exposure to the view of others, whether on the adjacent houses or in the streets. At Jerusalem I entered the house of a Jew early one morning, and found a member of the family, sitting secluded and alone on one of the lower roofs, engaged in reading the Scriptures and offering his prayers."<p>Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book, vol. i. p. 52) says of these roofs, "When surrounded with battlements, and shaded by vines trained over them, they afford a very agreeable retreat, even at the sixth hour of the day - the time when Peter was favored with that singular vision, by which the kingdom of heaven was thrown open to the Gentile world."<p>About the sixth hour - About twelve o'clock (at noon). The Jews had two stated seasons of prayer, morning and evening. But it is evident that the more pious of the Jews frequently added a third season of devotion, probably at noon. Thus, David says <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a>, "Evening and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud." Thus, Daniel "kneeled upon his knees three times a day and prayed," <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-13.htm">Daniel 6:13</a>. It was also customary in the early Christian church to offer prayer at the third, sixth, and ninth hours (Clem. Alex. as quoted by Doddridge). Christians will, however, have not merely stated seasons for prayer, but they will seize upon moments of leisure, and when their feelings strongly incline them to it, to pray. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-16. upon the housetop&#8212;the flat roof, the chosen place in the East for cool retirement.<p>the sixth hour&#8212;noon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These houses were flat on the tops, and therefore they were commanded to make battlements for them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-8.htm" title="When you build a new house, then you shall make a battlement for your roof, that you bring not blood on your house, if any man fall from there.">Deu 22:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, </span> that he might from thence view the temple, which was a type of Christ, through whom only we and our prayers can be acceptable unto God; hence, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-30.htm" title="And listen you to the supplication of your servant, and of your people Israel, when they shall pray toward this place: and hear you in heaven your dwelling place: and when you hear, forgive.">1 Kings 8:30</a></span>, &c., there is so often mention made of praying towards the city, and towards the place which God should choose; this Daniel practised, though upon the hazard of his life, when both city and temple were ruined, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm" title="Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem, he kneeled on his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.">Daniel 6:10</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sixth hour</span> with them is high noon, or midday, and is accounted one of the three times of prayer, <span class="ital">{see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a></span>}</span> and was, as the Jews say, recommended to them by Isaac; howsoever, it was the time when they might begin to prepare the evening sacrifice: none of these causes need to be assigned, for doubtless this blessed apostle did <span class="ital">watch unto prayer, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-7.htm" title="But the end of all things is at hand: be you therefore sober, and watch to prayer.">1 Peter 4:7</a></span>, and desirously laid hold upon all opportunities to pour out his soul unto God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>On the morrow, as they went on their journey,.... From Caesarea to Joppa; Joppa is said to be six and thirty miles distant from Caesarea; so far Caesarea was from Lydda, but it seems to be further from Joppa; for according to Josephus (b), from Joppa to Antipatris were a hundred and fifty furlongs, which are almost nineteen miles, and from thence to Caesarea were twenty six miles; unless there was a nearer way by the sea shore, as there was a way by that from Caesarea to Joppa, of which the above author makes mention (c); wherefore they must either have set out the evening before, or early that morning, to get to Joppa by the sixth hour, or twelve o'clock at noon; as it seems they did, by what follows: <p>and drew nigh unto the city; that is, of Joppa, were but a little way distant from it: <p>Peter went up upon the housetop to pray; the roofs of houses in Judea were flat, and persons might walk upon them, and hither they often retired for devotion and recreation; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-17.htm">Matthew 24:17</a>, it was on the former count, namely for prayer, that Peter went up thither, and that he might, be private and alone, and undisturbed in the discharge of that duty. This being at a tanner's house, though not in his shop, brings to mind a canon of the Jews (d), <p>"a man may not enter into a bath, nor into a tanner's shop, near the Minchah,'' <p>or time of prayer. Now this was about the sixth hour or twelve o'clock at noon, when Peter went up to pray; at which time the messengers from Cornelius were near the city of Joppa; this was another time of prayer used by the Jews, and is what they call the great Minchah, which began at the sixth hour and an half, and so was as is here said, about the sixth hour See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1</a>. <p>(b) Antiqu. l. 13. c. 13.
