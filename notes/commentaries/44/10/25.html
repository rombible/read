So Jairus had bowed down before Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm" title="While he spoke these things to them, behold, there came a certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even now dead: but come and lay your hand on her, and she shall live.">Matthew 9:18</a>), so St. John bowed before the angel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-8.htm" title="And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things.">Revelation 22:8</a>). Peter’s answer, in strong contrast with the words and acts, the very ceremonial, of those who claim to be his successors, shows that he looked on it as expressing a homage such as God alone could rightly claim. For man to require or receive it from man was an inversion of the true order, The language of the angel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-9.htm" title="Then said he to me, See you do it not: for I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers the prophets, and of them which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.">Revelation 22:9</a>—“See thou do it not: for I am thy fellow-servant . . . worship God”—implies the same truth. Both bear their witness, all the more important because not controversial, against any <span class= "ital">culius</span> of saints or angels that tends to efface the distinction between man and God. We must not pass over the parallelism between St. Peter’s words and those of St. Paul at Lystra, “We also are men of like passions with yourselves” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach to you that you should turn from these vanities to the living God, which made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein:">Acts 14:15</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-25.htm" title="And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him....">Acts 10:25-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">As Peter was coming in </span>— Cornelius, who had been expecting him, probably with some impatience, longing to know what that important doctrine was, which an angel had told him he should hear from him; <span class="ital">met him, and fell down at his feet </span>— Expressing thus his reverence for one, in so eminent a sense, the messenger of Heaven; <span class="ital">and worshipped him </span>— Not with divine, but mere civil worship: such as was usually paid to kings and princes, and others of high dignity, in the East. Having believed in the one living and true God, and forsaken the idolatry of the Gentiles, he certainly could not offer divine or religious worship to Peter: nor could he, as some have fancied, imagine Peter to be an angel, considering how the angel had spoken of him. But his reverence for him as a divine messenger, together with the custom which prevailed in those countries, of expressing the highest respect by prostration, might induce him to fall down at his feet, and offer a homage, which Peter wisely and religiously declined accepting. <span class="ital">And as he talked with him, he went in </span>— They went into the house talking together, probably of the goodness of God manifested in so happily bringing them together, for they could not but see and acknowledge God in it. <span class="ital">And found many that were come together </span>— More than Peter expected, which at once added solemnity to this service, and afforded a greater opportunity of doing good.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God! But these were ready to hear what Peter was commanded of God to say.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fell down at his feet - This was an act of profound regard for him as an ambassador of God. In Oriential countries it was usual for persons to prostrate themselves at length on the ground before men of rank and honor. "Worshipped him" This does not mean religious homage, but civil respect - the homage, or profound regard which was due to one in honor.

Worship is worthship, or honor paid to dignity or worth. This usage survives in the expressions worshipful and your worship. In the marriage-service of the English Church occurs the phrase, "With my body I thee worship." So Wycliffe renders <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-19.htm">Matthew 19:19</a>, "Worship thy father and thy mother;" and <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-26.htm">John 12:26</a>, "If any man serve me, my Father shall worship him." Here the meaning is that Cornelius paid reverence by prostrating himself after the usual oriental manner. </body></html>
