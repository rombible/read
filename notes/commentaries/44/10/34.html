St. James lays stress on that element of character, within the same limits, as essential to all who seek to be true disciples of the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-1.htm" title="My brothers, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory, with respect of persons.">James 2:1-7</a>). Both, however, needed to be taught that the same law of an impartial equity had a yet wider application, that the privileges and prerogatives of Israel, whatever blessings they might confer, were not to be set up as a barrier against the admission of other races to an equal fellowship in Christ. God had accepted the centurion. It remained for His servants to accept him also. It is instructive to note that St. Paul reproduces the same thought in nearly the same phrase (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm" title="For there is no respect of persons with God.">Romans 2:11</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-34.htm" title="Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:...">Acts 10:34-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then Peter opened his mouth — </span>Addressed himself to them, with a seriousness and solemnity answerable to so great an occasion; <span class="ital">and said, Of a truth I perceive </span>— More clearly than ever, from such a concurrence of circumstances; <span class="ital">that God is no respecter of persons </span>— Is not partial in his love. The words mean, 1st, That he does not confine his love to one nation; as the Jews were ready to suppose that he confined it to their nation. 2d, That he is loving to every man, and willeth that all men should be saved; <span class="ital">but in every nation he that feareth God, and worketh righteousness </span>— He that, 1st, Reverences God as infinitely great, glorious, wise, mighty, holy, just, and good; the cause, end, proprietor, and governor of all things: and, 2d, From this awful regard to him, not only avoids all known evil, but endeavours, according to the best light he has, to do all things well; <span class="ital">is accepted of him </span>— Through Christ, though he knows him not. The assertion is express, and admits of no exception. He is in the favour of God, whether enjoying his written word and ordinances or not. Nevertheless, the addition of these is an unspeakable blessing to those who were before in some measure accepted. Otherwise, God would never have sent an angel from heaven to direct Cornelius to Peter. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-6.htm" title="He lodges with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side: he shall tell you what you ought to do.">Acts 10:6</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:34-43 Acceptance cannot be obtained on any other ground than that of the covenant of mercy, through the atonement of Christ; but wherever true religion is found, God will accept it without regarding names or sects. The fear of God and works of righteousness are the substance of true religion, the effects of special grace. Though these are not the cause of a man's acceptance, yet they show it; and whatever may be wanting in knowledge or faith, will in due time be given by Him who has begun it. They knew in general the word, that is, the gospel, which God sent to the children of Israel. The purport of this word was, that God by it published the good tidings of peace by Jesus Christ. They knew the several matters of fact relating to the gospel. They knew the baptism of repentance which John preached. Let them know that this Jesus Christ, by whom peace is made between God and man, is Lord of all; not only as over all, God blessed for evermore, but as Mediator. All power, both in heaven and in earth, is put into his hand, and all judgment committed to him. God will go with those whom he anoints; he will be with those to whom he has given his Spirit. Peter then declares Christ's resurrection from the dead, and the proofs of it. Faith has reference to a testimony, and the Christian faith is built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, on the testimony given by them. See what must be believed concerning him. That we are all accountable to Christ as our Judge; so every one must seek his favour, and to have him as our Friend. And if we believe in him, we shall all be justified by him as our Righteousness. The remission of sins lays a foundation for all other favours and blessings, by taking that out of the way which hinders the bestowing of them. If sin be pardoned, all is well, and shall end well for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then Peter opened his mouth - Began to speak, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-2.htm">Matthew 5:2</a>.<p>Of a truth - Truly, evidently. That is, I have evidence here that God is no respecter of persons.<p>Is no respecter of persons - The word used here denotes "the act of showing favor to one on account of rank, family, wealth, or partiality arising from any cause." It is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1-4</a>. A judge is a respecter of persons when he favors one of the parties on account of private friendship, or because he is a man of rank, influence, or power, or because he belongs to the same political party, etc. The Jews supposed that they were especially favored by God. and that salvation was not extended to other nations, and that the fact of being a Jew entitled them to this favor. Peter here says that he had learned the error of this doctrine, and that a man is not to be accepted because he is a Jew, nor to be excluded because he is a Gentile. The barrier is broken down; the offer is made to all; God will save all on the same principle; not by external privileges or rank, but according to their character.<p>The same doctrine is elsewhere explicitly stated in the New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-11.htm">Romans 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-9.htm">Ephesians 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-25.htm">Colossians 3:25</a>. It may be observed here that this does not refer to the doctrine of divine sovereignty or election. It simply affirms that God will not save a man because he is a Jew, or because he is rich, or learned, or of elevated rank, or on account of external privileges; nor will he exclude a man because he is destitute of these privileges. But this does not affirm that he will not make a difference in their character, and then treat them according to their character, nor that he will not pardon whom he pleases. That is a different question. The interpretation of this passage should be limited strictly to the case in hand - to mean that God will not accept and save a man on account of external national rank and privileges. That he will not make a difference on other grounds is not affirmed here, nor anywhere in the Bible. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-7.htm">1 Corinthians 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>. It is worthy of remark further, that the most strenuous advocate for the doctrines of sovereignty and election - the apostle Paul - is also the one that labored most to establish the doctrine that God is no respecter of persons - that is, that there is no difference between the Jews and Gentiles in regard to the way of salvation; that God would not save a man because he was a Jew, nor destroy a man because he was a Gentile. Yet in regard to "the whole race viewed as lying on a level," he maintained that God has a right to exercise the prerogatives of a sovereign, and to have mercy on whom he will have mercy. The doctrine may be thus stated:<p>(1) The barrier between the Jews and Gentiles was broken down.<p>(2) all people thus were placed on a level none to be saved by external privileges, none to be lost by the lack of them.<p>(3) all were guilty <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1.htm">Romans 1-3</a>, and none had a claim on God.<p>(4) if any were saved, it would be by God showing mercy on such of this common mass as he chose.
