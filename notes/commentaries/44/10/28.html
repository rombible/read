The strict <span class= "ital">Jew</span> would not enter a Gentile’s house, nor sit on the same couch, nor eat or drink out of the same vessel. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/7-3.htm" title="For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, eat not, holding the tradition of the elders.">Mark 7:3-4</a>.) The very dust of a heathen city was defiling. The Hindoo feeling of caste, shrinking from contact with those of a lower grade, driven to madness and mutiny by “greased cartridges,” presents the nearest modern analogue.<p><span class= "bld">God hath shewed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.</span>—The Apostle had, we find, at last learnt the lesson which the vision had taught him, in all the fulness of its meaning. Humanity as such had been redeemed by the Incarnation and Ascension, and was no longer common or unclean, even in the most outcast heathen. God was willing to receive all men. Sin alone was that which separated men from Him. Impurity was thought of as a moral, not a physical taint, and men were taught to see even in the sinner the potentialities of a higher life. He, too, had been redeemed, and might be justified and sanctified, and to him therefore honour and reverence were due as to one in whom the image of God was not utterly effaced, and might be restored to brightness. It is interesting, in this connection, to note the “Honour all men” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-17.htm" title="Honor all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.">1Peter 2:17</a>. It is obvious that the pride of class, resting on mere differences of culture, and showing itself in acts and words of contempt, is, from one point of view, even less excusable than that which at least imagined that it rested on a religious basis, while from another, it is less inveterate, and therefore more easily curable.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-28.htm" title="And he said to them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come to one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean....">Acts 10:28-29</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he said, Ye know how it is an unlawful thing, </span>&c. — A thing not allowed by the Jews; <span class="ital">for a man that is a Jew </span>— A native Jew, as I am; <span class="ital">to keep company </span>with, <span class="ital">or come unto one of another nation </span>— A stranger, and an uncircumcised Gentile. This was not made unlawful by the law of God, but by the precepts of their wise men, which they looked upon to be no less obliging. They did not indeed forbid them to converse with Gentiles, in the way of traffic or worldly business, but to eat with them. With such scorn did the Jews look upon the Gentiles, who in their turn held them in equal contempt, as appears by many passages in the Latin poets. <span class="ital">But </span>now, saith Peter, <span class="ital">God hath showed me </span>— By a remarkable vision; <span class="ital">that I should not call any man common or unclean — </span>Peter thought it necessary to inform them how he came to change his mind in this matter, lest, being thought to have used lightness, his word should have the less authority. <span class="ital">Therefore </span>— Having received direction from God; <span class="ital">came I unto you without gainsaying </span>— Or delay; <span class="ital">as soon as I was sent for </span>— Ready to preach the same gospel to you that I preached to the Jews. <span class="ital">I ask, therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me </span>— Although Peter in a great measure knew this already, he puts Cornelius on telling the story, both that his friends, and all that were present, might be informed, and Cornelius himself be more impressed by the narration; the repetition of which, even as we read it, gives a new dignity and spirit to Peter’s succeeding discourse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:19-33 When we see our call clear to any service, we should not be perplexed with doubts and scruples arising from prejudices or former ideas. Cornelius had called together his friends, to partake with him of the heavenly wisdom he expected from Peter. We should not covet to eat our spiritual morsels alone. It ought to be both given and taken as kindness and respect to our kindred and friends, to invite them to join us in religious exercises. Cornelius declared the direction God gave him to send for Peter. We are right in our aims in attending a gospel ministry, when we do it with regard to the Divine appointment requiring us to make use of that ordinance. How seldom ministers are called to speak to such companies, however small, in which it may be said that they are all present in the sight of God, to hear all things that are commanded of God!

The design was to keep them a separate people. To do this, Moses forbade alliances by contract, or marriage, with the surrounding nations, which were idolatrous.

That day their mother saw two of her sons high-priests.” The Apostle speaks of the prohibition as a thing well known to those who heard him, and the action of the messengers of Cornelius in standing outside the house of Simon and calling out some one to question in the open air shews that they were aware of the dislike of the Jews to associate with Gentiles. We have evidence that this dislike was well known wherever the Jews resided from the words of Juvenal (xiv. 103), “Non monstrare vias eadem nisi sacra colenti.” So Tacitus (<span class="ital">Hist</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-5.htm" title="And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter:">Acts 10:5</a>), “separati epulis, discreti cubilibus.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to keep company</span>] Lit. “to join himself.” The word is the same as in the command to Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-29.htm" title="Then the Spirit said to Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot.">Acts 8:29</a>), “Go near and <span class="ital">join thyself</span> to this chariot;” and signifies intimate intercourse.

The Jews professed to ground this prohibition on the law of Moses; but there is no direct command in the Mosaic law forbidding Jews to associate with those of other nations. But Peter's statement is general, referring to the general practice of the Jews to separate themselves in common life from uncircumcised persons. Juvenal says that the Jews were taught by Moses "not to show the way except to one who practises the same rites, and to guide the circumcised alone to the well which they seek" (Sat., xiv., 104, 105).
