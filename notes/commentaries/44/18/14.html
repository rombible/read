In any case, from his standpoint, as philosopher and statesman, it was not a matter for his tribunal. He was not anxious to draw a hard and fast line as to the <span class= "ital">relligiones licitæ</span> recognised by the State.<p><span class= "bld">A matter of wrong or wicked lewdness.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">a matter of crime or fraud.</span> “Lewdness,” which to us suggests a special class of crimes, is used as “lewd” had been in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-5.htm" title="But the Jews which believed not, moved with envy, took to them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort, and gathered a company, and set all the city on an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.">Acts 17:5</a>. The Greek word is very closely connected with that translated “subtlety” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>.

How little Gallio dreamed that he would live for ever in men’s mouths by reason of this one judicial dictum! He was Seneca’s brother, and was possibly leavened by his philosophy and indisposed to severity. He has been unjustly condemned. There are some striking lessons from the story.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The remarkable anticipation of the true doctrine as to the functions of civil magistrates.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Gallio draws a clear distinction between conduct and opinion, and excepts the whole of the latter region from his sway. It is the first case in which the civil authorities refused to take cognisance of a charge against a man on account of his opinions. Nineteen hundred years have not brought all tribunals up to that point yet. Gallio indeed was influenced mainly by philosophic contempt for the trivialities of what he thought a superstition. We are influenced by our recognition of the sanctity of individual conviction, and still more by reverence for truth and by the belief that it should depend only on its own power for progress and on itself for the defeat of its enemies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The tragic mistake about the nature of the Gospel which men make.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>There is something very pathetic in the erroneous estimates made by those persons mentioned in Acts who some once or twice come in contact with the preachers of Christ. How little they recognise what was before them! Their responsibility is in better hands than ours. But in Gallio there is a trace of tendencies always in operation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We see in him the practical man’s contempt for mere ideas. The man of affairs, be he statesman or worker, is always apt to think that things are more than thoughts. Gallio, proconsul in Corinth, and his brother official, Pilate, in Jerusalem, both believed in powers that they could see. The question of the one, for an answer to which he did not wait, was not the inquiry of a searcher after truth, but the exclamation of a sceptic who thought all the contradictory answers that rang through the world to be demonstrations that the question had no answer. The impatient refusal of the other to have any concern in settling ‘such matters’ was steeped in the same characteristically Roman spirit of impatient distrust and suspicion of mere ideas. He believed in Roman force and authority, and thought that such harmless visionaries as Paul and his company might be allowed to go their own way, and he did not know that they carried with them a solvent and constructive power before which the solid-seeming structure of the Empire was destined to crumble, as surely as thick-ribbed ice before the sirocco.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And how many of us believe in wealth and material progress, and regard the region of truth as very shadowy and remote! This is a danger besetting us all. The true forces that sway the world are ideas.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We see in Gallio supercilious indifference to mere ‘theological subtleties.’ To him Paul’s preaching and the Jews’ passionate denials of it seemed only a squabble about ‘words and names.’ Probably he had gathered his impression from Paul’s eager accusers, who would charge him with giving the name of ‘Christ’ to Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Gallio’s attitude was partly Stoical contempt for all superstitions, partly, perhaps, an eclectic belief that all these warring religions were really saying the same thing and differed only in words and names; and partly sheer indifference to the whole subject. Thus Christianity appears to many in this day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What is it in reality? Not words but power: a Name, indeed, but a Name which is life. Alas for us, who by our jangling have given colour to this misconception!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We see in Gallio the mistake that the Gospel has little relation to conduct. Gallio drew a broad distinction between conduct and opinion, and there he was right. But he imagined that this opinion had nothing to do with conduct, and how wrong he was there we need not elaborate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Gospel is the mightiest power for shaping conduct.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The ignorant levity with which men pass the crisis of their lives.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>How little Gallio knew of what a possibility was opened out before him! Angels were hovering unseen. We seldom recognise the fateful moments of our lives till they are past.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The offer of salvation in Christ is ever a crisis. It may never be repeated. Was Gallio ever again brought into contact with Paul or Paul’s Lord? We know not. He passes out of sight, the search-light is turned in another direction, and we lose him in the darkness. The extent of his criminality is in better hands than ours, though we cannot but let our thoughts go forward to the time when he, like us all, will stand at the judgment bar of Jesus, no longer a judge but judged. Let us hope that before he passed hence, he learned how full of spirit and of life the message was, which he once took for a mere squabble about ‘words and names,’ and thought too trivial to occupy his court. And let us remember that the Jesus, whom we are sometimes tempted to judge as of little importance to us, will one day judge us, and that His judgment will settle our fate for evermore.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-14.htm" title="And when Paul was now about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked lewdness, O you Jews, reason would that I should bear with you:...">Acts 18:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when Paul was now about to open his mouth </span>— To speak in his own defence; <span class="ital">Gallio </span>— Sensible of the futility of the charge; <span class="ital">said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong, or wicked lewdness </span>— With which you charged the person you have now brought before me: that is, If you accused this man of any injury done to particular persons, or of wantonly disturbing the peace of society; <span class="ital">reason would </span>— That is, it were reasonable; <span class="ital">that I should bear with you </span>— In this prosecution; and even that I should exert the power with which I am invested, to punish the offender in proportion to his crime. <span class="ital">But if it be a question of words </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">περι λογου</span>, <span class="ital">concerning discourse, </span>or doctrine; <span class="ital">and </span>of <span class="ital">names, and of your law </span>— If your accusation respect opinions taught by Paul, which ye think heretical; and whether the names of <span class="ital">the Christ, </span>and <span class="ital">the Son of God, </span>which he hath given to any one, ought to be given to that person; and whether all who worship the God of the Jews, are bound to worship him according to the rites of your law; <span class="ital">look ye to it — </span>These are matters which belong to yourselves, and with which, as a magistrate, I have no concern. <span class="ital">I will be no judge of such matters </span>— Matters so foreign to my office. The apparent coolness and contempt with which Gallio speaks of the matters in debate between Paul and the Jews does not merit commendation, but the severest censure. The names of the heathen gods, and the institutions concerning their worship and service, were fables, shadows, and deceits; but the question concerning the name of Jesus, his person, character, and offices, and the worship and service of the living and true God, is of more importance than all things else under heaven. Yet, there is this singularity (among a thousand others) in the Christian religion, that human reason, curious as it is in all other things, abhors to inquire into it. <span class="ital">And he drave them from the judgment-seat </span>— Not regarding their clamorous importunity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:12-17 Paul was about to show that he did not teach men to worship God contrary to law; but the judge would not allow the Jews to complain to him of what was not within his office. It was right in Gallio that he left the Jews to themselves in matters relating to their religion, but yet would not let them, under pretence of that, persecute another. But it was wrong to speak slightly of a law and religion which he might have known to be of God, and which he ought to have acquainted himself with. In what way God is to be worshipped, whether Jesus be the Messiah, and whether the gospel be a Divine revelation, are not questions of words and names, they are questions of vast importance. Gallio spoke as if he boasted of his ignorance of the Scriptures, as if the law of God was beneath his notice. Gallio cared for none of these things. If he cared not for the affronts of bad men, it was commendable; but if he concerned not himself for the abuses done to good men, his indifference was carried too far. And those who see and hear of the sufferings of God's people, and have no feeling with them, or care for them, who do not pity and pray for them, are of the same spirit as Gallio, who cared for none of these things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>About to open his mouth - In self-defense, ever ready to vindicate his conduct.<p>A matter of wrong - Injustice, or crime, such as could be properly brought before a court of justice.<p>Or wicked lewdness - Any flagrant and gross offence.
