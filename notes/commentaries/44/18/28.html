The process was, perhaps, somewhat different, as the line of argument in the Epistle to the Hebrews differs from that in the Epistle to the Galatians. To lead men on, after the manner of Philo, into the deeper meanings that lay beneath the letter of Scripture, to deal with them as those who were pressing forwards to the perfection of maturity in spiritual growth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-11.htm" title="Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered, seeing you are dull of hearing.">Hebrews 5:11-14</a>), instead of treating them as children who must be fed with milk and not with “strong meat” (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>solid food), as St. Paul had done (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1Corinthians 1:2</a>)—it was natural that this should attract followers to the new preacher, and give him a larger measure of real or apparent success in dealing with the Jews than had attended the labours of St. Paul. As Apollos does not appear again in the Acts, it may be well to bring together what is known as to his after-history. At Corinth, as has been said, his name was used as the watchword of a party, probably that of the philosophising Jews and proselytes, as distinguished from the narrower party of the circumcision that rallied round the name of Cephas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="Now this I say, that every one of you said, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.">1Corinthians 1:12</a>). Not a word escapes from St. Paul that indicates any doctrinal difference between himself and Apollos, and as the latter had been instructed by St. Paul’s friends, Aquila and Priscilla, this was, indeed, hardly probable. It would appear from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>, that he returned to Ephesus, probably with letters of commendation from the Church of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="Do we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some others, letters of commendation to you, or letters of commendation from you?">2Corinthians 3:1</a>). St. Paul’s confidence in him is shown by his desire that he should return once more to Corinth with Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus. His own reluctance to be the occasion even of the semblance of schism explains his unwillingness to go (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1Corinthians 16:12</a>). After this we lose sight of him for some years. These, we may well believe, were well filled up by evangelising labours after the pattern of those which we have seen at Ephesus and Corinth. Towards the close of St. Paul’s ministry (A. D. 65) we get our last glimpse of him, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-13.htm" title="Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey diligently, that nothing be wanting to them.">Titus 3:13</a>. He is in company with Zenas, the lawyer (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-35.htm" title="Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying,">Matthew 22:35</a>), one, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, who, like himself, had a special reputation for the profounder knowledge of the Law of Moses. St. Paul’s feeling towards him is still, as of old, one of affectionate interest, and he desires that Titus will help him in all things. He has been labouring at Crete, and there also has gathered round him a distinct company of disciples, whom St. Paul distinguishes from his own; “Let <span class= "ital">our’s</span> also learn to maintain good works” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>). After this, probably after St. Paul’s death, he wrote—if we accept Luther’s conjecture—the Epistle to the Hebrews, addressed, as some have thought, to the Jewish Christians of Palestine, and specially of Cæsarea, but, more probably, as I have been led to believe, to the Christian ascetics, known as Therapeutæ, trained, like himself, in the school of Philo, with whom he had formerly been associated at Alexandria. The mention of disciples of, or from, Italy in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-24.htm" title="Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the saints. They of Italy salute you.">Hebrews 13:24</a> suggests a connection with some other Italian Christians than those of Rome, probably with those of Puteoli. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-14.htm" title="Where we found brothers, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome.">Acts 28:14</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:24-28 Apollos taught in the gospel of Christ, as far as John's ministry would carry him, and no further. We cannot but think he had heard of Christ's death and resurrection, but he was not informed as to the mystery of them. Though he had not the miraculous gifts of the Spirit, as the apostles, he made use of the gifts he had. The dispensation of the Spirit, whatever the measure of it may be, is given to every man to profit withal. He was a lively, affectionate preacher; fervent in spirit. He was full of zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of precious souls. Here was a complete man of God, thoroughly furnished for his work. Aquila and Priscilla encouraged his ministry, by attendance upon it. They did not despise Apollos themselves, or undervalue him to others; but considered the disadvantages he had laboured under. And having themselves got knowledge in the truths of the gospel by their long intercourse with Paul, they told what they knew to him. Young scholars may gain a great deal by converse with old Christians. Those who do believe through grace, yet still need help. As long as they are in this world, there are remainders of unbelief, and something lacking in their faith to be perfected, and the work of faith to be fulfilled. If the Jews were convinced that Jesus is Christ, even their own law would teach them to hear him. The business of ministers is to preach Christ. Not only to preach the truth, but to prove and defend it, with meekness, yet with power.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he mightily convinced the Jews - He did it by strong arguments; he bore down all opposition, and effectually silenced them.<p>And that publicly - In his public preaching in the synagogue and elsewhere.<p>Showing by the scriptures - Proving from the Old Testament.

Thus his ministry would be as good as another visitation to the Achaian churches by the apostle himself (see 1Co 3:6) and the more as, in so far as he was indebted for it to Priscilla and Aquila, it would have a decidedly Pauline cast.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Mightily; </span> with great constancy, perseverance, and enduring of opposition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Showing by the Scriptures that Jesus was Christ; </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-3.htm" title="Opening and alleging, that Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach to you, is Christ.">Acts 17:3</a></span>.

How may we account for this different phraseology? If St. Luke had meant Galatia proper, we may believe that he would have used the word <span class="greekheb">Γαλατία</span>, but as he says <span class="greekheb">Γαλατικὴ χώρα</span> he speaks as a Greek and indicates the Roman province Galatia, or the Galatic province; a name by which the Greek-speaking natives called it, whilst sometimes they enumerated its parts, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Pontus Galaticus, Phrygia Galatica, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, pp. 126, 127, August, 1898 (Ramsay), and Hastings’ B.D., “Galatia” (Ramsay), pp. 87–89, 1899; <span class="ital">cf.</span> the form of the derived adjective in -<span class="greekheb">ικός</span> in the pair <span class="greekheb">Λακωνικὴ γῆ</span> and <span class="greekheb">Λακωνία</span>. St. Paul on the other hand, speaking as a Roman citizen, used the word <span class="greekheb">Γαλατία</span> as = the Roman province, for not only is there evidence that <span class="greekheb">Γαλ</span>. could be so employed in current official usage (the contrary hypothesis is now abandoned by Schürer, one of its former staunch supporters, see <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 128, and Hastings’ B.D., ii., 86), but it seems beyond all dispute that St. Paul in other cases classified his Churches in accordance with the Roman provinces, Asia, Macedonia, Achaia, <span class="ital">Expositor, u. s.</span>, p. 125; Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., 124; Renan, <span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 51; Hausrath, <span class="ital">Neutest. Zeitgeschichte</span>, iii., p. 135; Clemen, <span class="ital">Chron. der Paulinischen Briefe</span>, p. 121. Why then should the Churches of Galatia be interpreted otherwise? Ramsay (“Questions,” <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, January, 1899) may well appeal to Dr. Hort’s decisive acceptance of the view that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-1.htm" title="Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,">1 Peter 1:1</a> (<span class="ital">First Epistle of St. Peter</span>, pp. 17, 158) the Churches are named according to the provinces of the Roman empire (a point emphasised by Hausrath, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, in advocating the South-Galatian theory), and that in provincial Galatia St. Peter included at least the Churches founded by St. Paul in Galatia proper, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in Phrygia and Lycaonia, although it must be remembered that Dr. Hort still followed Lightfoot in maintaining that the Galatians of St. Paul’s Epistle were true Galatians, and not the inhabitants of the Roman province. “But if St. Peter, as Hort declares, classed Antioch, Iconium, Derbe and Lystra among the Churches of Galatia, must not Paul have done the same thing? Is it likely that 1 Peter, a letter so penetrated with the Pauline spirit, so much influenced by at least two Pauline Epistles, composed in such close relations with two of Paul’s coadjutors, Silas and Mark, should class the Pauline Churches after a method that Paul would not employ?” (Ramsay, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, January, 1899.) The Churches which in this view are thus included in the province Galatia, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, Pisidian Antioch, Iconium, Lystra, Derbe, would be fitly addressed as Galatians by a Roman citizen writing to provincials proud of Roman names and titles (although Wendt (1899) urges this mode of address, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?">Galatians 3:1</a>, as one of two decisive points against the South Galatian theory). For we must not forget that two of the four Churches in South Galatia were Roman <span class="ital">coloniæ</span>, Antioch and Lystra, whilst the two others mentioned in Acts 14 bore an emperor s name, Claudio-Iconium, Claudio-Derbe. That the title “Galatians” might be so applied to the people of Roman “Galatia” has been sufficiently illustrated by Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 130, and Ramsay, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, August, 1898, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Tac., <span class="ital">Ann.</span>, xiii., 35, xv., 6; <span class="ital">Hist.</span>, ii., 9; and it is very noteworthy that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a> St. Paul in addressing the inhabitants of a Roman <span class="ital">colonia</span> addresses them by a Latin and not a Greek form of their name, <span class="greekheb">φιλιππήσιοι</span> = Latin, <span class="ital">Philippenses</span>, so that in addressing the four Churches of South Galatia, so closely connected with Rome as we have seen, St. Paul would naturally address them by the one title common to them all as belonging to a Roman province, <span class="ital">Galatæ</span>, Galatians; Ramsay, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, August, 1898; McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, pp. 177–179.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>St. Paul then uses the term Galatia as a Roman citizen would use it, while St. Luke employs the phraseology common in the Ægean land amongst his contemporaries; he does not speak of Galatia, by which term he would as a Greek mean North Galatia, but of the “Galatic territory” or of the region or regions with which he was concerned; see on this <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, August, 1898, pp. 126, 127, and Hastings’ B.D., “Galatia”. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a> he writes of a missionary tour (see on <span class="greekheb">διῆλθον</span>, note, <span class="ital">l. c.</span>) through the Phrygo-Galatic region; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a> he speaks of a missionary tour through the Galatic region (Derbe and Lystra) and the Phrygian (Iconium and Antioch). It is, moreover, important to note that whether we take <span class="greekheb">φρυγία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>, as an adjective, <span class="greekheb">χώρα</span> being understood, or as a noun, the same sense prevails, for we have evidence from inscriptions of Antioch that Galatic Phrygia was often designated by the noun, “and St. Luke may be allowed to speak as the people of Antioch wrote,” Ramsay, Hastings’ B.D., ii., p. 90, 1899. See further the same writer’s reference to the testimony of Asterius, Bishop of Amasia in Pontus Galaticus, A.D. 400, in favour of the above view, who paraphrases <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν Λυκαονίαν καὶ τὰς τῆς φρυγίας πόλεις</span>, and places the journey through Lycaonia and Phrygia immediately before the visit to Asia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a>; see especially Ramsay, <span class="ital">Studia Biblica</span>, iv., p. 16 ff. and p. 90; Hastings’ B.D., <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, as against Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 136.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But further: if the Phrygo-Galatic district thus lay on the road to Ephesus, it is difficult to see how St. Paul could be conceived of as going to a distance of some 300 miles out of his route to Galatia in the narrower ethnical sense of the word; and this is one of the many points which influences Mr. Turner to regard the South Galatia view as almost demonstrably true, <span class="ital">Chron. of the N.T.;</span> Hastings’ B.D., i., 422 (see also to the same effect, Renan, <span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 52; and Rendall, <span class="ital">Acts</span>, p. 275; Salmon, <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, p. 377). McGiffert (so too Renan, Hausrath) maintains that if the North Galatian theory is correct, and St. Paul is not addressing the Churches founded on his first missionary journey, but only those founded, as we must suppose, during a period of missionary labour in North Galatia, a period inserted without a hint from St. Luke in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>, it seems incomprehensible why Barnabas should be mentioned in the Galatian Epistle. The Churches in North Galatia could scarcely have known anything about him, especially as <span class="ital">ex hypothesi</span> they had been evangelised after the rupture between Paul and Barnabas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm" title="And some days after Paul said to Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brothers in every city where we have preached the word of the LORD, and see how they do.">Acts 15:36</a> ff. If, however, the Churches of the Epistle = the Churches founded in Acts 13, 14, then we can at once understand the mention of Barnabas. But Mr. Askwith has lately pointed out with much force (<span class="ital">Epistle to the Galatians</span>, p. 77, 1899) that this argument must not be pressed too far. The introduction of Barnabas in the Galatian Epistle does not prove that he was known <span class="ital">personally</span> to the Galatians (although it may reasonably warrant the inference that he was known by <span class="ital">name</span>) any more than the allusion to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm" title="Or I only and Barnabas, have not we power to forbear working?">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>, proves that he was personally known to the Corinthians, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Colossians</span>, p. 28.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>One more significant and weighty fact deserves mention. In St. Paul’s collection for the poor Saints (on the importance of which see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>) there is every reason to believe that all the Pauline Churches shared; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a> appeal is made to the Churches of Galatia and Achaia, and the Churches of Macedonia and Asia subsequently contributed to the fund. If by Galatia we understand Galatia proper, and not the Roman province, then the four South Galatian Churches are not included in the list of subscribers, and they are not even asked to contribute. This appears inconceivable; whereas, if we look at the list of delegates, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a>, whilst Macedonia and Asia are represented, and Gaius and Timothy represent the Churches of South Galatia, no delegate is mentioned from any North Galatian community (see Rendall: “Pauline collection for the Saints,” <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, Nov., 1898, and “The Galatians of St. Paul,” <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, April, 1894; also Weizsäcker, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, i., 272, E.T., and McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 180, Askwith, <span class="ital">Epistle to the Galatians</span>, p. 88 ff. (1899)). For the literature of the question see Ramsay, “Galatia,” Hastings’ B.D., ii., p. 89, 1899; Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., pp. 129, 130; Wendt (1899), p. 276, and “Galatians, Epistle to the,” Marcus Dods, Hastings’ B.D., ii., 94. To the list given in the last reference may be added the names of Wendt, O. Holtzmann, Clemen.V. Weber (Würsburg), Page, Rendall, McGiffert, in favour of the South Galatian view, and most recently Askwith, <span class="ital">Epistle to the Galatians</span> (1899); whilst to the other side may be added Volkmar, Schürer, Holsten, who has examined the whole subject closely in his <span class="ital">Das Evangelium des Paulus</span>, p. 35 ff. (chiefly in reply to Hausrath’s strong support of the opposing view), Zöckler, Jülicher, Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Theol.</span>, p. 186 ff. and p. 353, 1896, Schmiedel, and amongst English writers, Findlay, <span class="ital">Epistles of St. Paul</span>, p. 288 ff., and very fully Dr. Chase, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, 1893, 1894.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We can only make a passing allusion to the date or possible date of the Galatian Epistle. Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 189 ff., places it at the close of the Apostle’s second missionary journey during his stay at Antioch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a> (A.D. 55), whilst McGiffert also places it at Antioch, but <span class="ital">before</span> the Apostle started on this same journey, not at its close, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 226. Rendall, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, April, 1894, has assigned it an earlier date, 51, 52, and places it amongst the earliest of St. Paul’s Epistles, and more recently Zahn has dated it almost equally early in the beginning of 53, and upon somewhat similar grounds, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 139 (the three oldest Epistles of St. Paul according to him being the group of Galatians, 1 Thessalonians, 2 Thessalonians, all written in the same year). But on the other hand, Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 43 ff., and Salmon, <span class="ital">Introd.</span>, p. 376, not only place the Epistle later than any of the dates suggested above, but assign it a place between 2 Corinthians and Romans, arguing from the similarity of subject and style between the three Epistles. Most of the continental critics would place it in the same group, but as the earliest of the four great Epistles written in the earlier period of the Apostle’s long residence at Ephesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper coasts came to Ephesus: and finding certain disciples,">Acts 19:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot places it apparently on the journey between Macedonia and Achaia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a>, 2 Corinthians having been previously written during the Apostle’s residence in Macedonia (so Zahn), Romans being dated a little later whilst St. Paul stayed in Corinth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,...">Acts 20:2-3</a> (<span class="ital">Galatians</span>, pp. 39, 55). Dr. Clemen has since defended at great length his view, first put forward in <span class="ital">Chronol. der Paul. Briefe</span>, p. 199 ff., that Romans preceded Galatians, in <span class="ital">Studien und Kritiken</span>, 1897, 2, pp. 219–270; but see as against Clemen, Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 142; Zöckler, <span class="ital">Die Briefe an die Thess. und Galater</span>, p. 71; Sanday and Headlam, <span class="ital">Romans</span>, p. xxxviii. Mr. Askwith has recently discussed the points at issue between Ramsay and Lightfoot as to the date of Galatians, and in accepting the latter’s position as his own, he has shown that this is not incompatible with a firm recognition of the South Galatian theory, <span class="ital">Epistle to the Galatians</span>, p. 98 ff. Harnack, <span class="ital">Chronol.</span>, p. 239, declines to commit himself to any definite date for Galatians, and perhaps this conclusion is not surprising in relation to an Epistle of which it may be truly said that it has been placed by different critics in the beginning, in the close, and in every intermediate stage of St. Paul’s epistolary activity, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Dr. Marcus Dods, “Galatians,” Hastings’ B.D.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">for he mightily convinced the Jews</span>] The verb expresses more than is given thus. He brought the objections of the Jews to the test of Scripture and <span class="bld">confuted</span> them. The disciples, who had already believed, appear to have been suffering from Jewish gainsayers. It was by his power in the Scriptures that Apollos was helpful against these adversaries of the faith. The <span class="ital">Revised Version</span> has changed “mightily” into “powerfully” to little profit.

It is remarkable that the success of Apollos at Corinth seems to have been chiefly among the Jews, who had opposed themselves so vehemently to St. Paul (ver. 6). It is one of the many proofs of the singleness of eye and simplicity of purpose of the great apostle, that the success of this novice where he himself had failed did not excite the least jealousy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>). St. Luke, too, Paul's friend and biographer, here speaks of the powers and work of Apollos with no stinted measure of praise. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Mightily (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-10.htm">Luke 23:10</a>.<p>Convinced (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;)<p>Only here in New Testament.
