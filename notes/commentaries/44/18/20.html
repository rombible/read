Nowhere, among the churches that he founded, does St. Paul seem to have found so great a receptivity for spiritual truth. While he looked on the Corinthians as being children requiring to be fed with milk (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1Corinthians 3:2</a>), he saw in the Ephesians those to whom he did not shun to declare “the whole counsel of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm" title="For I have not shunned to declare to you all the counsel of God.">Acts 20:27</a>), to whom he could, at a later date, appeal as able to measure his knowledge of the mystery of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-4.htm" title="Whereby, when you read, you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ)">Ephesians 3:4</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:18-23 While Paul found he laboured not in vain, he continued labouring. Our times are in God's hand; we purpose, but he disposes; therefore we must make all promises with submission to the will of God; not only if providence permits, but if God does not otherwise direct our motions. A very good refreshment it is to a faithful minister, to have for awhile the society of his brethren. Disciples are compassed about with infirmity; ministers must do what they can to strengthen them, by directing them to Christ, who is their Strength. Let us earnestly seek, in our several places, to promote the cause of Christ, forming plans that appear to us most proper, but relying on the Lord to bring them to pass if he sees good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he came to Ephesus - See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/2-1.htm">Revelation 2:1-5</a>. This was a celebrated city in Ionia, in Asia Minor, about 40 miles south of Smyrna. It was chiefly famous for the Temple of Diana, usually reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world. Pliny styles this city the ornament of Asia. In the times of the Romans it was the metropolis of the province of Asia. This city is now under the dominion of the Turks, and is almost in a state of ruin. Dr. Chandler, in his Travels in Asia Mirror, says: "The inhabitants are a few Greek peasants, living in extreme wretchedness, dependence, and insensibility; the representatives of an illustrious people, and inhabiting the wreck of their greatness; some in the substructions of the glorious edifices which they raised; some beneath the vaults of the stadium, once the crowded scene of their diversions; and some in the sepulchres which received their ashes" (Travels, p. 131, Oxford, 1775). The Jews, according to Josephus, were very numerous in Ephesus, and had obtained the privilege of citizenship.<p>Left them there - That is, Aquila and Priscilla, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-24.htm">Acts 18:24-26</a>.<p>Reasoned with the Jews - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm">Acts 17:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. when they desired him to tarry&#8212;The Jews seldom rose against the Gospel till the successful preaching of it stirred them up, and there was no time for that here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They desired; </span> that is, Aquila and Priscilla, whom Paul would not yield unto. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He consented not; </span> by God’s wonderful providence, which overrules all our inclinations; Paul having greater things to do and suffer for the glory of God elsewhere. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When they desired him to tarry longer time with them,....
