Christ came into the world to bring a blessing with him. And he sent his Spirit to be the great blessing. Christ came to bless us, by turning us from our iniquities, and saving us from our sins. We, by nature cleave to sin; the design of Divine grace is to turn us from it, that we may not only forsake, but hate it. Let none think that they can be happy by continuing in sin, when God declares that the blessing is in being turned from all iniquity. Let none think that they understand or believe the gospel, who only seek deliverance from the punishment of sin, but do not expect happiness in being delivered from sin itself. And let none expect to be turned from their sin, except by believing in, and receiving Christ the Son of God, as their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And it shall come to pass - It shall be, or shall occur. This is not the usual word rendered "it shall come to pass." It is a word commonly expressing "futurity," but here it conveys the notion of "obligation." In this verse Peter has not quoted the passage in Deuteronomy literally, but he has given the sense.<p>Every soul - Every "person" or "individual." Soul is often put for the whole man by the Hebrews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-14.htm">Acts 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm">Joshua 10:28</a>.<p>Hear that Prophet - That is, obey his instructions. He shall have authority to declare the will of God; and he that does not obey him refuses to obey God. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-16.htm">Luke 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-20.htm">John 13:20</a>.<p>Shall be destroyed - This quotation is made according to the sense, and not literally. In the Hebrew the expression is <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>, "I will require it of him," that is, I will hold him answerable or responsible for it; I will punish him. This expression the Septuagint has rendered by "I will take vengeance on him." The idea of the passage is, therefore, that God would publish the man that would not hear the prophet, without specifying the particular way in which it should be done. The usual mode of punishing such offences was by cutting the offender off from among the people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-33.htm">Exodus 30:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-15.htm">Exodus 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-31.htm">Numbers 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-20.htm">Leviticus 7:20-21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-25.htm">Leviticus 7:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-27.htm">Leviticus 7:27</a>, etc. The sense is, that he should be punished in the usual manner; that is, by excision, or by being destroyed from among the people. The word translated "shall be destroyed" means properly "to exterminate, wholly to devote to ruin," as of a wicked people, a wicked man whose life is taken, etc.<p>To be destroyed from among the people means, however, to be excommunicated, or to be deprived of the privileges of a people. Among the Jews this was probably the most severe punishment that could be inflicted. It involved the idea of being cut off from the privileges of sacrifice and worship in the temple and in the synagogue, etc., and of being regarded as a pagan and an outcast. The idea which Peter expressed here was, that the Jews had exposed themselves to the severest punishment in rejecting and crucifying the Lord Jesus, and that they should, therefore, repent of this great sin, and seek for mercy. The same remark is applicable still to people. The Scriptures abundantly declare the truth, that if sinners will not hear the Lord Jesus, they shall be destroyed. And it becomes each individual to inquire with honesty whether he listens to his instructions and obeys his Law, or whether he is rejecting him and following the devices and desires of his own heart. It will be a solemn day when the sinner shall be called to render a reason why he has rejected the teachings and laws of the Son of God! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. a prophet &#8230; like unto me&#8212;particularly in intimacy of communication with God (Nu 12:6-8), and as the mediatorial Head of a new order of things (Heb 3:2-6).

The expression, which is not in the Hebrew. seems to call attention to what follows.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξολεθρευθήσεται ἐκ τοῦ λαοῦ</span>: “shall be utterly destroyed” (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ</span>), R.V. In the LXX, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>, following the Hebrew, the words are <span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ ἐκδικήσω ἐξ πὐτοῦ</span>, “I will require it of him”. But the phrase which St. Peter uses was a very common one, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-14.htm" title="And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.">Genesis 17:14</a>, for the sentence of death, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-15.htm" title="Seven days shall you eat unleavened bread; even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel.">Exodus 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-19.htm" title="Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eats that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he be a stranger, or born in the land.">Exodus 12:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-4.htm" title="And brings it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed to that man; he has shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among his people:">Leviticus 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-9.htm" title="And brings it not to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, to offer it to the LORD; even that man shall be cut off from among his people.">Leviticus 17:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-30.htm" title="But the soul that does ought presumptuously, whether he be born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproaches the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.">Numbers 15:30</a>. Here again the quotation is evidently made freely or from memory. The strong verb, although frequent in the LXX, is found only here in the N.T. It is used by Josephus and by Philo, but not in classical Greek. The warning is evidently directed against wilful disobedience, and is expressed in terms signifying the utterness of the destruction from the people. But in their original meaning in the O.T. they need not refer to anything more than the penalty of the death of the body, and it is not necessary to see in them here any threat of eternal punishment in Gehenna (so Wendt, Holtzmann, Felten). If the word has any eschatological bearing it would support the theory of annihilation more easily. Grotius explains <span class="greekheb">ἐξολεθ</span>., “morte violenta aut immatura,” and he adds “mystice etiam Rabbini hoc ad poenas post hanc vitam referunt,” but this is quite apart from the primary meaning of the word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.">Acts 3:23</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔσται δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">moreover it shall come to pass</span>) <span class="greekheb">והיה</span>, a modal [See Append. on ‘Modalis’] formula, exciting attention.—<span class="greekheb">ἥτις ἐὰν</span>, whatsoever) It is implied that many are about to hear this Prophet, and many not about to hear Him.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξολοθρευθήσεται</span>, shall be utterly destroyed, or exterminated) Instead of the Hebrew, “I will require it of him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>), is put that customary formula concerning <span class="greekheb">כרת</span>, utter cutting off.
