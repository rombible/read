Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he took him - He took hold of his hand. To take hold of the hand in such a ease was an offer of aid, an indication that Peter was sincere, and was an inducement to him to make an effort. This may be employed as a beautiful illustration of the manner of God when he commands people to repent and believe. He does not leave them alone; he extends help, and aids their efforts. If they tremble, and feel that they are weak, and needy, and helpless, his hand is stretched out and his power exerted to impart strength and grace.<p>His feet and ankle-bones - The fact that strength was immediately imparted; that the feet, long lame, were now made strong, was a full and clear proof of miraculous power. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

But as the word is so manifestly characteristic of St. Luke it is noteworthy that in the large majority of instances it is employed by him in connection with miracles of healing or the infliction of disease and death, and this frequency of use and application may be paralleled by the constant employment of the word in an analogous way in medical writers; see, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Hobart, <span class="ital">Medical Language of St. Luke</span>, and instances in Hippocrates, Galen, Dioscorides.—<span class="greekheb">ἐστερεώθησαν</span>: <span class="greekheb">στερεόω</span> = to make firm or solid; it cannot by any means be regarded only as a technical medical term, but as a matter of fact it was often employed in medical language (so also the adjective <span class="greekheb">στερεός</span>), and this use of the word makes it a natural one for a medical man to employ here, especially in connection with <span class="greekheb">βάσεις</span> and <span class="greekheb">σφυρά</span>. It is used only by St. Luke in the N.T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm" title="And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.">Acts 16:5</a>), but very frequently in the LXX. The nearest approach to a medical use of the word is given perhaps by Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, Xen., <span class="ital">Pæd.</span>, viii.—<span class="greekheb">αἱ βάσεις</span>, “the feet” (<span class="greekheb">βαίνω</span>).

And it is hardly possible to dwell too strongly on indications of this kind, which indirectly mark in the history something which is likewise noted in the Epistles. Those who would assign the second century as the date of the composition of the Acts, must assume for their supposed writer the keenest appreciation of every slight allusion in the letters of St Paul, and at the same time an ability to let his knowledge peep out only in hints like that which we find in this verse. Such persons, while rejecting all that is miraculous in the story as we have it, ask us to believe in such a writer as would himself be almost a miracle, for his powers of observation and the skill with which he has employed them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">received strength</span>] Though from want of use, they must have been withered before.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm" title="And he took him by the right hand, and lifted him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.">Acts 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτὸν</span>, <span class="ital">him</span>) It was the part of the blind man merely to give himself up to the power which was entering into him.—<span class="greekheb">αἱ βάσεις καὶ τὰ σφυρὰ</span>) As to both Greek words there is much disputation.
