God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.">Matthew 22:32</a>). Now it was heard again in connection with the witness borne by the Apostles that He Himself had risen. (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-32.htm" title="Saying, I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold.">Acts 7:32</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Hath glorified his Son Jesus.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">Servant.</span> The word is that used throughout the later chanters of Isaiah for “the servant of Jehovah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-20.htm" title="Go you forth of Babylon, flee you from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare you, tell this, utter it even to the end of the earth; say you, The LORD has redeemed his servant Jacob.">Isaiah 48:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>).

Our Lord always spoke as having Almighty power, never hesitated to receive the greatest honour that was given to him on account of his Divine miracles. But the apostles referred all to their Lord, and refused to receive any honour, except as his undeserving instruments. This shows that Jesus was one with the Father, and co-equal with Him; while the apostles knew that they were weak, sinful men, and dependent for every thing on Jesus, whose power effected the cure. Useful men must be very humble. Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name, give glory. Every crown must be cast at the feet of Christ. The apostle showed the Jews the greatness of their crime, but would not anger or drive them to despair. Assuredly, those who reject, refuse, or deny Christ, do it through ignorance; but this can in no case be an excuse.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The God of Abraham - He is called the God of Abraham because Abraham acknowledged him as his God, and because God showed himself to be his friend. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-13.htm">Genesis 28:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-24.htm">Genesis 26:24</a>. It was important to show that it was the same God who had done this that had been acknowledged by their fathers, and that they were not about to introduce the worship of any other God. And it was especially important, because the promise had been made to Abraham that in his seed all the families of the earth would be blessed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-16.htm">Galatians 3:16</a>.<p>Hath glorified - Has honored. You denied, despised, and murdered him, but God has exalted and honored him. This miracle was done in the "name" of Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>. It was the "power of God" that had restored the man; and by putting forth this power, God had shown that he approved the work of his Son, and was disposed to honor him in the view of people.

Pilate was satisfied of his innocence; but he was weak, timid, and irresolute, and he yielded to their wishes. The fact that Pilate regarded him as innocent was a strong aggravation of their crime. They should have regarded him as innocent; but they urged on his condemnation against the deliberate judgment of him before whom they had arraigned him, and thus showed how obstinately they were resolved on his death. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

These titles and epithets of God, which are used in the Old Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-6.htm">Exodus 3:6</a> the apostle chooses to retain, partly to distinguish him from the gods of the Gentiles, and partly to show his regard to the God of Israel, the one, only true, and living God; and that, though he and his fellow apostles were preachers of Christ, yet they were not setters forth of another, or a strange God, but believed in the same God their forefathers did, and to whom they ascribe the glory of this miracle: <p>the God hath glorified his Son Jesus; by raising him from the dead, setting him at his own right hand, and giving him the gifts of the Spirit for men; which he having bestowed on the apostles, by virtue of this they wrought this miracle, which was a means of setting forth the glory of Christ, and of putting men upon glorifying him, or ascribing honour and glory to him. And in order to awaken their minds, to convict them of their sin, ingratitude, and folly, the apostle adds, <p>whom ye delivered up; to Pilate, the Roman governor; having first seized him as a thief, bound him as a malefactor, and arraigned, and condemned him to death in the high priest's palace as a blasphemer: <p>and denied him in the presence of Pilate; or "to", or "against the face of Pilate"; contrary to his sense of things, who more than once called him the King of the Jews, and wrote this as the superscription over him, when they denied him to be their King Messiah, and the Son of God, saying, they had no king but Caesar: <p>when he was determined to let him go; or release him; that is, "when he judged it right that he should be released", as the Syriac version renders it; for he never came to a point, to a resolution to let him go; though he thought it was but just and equitable that he should be dismissed, being, in his apprehension, an innocent man; and therefore pressed it on the people to agree to release him, to which he was himself strongly inclined. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Son Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-13.htm" title="The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus; whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let him go.">Acts 3:13</a>. <span class="ital">Connection:</span> Do not regard this cure as <span class="ital">our</span> work (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>); no, <span class="ital">God</span>, the peculiar God of our fathers, glorified (by this cure, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-3.htm" title="Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.">John 9:3</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-4.htm" title="And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 9:4</a>) His servant Jesus, whom you delivered up (what a stinging contrast!), etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πατέρων ἡμ</span>.] embraces the three patriarchs.

But further: if we bear in mind all that the “Servant of the Lord” must have meant for a Jew, and for a Jew so well versed in the O.T. Prophets as St. Peter, it becomes a marvellous fact that he should have seen in Jesus of Nazareth the realisation of a character and of a work so unique (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/49-1.htm" title="Listen, O isles, to me; and listen, you people, from far; The LORD has called me from the womb; from the bowels of my mother has he made mention of my name....">Isaiah 49:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-5.htm" title="And now, said the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and my God shall be my strength.">Isaiah 49:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-8.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of salvation have I helped you: and I will preserve you, and give you for a covenant of the people, to establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate heritages;">Isaiah 49:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/50-4.htm" title="The Lord GOD has given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: he wakens morning by morning, he wakens my ear to hear as the learned....">Isaiah 50:4-9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm" title="Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted and extolled, and be very high.">Isaiah 52:13</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-12.htm" title="Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he has poured out his soul to death: and he was numbered with the transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.">Isaiah 53:12</a>). For if we admit that the word “Servant” may be used, and is sometimes used, of the nation of Israel (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm" title="For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.">Isaiah 45:4</a>), and if we admit that some of the traits in the portrait of Jehovah’s “Servant” may have been suggested by the sufferings of individuals, and were applicable to individual sufferers, yet the portrait as a whole was one which transcended all experience, and the figure of the ideal Servant anticipated a work and a mission more enduring and comprehensive than that of Israel, and a holiness and innocency of life which the best of her sons had never attained (Driver, <span class="ital">Isaiah</span>, pp. 175–180). But not only in His miraculous working, but in His Resurrection and Ascension St. Peter recognised how God had glorified His Servant Jesus; and whilst it was natural that the word “Servant” should rise to his lips, as he recalls the submission to betrayal and death, whilst he never forgets the example of lowliness and obedience which Christ had given, and commends to poor Christian slaves the patience and humility of Him Who was “the first Servant in the world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_peter/2-18.htm" title="Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only to the good and gentle, but also to the fraudulent....">1 Peter 2:18-25</a>), he sees what prophets and wise men had failed to see, how the suffering “Servant” is also “the Prince of Life,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς μὲν</span>: there is no regular answering <span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> in the text (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a>), but the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-15.htm" title="And killed the Prince of life, whom God has raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.">Acts 3:15</a> <span class="greekheb">ὁ θεὸς ἤγειρεν</span> express the antithesis (Blass, Wendt, Holtzmann).

See <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-5.htm">2 Samuel 7:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-19.htm">2 Samuel 7:19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-20.htm">2 Samuel 7:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-21.htm">2 Samuel 7:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-26.htm">2 Samuel 7:26</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>. The term servant of Jehovah, or servant of the Lord, is applied in the Old Testament (1) to a worshipper of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/1-10.htm">Nehemiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-21.htm">Daniel 6:21</a>; so to Abraham, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/105-6.htm">Psalm 105:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-42.htm">Psalm 105:42</a>; to Joshua, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-29.htm">Joshua 24:29</a>; to Job, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-8.htm">Job 1:8</a>. (2) To a minister or ambassador of God called to any service, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>; of Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-6.htm">Jeremiah 27:6</a>; of the prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm">Amos 3:7</a>; of Moses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm">Deuteronomy 34:5</a>. (3) Peculiarly of the Messiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-13.htm">Isaiah 52:13</a>; as God's chosen servant for accomplishing the work of redemption. "Unless we render servant in the passages where the phrase &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; occurs in the New Testament, there will be no allusion throughout it all to that group of prophecies which designate the Messiah as the servant of Jehovah, who learned obedience by the things which he suffered" (Trench, "On the Authorized Version of the New Testament").<p>When he<p>He is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, the pronoun of more definite and emphatic reference, the latter, Pilate, "in order to make the contrast felt between what Pilate judged and what they did." This is further emphasized in the next verse. </body></html>
