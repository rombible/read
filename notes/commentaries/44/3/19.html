The use of the middle voice for “be converted,” gives the word the same force as in the “turn yourselves” of the older prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.">Ezekiel 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm" title="Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD.

The image that underlies the words (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-14.htm" title=" Blotting out the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, which was contrary to us, and took it out of the way, nailing it to his cross;">Colossians 2:14</a>) is that of an indictment which catalogues the sins of the penitent, and which the pardoning love of the Father cancels. The word and the thought are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-10.htm" title="Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.">Psalm 51:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm" title="I, even I, am he that blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and will not remember your sins.">Isaiah 43:25</a>.<p><span class= "bld">When the times of refreshing shall come.</span>—Better, “<span class= "ital">that so</span> the times of refreshing may come.” The Greek conjunction never has the force of “when.” The thought is that again expressed both by St. Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm" title="Looking for and hastening to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat?">2Peter 3:12</a>) and by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/11-25.htm" title="For I would not, brothers, that you should be ignorant of this mystery, lest you should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in.">Romans 11:25-27</a>); that the conversion of sinners, especially the conversion of Israel, will have a power to accelerate the fulfilment of God’s purposes, and, therefore, the coming of His kingdom in its completeness. The word for “refreshing” is not found elsewhere in the New Testament, but the cognate verb meets us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:">2Timothy 1:16</a>. In the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm" title="But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite, he hardened his heart, and listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:15</a>, it stands where we have “respite.” The “times of refreshing” are distinguished from the “restitution of all things” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-21.htm" title="Whom the heaven must receive until the times of restitution of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets since the world began.">Acts 3:21</a>, and would seem to be, as it were, the gracious preludes of that great consummation. The souls of the weary would be quickened as by the fresh breeze of morning; the fire of persecution assuaged as by “a moist whistling wind” (Song of the Three Children, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-24.htm" title="Yes, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold of these days.">Acts 3:24</a>). Israel, as a nation, did not repent, and therefore hatred and strife went on to the bitter end without refreshment. For every church, or nation, or family, those “times of refreshing” come as the sequel of a true conversion, and prepare the way for a more complete restoration.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord....">Acts 3:19-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Repent ye, therefore, </span>&c. — Let it, therefore, be your principal and immediate care to secure an interest in the benefits procured by his death; and in order thereto, repent of this and all your other iniquities; <span class="ital">and be converted </span>— That is, be turned from sin and Satan to God, (chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-20.htm" title="But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.">Acts 26:20</a>,) in the way of sincere and universal obedience. The term, <span class="ital">converted, </span>so common in modern writings, rarely occurs in Scripture, at least in the sense we now use it, for an entire change of heart and life. <span class="ital">That your sins may be blotted out </span>— That you may be delivered from the heavy burden of your guilt, and may obtain peace with God through the sacrifice and intercession of him you crucified; <span class="ital">when the times of refreshing shall come </span>— Rather, that they <span class="ital">may come; </span>times when God shall largely bestow his refreshing grace; <span class="ital">from the presence of the Lord </span>— To you also. To others, those times will assuredly come, whether ye repent or not. Erasmus and Piscator render this clause, <span class="ital">Seeing times of refreshment are come; </span>but the authorities produced in favour of this version seem not sufficient to justify it. The blotting out of the sins of penitents, however, was not deferred to any distant time, and divine refreshment would, no doubt, immediately follow a sense of pardon to them, attended with a lively hope of eternal felicity to succeed in due time. But “the following clause seems to intimate, that Peter apprehended the conversion of the Jews, as a people, would be attended with some extraordinary scene of prosperity and joy, and would open a speedy way to Christ’s descent from heaven, in order to the restitution of all things.” — Doddridge. <span class="ital">And he shall send </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">και αποστειλη</span>, <span class="ital">and that he may send; Jesus </span>— That, in consequence of your complying with this important counsel, you may not only be received to all the joys of a state of pardon and acceptance with God, but he may, at length, send unto you <span class="ital">Christ, which before was preached unto you </span>— By his disciples, both before and since his resurrection. But Tertullian, and several of the fathers, in quoting this passage, instead of <span class="greekheb">προκεκηρυγμενον</span>, <span class="ital">before preached, </span>read, <span class="greekheb">προκεχειρισμενον</span>, <span class="ital">before appointed; </span>that is, exhibited and set forth in a variety of types, and other symbols, namely, under the Old Testament dispensation, as the great Saviour of lost sinners. 1st, You shall have Christ in his spiritual presence; he that was sent into the world shall be sent to you, in and by his Spirit accompanying his word. The apostle meant, 2d, That God would send Christ to destroy the unbelieving and persecuting Jews, the enemies of God and his truth and cause, and so would deliver his true servants, both ministers and people, and give them a quiet possession of the gospel, with its privileges and blessings, which would be a time of refreshing to all that received it. <span class="ital">For then had the churches rest, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a>. So Dr. Hammond. There is also, 3dly, A reference in these words to the general conversion of the Jews, to take place after the fulness of the Gentiles is brought in, of which there are many express predictions and promises in the writings of the prophets, which, when it takes place, will be a time of refreshment indeed, both to them and the whole Church of Christ through all the world. <span class="ital">Whom the heavens must receive </span>— Whom you must not expect to appear immediately in person among you, for as he has ascended to heaven, he must remain there, <span class="ital">until the times of restitution of all things </span>— The long- expected happy times, when God will rectify all the seeming irregularities of his present dispensations, and make the cause of righteousness and truth for ever triumphant and glorious: <span class="ital">which God hath spoken of, </span>&c. — That is, concerning which great events (namely, that such a Saviour should be raised up, and should at length extend his righteous reign over all the world) <span class="ital">God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets </span>— That is, by the mouth of the generality of them; for the word <span class="greekheb">παντων</span>, <span class="ital">all, </span>is not found in some of the best MSS. and versions; <span class="ital">since the world began </span>— Since the beginning of time. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-70.htm" title="As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, which have been since the world began:">Luke 1:70</a>, where the same original phrase, <span class="greekheb">απ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">αιωνος</span>, occurs. In these times of restitution, the apostle here comprises at once the whole course of the time of the New Testament between our Lord’s ascension and his coming to glory. The most eminent of these times are the apostolic age, and that of the spotless church, which will consist of all the Jews and Gentiles united, after all persecutions and apostacies are at an end. It is well known that Dr. Thos. Burnet, Mr. Whiston, and some other learned writers, have urged this text in proof of a restoration of a paradisiacal state of the earth, which they have endeavoured to show will take place, but certainly without any clear warrant from Scripture; and this passage, in particular, may be so well explained of <span class="ital">regulating </span>the present disorders of the moral world, and the seeming inequalities of God’s providential dispensations, that it can with no propriety be pleaded in vindication of such an hypothesis. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:19-21 The absolute necessity of repentance is to be solemnly charged upon the consciences of all who desire that their sins may be blotted out, and that they may share in the refreshment which nothing but a sense of Christ's pardoning love can afford. Blessed are those who have felt this. It was not needful for the Holy Spirit to make known the times and seasons of these dispensations. These subjects are still left obscure. But when sinners are convinced of their sins, they will cry to the Lord for pardon; and to the penitent, converted, and believing, times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord. In a state of trial and probation, the glorified Redeemer will be out of sight, because we must live by faith in him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Repent ye - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>.<p>Therefore - Because of your sin in putting Jesus to death, and "because" he is the Messiah, and God through him is willing to show mercy to the chief of sinners.<p>And be converted - This expression conveys an idea not at all to be found in the original. It conveys the idea of "passivity," be "converted," as if they were to yield to some foreign influence I that they were now resisting. But the idea of being "passive" in this is not conveyed by the original word. The word means properly to "turn; to return to a path from which one has gone astray; and then to turn away from sins, or to forsake them." It is a word used in a general sense to denote "the whole turning to God." That the form of the word here &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;  epistrepsate does not denote passivity may be clearly seen by referring to the following places where the same form of the word is used: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-18.htm">Matthew 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-16.htm">Mark 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-31.htm">Luke 17:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-9.htm">1 Thessalonians 1:9</a>. The expression, therefore, would have been more appropriately rendered "repent and turn, that your sins," etc. "To be converted" cannot be a matter of obligation, but to "turn to God" is the duty of every sinner. The crimes of which he exhorted them to repent were those pertaining to the death of the Lord Jesus, as well as all the past sins of their lives. They were to turn from the course of wickedness in which they and the nation had been so long walking. That your sins, etc. In order that your sins may be forgiven. Sin cannot be pardoned before man repents of it. In the order of the work of grace, repentance must always precede pardon. Of course, no man can have evidence that his sin is pardoned until he repents. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm">Isaiah 1:16-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>.<p>May be blotted out - May be forgiven, or pardoned. The expression "to blot out sins" occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-25.htm">Isaiah 43:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-1.htm">Psalm 51:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm">Psalm 51:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-23.htm">Jeremiah 18:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/4-5.htm">Nehemiah 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-22.htm">Isaiah 44:22</a>. The expression "to blot out a name" is applied to expunging it from a "roll," or "catalog," or "list," as of an army, etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-19.htm">Deuteronomy 25:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>, etc. The expression to "blot out sins" is taken from the practice of creditors charging their debtors, and when the debt is paid, cancelling it, or wholly removing the record. The word used here properly refers to the practice of writing on tables covered with wax, and then by inverting the stylus, or instrument of writing, smoothing the wax again, and thus removing every trace of the record. This more entirely expresses the idea of pardoning than blotting does. It means wholly to remove the record, the charge, and every trace of the account against us. In this way God forgives sins.<p>When the times ... - The word &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  hopo&#772;s, rendered "when," is commonly rendered that, and denotes the "final cause," or the "reason" why a thing is done, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>, etc. By many it has been supposed to have this sense here, and to mean, "repent ...in order that the times of refreshing may come," etc. Thus, Kuinoel, Grotius, Lightfoot, the Syriac version, etc. If used in this sense, it means that their repentance and forgiveness would be the means of introducing peace and joy. Others have rendered it, in accordance with our translation, "when," meaning that they might find peace in the day when Christ should return to judgment, which return would be to them a day of rest, though of terror to the wicked. Thus, Calvin, Beza, the Latin Vulgate, Schleusner, etc. The grammatical construction will admit of either, though the former is more in accordance with the usual use of the word.<p>The objection to the former is, that it is not easy to see how their repenting, etc., would be the means of introducing the times of refreshing. And this, also, corresponds very little with the design of Peter in this discourse. That was to encourage them to repentance; to adduce arguments why they should repent, and why they might hope in his mercy. To do this, it was needful only to assure them that they were living under the times graciously promised by God the times of refreshing, when pardon might be obtained. The main inquiry, therefore, is, What did Peter refer to by the times of refreshing, and by the restitution of all things? Did he refer to any particular manifestation to be made then, or to the influence of the gospel on the earth, or to the future state, when the Lord Jesus shall come to judgment? The idea which I suppose Peter intended to convey was this: "Repent, and be converted. You have been great sinners, and are in danger. Turn from your ways, that your sins may be forgiven."<p>But then, what encouragement would there be for this? or why should it be done? Answer: "You are living under the times of the gospel, the reign of the Messiah, the times of refreshing. This happy, glorious period has been long anticipated, and is to continue to the close of the world. The period which will include the restitution of all things, and the return of Christ to judgment, has come, and is, therefore, the period when you may find mercy, and when you should seek it, to be prepared for his return." In this sense the passage refers to the fact that this time, this dispensation, this economy, including all this, had come, and they were living under it, and might and should seek for mercy. It expresses, therefore, the common belief of the Yews that such a time would come, and the comment of Peter about its nature and continuance. The belief of the Jews was that such times would come.<p>Peter affirms that the belief of such a period was well founded a time when mercy may be obtained. That time has come. The doctrine that it would come was well founded, and has been fulfilled. This was a reason why they should repent, and hope in the mercy of God. Peter goes on, then, to state further characteristics of that period. It would include the restitution of all things, the return of Christ to judgment, etc. And all this was an additional consideration why they should repent, and turn from their sins, and seek for forgiveness. The meaning of the passage may therefore be thus summed up: "Repent, since it is a true doctrine that such times would come: they are clearly predicted; they were to be expected; and you are now living under them. In these times; in this dispensation, also, God shall send his Son again to judge the world, and all things shall be closed and settled forever. Since you live under this period, you may seek for mercy, and you should seek to avoid the vengeance due to the wicked, and to be admitted to heaven when the Lord Jesus shall return."<p>Times of refreshing - The word rendered "refreshing," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  anapsuxis, means properly "breathing," or "refreshment," after being heated with labor, running, etc. It hence denotes "any kind of refreshment, as rest, or deliverance from evils of any kind." It is used nowhere else in the New Testament, except that the verb is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-16.htm">2 Timothy 1:16</a>, "Onesiphorus ...oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain." He administered comfort to me in my trials. It is used by the Septuagint in the Old Testament nine times: <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/8-15.htm">Exodus 8:15</a>, "But when Pharaoh saw that there was respite"; that is, cessation or rest from the plagues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-31.htm">Jeremiah 49:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-11.htm">Psalm 69:11</a>, etc. In no place in the Old Testament is the word applied to the terms of the gospel. The idea, however, that the times of the Messiah would be times of rest, ease, and prosperity, was a favorite one among the Jews, and was countenanced in the Old Testament. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-12.htm">Isaiah 28:12</a>, "To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the weary to rest; and this is the refreshing," etc. They anticipated the times of the gospel as a period when they would have rest from their enemies, a respite from the evils of oppression and war, and great national prosperity and peace. Under the idea that the happy times of the Messiah had come, Peter now addresses them, and assures them that they might obtain pardon and peace.<p>Shall come - This does not mean that this period was still future, for it had come; but that the expectation of the Jews that such a Messiah would come was well founded. A remarkably similar construction we have concerning Elijah <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm">Matthew 17:11</a>, "And Jesus answered and said, Elias truly shall first come, and restore," etc.; that is, the doctrine that Elijah would come was true, though he immediately adds that it had already taken place, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm">Acts 3:12</a>. See the notes on that place.<p>From the presence of the Lord - Greek: "From the face of the Lord." The expression means that God was "its author." From the face of the Lord means "from the Lord himself:" <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>, "I send thy messenger before thy face," that is, before thee. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-31.htm">Luke 2:31</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. when the times of refreshing shall come&#8212;rather, "in order that the times of refreshing may come"; that long period of repose, prosperity and joy, which all the prophets hold forth to the distracted Church and this miserable world, as eventually to come, and which is here, as in all the prophets, made to turn upon the national conversion of Israel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Repent ye therefore, and be converted; </span> this is the true end, use, and application, both of the preceding miracle and sermon, to persuade unto repentance and conversion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That your sins may be blotted out; </span> alluding to the manner of writing upon tables in those times, and not much disagreeing from what is in use amongst us, who write upon paper or parchment.

The Ethiopic version adds, "and be baptized"; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, <p>and be converted. The apostle's sense is, repent of the sin of crucifying Christ, which is what he had been charging them with, and turn unto him, and acknowledge him as the Messiah; receive his doctrines, and submit to his ordinances; externally reform in life and conversation, and bring forth fruits meet for repentance, such as will show it to be true and genuine: <p>that your sins may be blotted out; or forgiven, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-9.htm">Psalm 51:9</a>. Not that repentance and reformation procure the pardon of sin, or are the causes of it, for forgiveness is entirely owing to the free grace of God, and blood of Christ; but inasmuch as that is only manifested and applied to repenting and converted sinners; and who are encouraged to repent, and turn to the Lord from the promise of pardon; it is incumbent on them, and is their interest so to do, that they may have a discovery of the remission of their sins by the blood of Christ. Though no other repentance and conversion may be here meant than an external one; and the blotting out of sin, and forgiveness of it, may intend no other than the removing a present calamity, or the averting a threatened judgment, or the deliverance of persons from national ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>. These Jews had crucified the Lord of glory, and for this sin were threatened with miserable destruction; the apostle therefore exhorteth them to repentance for it, and to a conversion to the Messiah, that so when ruin should come upon their nation, they might be delivered from the general calamity; when it would be terrible times to the unbelieving and impenitent Jews, but times of refreshment, ease, peace, and rest from persecution, to the believers, as is next expressed. <p>When the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; or "that the times of refreshing may come", as the Syriac version; either seasons of spiritual refreshment, joy, and peace, through the great and precious promises of the Gospel, and by the application of the blood and righteousness of Christ, to such penitent and converted sinners; which refreshment and comfort come from the Lord, and are accompanied with his gracious presence: or else seasons of rest, and deliverance from the violent heat of persecution; which was the case of the saints at the destruction of Jerusalem; they were not only saved from that ruin, but delivered from the wrath of their most implacable enemies. The Ethiopic version renders it, "and the day of mercy shall come from the presence of the Lord", repenting sinners find mercy; and a discovery of pardon is a time of mercy; and when God grants this, he affords his presence. The Jews call the world to come a time of refreshment; and say (b), <p>"better is one hour  , "of refreshment", in the world to come, than the whole life of this world.'' <p>(b) Pirke Abot, c. 4. sect. 17. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.">Acts 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] infers from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-17.htm" title="And now, brothers, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers.">Acts 3:17</a> f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετανοήσατε</span>] see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm" title="Then Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.">Acts 2:38</a>.

But the context certainly conceives of Christ as enthroned in Heaven, where He must remain until His Second Advent, although we may readily admit that there is a spiritual presence of the enthroned Jesus which believers enjoy as a foretaste of the visible and glorious Presence at the Parousia, Briggs, <span class="ital">Messiah of the Apostles</span>, p. 31 ff.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ προσώπου τοῦ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπ</span>., lit[145], face, often used as here for “the presence”; <span class="ital">cf.</span> Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">מִפְּנֵי</span>, frequently in LXX, and see above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-28.htm" title="You have made known to me the ways of life; you shall make me full of joy with your countenance.">Acts 2:28</a>, here of the refreshment which comes from the bright and smiling presence of God to one seeking comfort (so Grimm).

The same word is well rendered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-21.htm" title="And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.">Acts 11:21</a>), “a great number believed and <span class="ital">turned</span> unto the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when the times of refreshing shall come</span>] <span class="greekheb">ὅπως ἂν</span> cannot be translated <span class="ital">when</span> the times … <span class="ital">shall come</span>, but <span class="ital">that</span> the times … <span class="ital">may come</span>. These particles indicate a purpose, the accomplishment of which still lies in doubt. So the Apostle’s argument is, Repent, that your sins may be blotted out, <span class="ital">that in this way</span> (i.e. by your penitence) the times of refreshing <span class="ital">may</span> come. The particles are rendered in this sense <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-17.htm" title="That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, on whom my name is called, said the Lord, who does all these things.">Acts 15:17</a>, “that the residue of men might [better <span class="ital">may</span>] seek after the Lord.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">times of refreshing</span>] The Greek word signifies “appointed times,” i.e. which God hath appointed and which He keeps in His own power, but which the penitence of men will hasten. They are called “times of refreshing,” i.e. peace and blessedness, for the Apostle describes them afterwards as the coming of the Christ. But by the prophecies which he quotes he shews that the refreshing is for those only who repent (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-23.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that every soul, which will not hear that prophet, shall be destroyed from among the people.">Acts 3:23</a></span>) and hear the prophet whom God sends. The anticipation of a speedy return of Christ from heaven was common among the first believers. St Peter here does not directly state this opinion, but we can see how current it was from St Paul’s second Epistle to the Thessalonians, where he finds it necessary to warn the Christians of that Church against the disquiet which the immediate expectation of the second Advent was causing among them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm" title="Repent you therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.">Acts 3:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μετανοήσατε οὖν καὶ ἐπιστρέψατε</span>, <span class="ital">repent therefore and be converted</span>) Here, and in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-20.htm" title="But showed first to them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance.">Acts 26:20</a>, <span class="ital">repentance</span> is put before <span class="ital">conversion</span>; whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-19.htm" title="Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after that I was instructed, I smote on my thigh: I was ashamed, yes, even confounded, because I did bear the reproach of my youth.">Jeremiah 31:19</a>, <span class="ital">conversion</span> is put before <span class="ital">repentance</span>, “Surely after that I was <span class="ital">turned</span> (converted), I <span class="ital">repented</span>.” <span class="ital">Conversion</span> is put first, when there is signified the recovery of a man from sin and the return to his right mind [senses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-17.htm" title="And when he came to himself, he said, How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger!">Luke 15:17</a>]: it is put after <span class="ital">repentance</span>, when there is signified in the person repenting the applying of himself to GOD.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ ἐξαλειφθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">that</span> your sins <span class="ital">may be blotted out</span>) The allusion is to the <span class="ital">water</span> of baptism.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς ἁμαρτίας</span>, <span class="ital">your sins</span>) even that sin which ye perpetrated against Jesus,—<span class="greekheb">ὅπως ἂν</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) [“when”].

Those days are delayed by the unbelief of Israel. <span class="cmt_word">Seasons of refreshing</span>. The A.V." times of refreshing" is manifestly right, though there is no article in the Greek. "Seasons of refreshing" seems very vague and vapid (see Alford, 1:1, who very appropriately and conclusively cites the phrase <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, "the times of the Gentiles"(<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-24.htm">Luke 21:24</a>).
