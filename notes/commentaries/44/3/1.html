They were probably about the same age (the idea that Peter was some years older than John rests mainly on the pictures which artists have drawn from their imagination, and has no evidence in Scripture), and had been friends from their youth upward. They had been partners as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm" title="And so was also James, and John, the sons of Zebedee, which were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not; from now on you shall catch men.">Luke 5:10</a>). They had been sharers in looking for the consolation of Israel, and had together received the baptism of John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>). John and Andrew had striven which should be the first to tell Peter that they had found the Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-41.htm" title="He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.">John 1:41</a>). The two had been sent together to prepare for the Passover (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm" title="And he sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare us the passover, that we may eat.">Luke 22:8</a>). John takes Peter into the palace of the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-16.htm" title="But Peter stood at the door without. Then went out that other disciple, which was known to the high priest, and spoke to her that kept the door, and brought in Peter.">John 18:16</a>), and though he must have witnessed his denials is not estranged from him. It is to John that Peter turns for comfort after his fall, and with him he comes to the sepulchre on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-6.htm" title="Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie,">John 20:6</a>). The eager affection which, now more strongly than ever, bound the two together is seen in Peter’s question, “Lord, and what shall this man do?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-21.htm" title="Peter seeing him said to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?">John 21:21</a>); and now they are again sharers in action and in heart, in teaching and in worship. Passing rivalries there may have been, disputes which was the greatest, prayers for places on the right hand and the left (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm" title="And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, come to him, saying, Master, we would that you should do for us whatever we shall desire.">Mark 10:35</a>); but the idea maintained by Renan (<span class= "ital">Vie de Jésus, Introduction</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>that St. John wrote his Gospel to exalt himself at the expense of Peter, must take its place among the <span class= "ital">delirantium somnia, </span>the morbid imaginations, of inventive interpretation. They appear in company again in the mission to Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm" title="Now when the apostles which were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John:">Acts 8:14</a>), and in recognising the work that had been done by Paul and Barnabas among the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>). When it was that they parted never to meet again, we have no record. No account is given as to the interval that had passed since the Day of Pentecost. Presumably the brief notice at the end of Acts 2 was meant to summarise a gradual progress, marked by no striking incidents, which may have gone on for several months. The absence of chronological <span class= "ital">data</span> in the Acts, as a book written by one who in the Gospel appears to lay stress on such matters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-2.htm" title="And certain of the Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath days?">Luke 6:2</a>), is somewhat remarkable. The most natural explanation is that he found the informants who supplied him with his facts somewhat uncertain on these points, and that, as a truthful historian, he would not invent dates.<p><span class= "bld">At the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour</span>—<span class= "ital">sc.</span>, 3 P.M., the hour of the evening sacrifice (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xiv. 4, § 3). The traditions of later Judaism had fixed the third, the sixth, and the ninth hours of each day as times for private prayer. Daniel’s practice of praying three times a day seems to imply a rule of the same kind, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm" title="Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud: and he shall hear my voice.">Psalm 55:17</a> (“evening and morning and at noon will I pray”) carries the practice up to the time of David. “Seven times a day” was, perhaps, the rule of those who aimed at a life of higher devotion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-164.htm" title="Seven times a day do I praise you because of your righteous judgments.">Psalm 119:164</a>). Both practices passed into the usage of the Christian Church certainly as early as the second century, and probably therefore in the first. The <span class= "ital">three</span> hours were observed by many at Alexandria in the time of Clement (<span class= "ital">Strom, </span>vii. p. 722). The seven became the “canonical hours” of Western Christendom, the term first appearing in the Rule of St. Benedict (<span class= "ital">ob.</span> A.D. 542) and being used by Bede (A.D. 701).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/acts/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘THEN SHALL THE LAME MAN LEAP AS AN HART’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘Many wonders and signs were done by the Apostles’ {<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-43.htm" title="And fear came on every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.">Acts 2:43</a>}, but this one is recorded in detail, both because it was conspicuous as wrought in the Temple, and because it led to weighty consequences. The narrative is so vivid and full of minute particulars that it suggests an eye-witness. Was Peter Luke’s informant? The style of the story is so like that of Mark’s Gospel that we might reasonably presume so.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The scene and the persons are first set before us. It was natural that a close alliance should be cemented between Peter and John, both because they were the principal members of the quartet which stood first among the Apostles, and because they were so unlike each other, and therefore completed each other. Peter’s practical force and eye for externals, and John’s more contemplative nature and eye for the unseen, needed one another. So we find them together in the judgment hall, at the sepulchre, and here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They ‘went up to the Temple,’ or, to translate more exactly and more picturesquely, ‘were going up,’ when the incident to be recorded stayed them. They had passed through the court, and came to a gate leading into the inner court, which was called ‘Beautiful.’ from its artistic excellence, when they were arrested by the sight of a lame beggar, who had been carried there every day for many years to appeal, by the display of his helplessness, to the entering worshippers. Precisely similar sights may be seen to-day at the doors of many a famous European church and many a mosque. He mechanically wailed out his formula, apparently scarcely looking at the two strangers, nor expecting a response. Long habit and many rebuffs had not made him hopeful, but it was his business to ask, and so he asked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Some quick touch of pity shot through the two friends’ hearts, which did not need to be spoken in order that each might feel it to be shared by the other. So they paused, and, as was in keeping with their characters, Peter took speech in hand, while John stood by assenting. Purposed devotion is well delayed when postponed in order to lighten misery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There must have been something magnetic in Peter’s voice and steady gaze as he said, ‘Look on us!’ It was a strange preface, if only some small coin was to follow. It kindled some flicker of hope of he knew not what in the beggar. He expected to receive ‘something’ from them, and, no doubt, was asking himself what. Expectation and receptivity were being stirred in him, though he could not divine what was coming. We have no right to assume that his state of mind was operative in fitting him to be cured, nor to call his attitude ‘faith,’ but still he was lifted from his usual dreary hopelessness, and some strange anticipation was creeping into his heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Then comes the grand word of power. Again Peter is spokesman, but John takes part, though silently. With a fixed gaze, which told of concentrated purpose, and went to the lame man’s heart, Peter triumphantly avows what most men are ashamed of, and try to hide: ‘Silver and gold have I none.’ He had ‘left all and followed Christ’; he had not made demands on the common stock. Empty pockets may go along with true wealth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is a fine flash of exultant confidence in Peter’s next words, which is rather spoiled by the Authorised Version. He did not say ‘<span class="ital">such</span> as I have,’ as it it was inferior to money, which he had not, but he said ‘<span class="ital">what</span> I have’ {Rev. Ver.},-a very different tone. The expression eloquently magnifies the power which he possessed as far more precious than wealth, and it speaks of his assurance that he did possess it-an assurance which rested, not only on his faith in his Lord’s promise and gift, but on his experience in working former miracles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> How deep his words go into the obligations of possession! ‘What I have I give’ should be the law for all Christians in regard to all that they have, and especially in regard to spiritual riches. God gives us these, not only in order that we may enjoy them ourselves, but in order that we may impart, and so in our measure enter into the joy of our Lord and know the greater blessedness of giving than of receiving. How often it has been true that a poor church has been a miracle-working church, and that, when it could not say ‘Silver and gold have I none’ it has also lost the power of saying, ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk’!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The actual miracle is most graphically narrated. With magnificent boldness Peter rolls out his Master’s name, there, in the court of the Temple, careless who may hear. He takes the very name that had been used in scorn, and waves it like a banner of victory. His confidence in his possession of power was not confidence in himself, but in his Lord. When we can peal forth the Name with as much assurance of its miracle-working power as Peter did, we too shall be able to make the lame walk. A faltering voice is unworthy to speak such words, and will speak them in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The process of cure is minutely described. Peter put out his hand to help the lame man up, and, while he was doing so, power came into the shrunken muscles and weak ankles, so that the cripple felt that he could raise himself, and, though all passed in a moment, the last part of his rising was his own doing, and what began with his being ‘lifted up’ ended in his ‘leaping up.’ Then came an instant of standing still, to steady himself and make sure of his new strength, and then he began to walk.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The interrupted purpose of devotion could now be pursued, but with a gladsome addition to the company. How natural is that ‘walking and leaping and praising God’! The new power seemed so delightful, so wonderful, that sober walking did not serve. It was a strange way of going into the Temple, but people who are borne along by the sudden joy of new gifts beyond hope need not be expected to go quietly, and sticklers for propriety who blamed the man’s extravagance, and would have had him pace along with sober gait and downcast eyes, like a Pharisee, did not know what made him thus obstreperous, even in his devout thankfulness. ‘Leaping and praising God’ do make a singular combination, but before we blame, let us be sure that we understand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> One of the old manuscripts inserts a clause which brings out more clearly that there was a pause, during which the three remained in the Temple in prayer. It reads, ‘And when Peter and John came out, he came out with them, holding them, and they [the people] being astonished, stood in the porch,’ etc. So we have to think of the buzzing crowd, waiting in the court for their emergence from the sanctuary. Solomon’s porch was, like the Beautiful gate, on the east side of the Temple enclosure, and may probably have been a usual place of rendezvous for the brethren, as it had been a resort of their Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It was a great moment, and Peter, the unlearned Galilean, the former cowardly renegade, rose at once to the occasion. Truly it was given him in that hour what to speak. His sermon is distinguished by its undaunted charging home the guilt of Christ’s death on the nation, its pitying recognition of the ignorance which had done the deed, and its urgent entreaty. We here deal with its beginning only. ‘Why marvel ye at this?’-it would have been a marvel if they had not marvelled. The thing was no marvel to the Apostle, because he believed that Jesus was the Christ and reigned in Heaven. Miracles fall into their place and become supremely ‘natural’ when we have accepted that great truth.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fervent disavowal of their ‘own power or holiness’ as concerned in the healing is more than a modest disclaimer. It leads on to the declaration of who is the true Worker of all that is wrought for men by the hands of Christians. That disavowal has to be constantly repeated by us, not so much to turn away men’s admiration or astonishment from us, as to guard our own foolish hearts from taking credit for what it may please Jesus to do by us as His tools.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The declaration of Christ as the supreme Worker is postponed till after the solemn indictment of the nation. But the true way to regard the miracle is set forth at once, as being God’s glorifying of Jesus. Peter employs a designation of our Lord which is peculiar to these early chapters of Acts. He calls Him God’s ‘Servant,’ which is a quotation of the Messianic title in the latter part of Isaiah, ‘the Servant of the Lord.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The fiery speaker swiftly passes to contrast God’s glorifying with Israel’s rejection. The two points on which he seizes are noteworthy. ‘Ye delivered Him up’; that is, to the Roman power. That was the deepest depth of Israel’s degradation. To hand over their Messiah to the heathen,-what could be completer faithlessness to all Israel’s calling and dignity? But that was not all: ‘ye denied Him.’ Did Peter remember some one else than the Jews who had done the same, and did a sudden throb of conscious fellowship even in that sin make his voice tremble for a moment? Israel’s denial was aggravated because it was ‘in the presence of Pilate,’ and had overborne his determination to release his prisoner. The Gentile judge would rise in the judgment to condemn them, for he had at least seen that Jesus was innocent, and they had hounded him on to an illegal killing, which was murder as laid to his account, but national apostasy as laid to theirs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> These were daring words to speak in the Temple to that crowd. But the humble fisherman had been filled with the Spirit, who is the Strengthener, and the fear of man was dead in him. If we had never heard of Pentecost, we should need to invent something of the sort to make intelligible the transformation of these timid folk, the first disciples, into heroes. A dead Christ, lying in an unknown grave, could never have inspired His crushed followers with such courage, insight, and elastic confidence and gladness in the face of a frowning world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm" title="Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.">Acts 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now Peter and John, </span>&c. — We are not informed when the fact here recorded took place; but it is probable it was during the days of the feast of pentecost, and while the city was still full of people; <span class="ital">went up to the temple </span>— Probably to seek an opportunity of preaching to the people, as well as to offer up their prayers and supplications there before God; <span class="ital">at the ninth hour </span>— One of the solemn hours of prayer.

The third hour, therefore, was nine in the morning; the ninth three in the afternoon, but not exactly. For the third was the middle space between sunrise and noon; which, if the sun rose at five, (the earliest hour of its rising in that climate,) was half an hour after eight; if at seven, (the latest hour of its rising there,) was half an hour after nine. The chief hours of prayer were the third and ninth; at which seasons the morning and evening sacrifices were offered, and incense (a kind of emblem representing prayer) burnt on the golden altar.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 The apostles and the first believers attended the temple worship at the hours of prayer. Peter and John seem to have been led by a Divine direction, to work a miracle on a man above forty years old, who had been a cripple from his birth. Peter, in the name of Jesus of Nazareth, bade him rise up and walk. Thus, if we would attempt to good purpose the healing of men's souls, we must go forth in the name and power of Jesus Christ, calling on helpless sinners to arise and walk in the way of holiness, by faith in Him. How sweet the thought to our souls, that in respect to all the crippled faculties of our fallen nature, the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth can make us whole! With what holy joy and rapture shall we tread the holy courts, when God the Spirit causes us to enter therein by his strength!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Peter and John went up ... - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>, it is said that the apostles were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, it is clear that all the disciples were accustomed daily to resort to the temple for devotion. Whether they joined in the sacrifices of the temple-service is not said; but the thing is not improbable. This was the place and the manner in which they and their fathers had worshipped. They came slowly to the conclusion that they were to leave the temple, and they would naturally resort there with their countrymen to worship the God of their fathers. In the previous chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-43.htm">Acts 2:43</a> we are told in general that many wonders and signs were done by the hands of the apostles. From the many miracles which were performed, Luke selects one of which he gives a more full account, and especially as it gives him occasion to record another of the addresses of Peter to the Jews. An impostor would have been satisfied with the general statement that many miracles were performed. The sacred writers descend to particulars, and tell us where, and in relation to whom, they were performed. This is a proof that they were honest people, and did not intend to deceive.<p>Into the temple - Not into the edifice properly called the temple, but into the court of the temple, where prayer was accustomed to be made.

These two disciples were intimate companions, and great lovers of each other; they were often together: they are thought, by some, to have been together in the high priest's palace at the trial of Christ; and they ran together to his sepulchre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a> and they now went together to the temple, not to attend the daily sacrifice, which was now abolished by the sacrifice of Christ, but to attend to the duty of prayer, which was still in force, and that they might have an opportunity of preaching Christ, where there was a number of people together: <p>at the hour of prayer; being the ninth hour, or three o'clock in the afternoon. This was one of their hours of prayer; it was customary with the Jews to pray three times a day, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-10.htm">Daniel 6:10</a> which, according to the Psalmist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-17.htm">Psalm 55:17</a> were evening, morning, and at noon; to which seems to answer the three times that are taken notice of by Luke in this history: that in the morning was at the third hour, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-15.htm">Acts 2:15</a> or nine o'clock in the morning; that at noon was at the sixth hour, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9</a> or twelve o'clock at noon; and that in the evening at the ninth hour, as here, or three o'clock in the afternoon. Not that these were times of divine appointment. The Jews (o) themselves say, <p>"there is no number of prayers from the law, and there is no repetition of this or that prayer from the law, and there is no , "fixed time" for prayer from the law.'' <p>But according to the traditions of the elders, <p>"the morning prayer was to the end of the fourth hour, which is the third part of the day--the prayer of the "Minchah", (or evening prayer,) they fixed the time of it to answer to the evening daily sacrifice; and because the daily sacrifice was offered up every day from the ninth hour and a half, they ordered the time of it to be from the ninth hour and a half, and it is called the lesser "Minchah"; and because in the evening of the passover, which falls upon the evening of the sabbath, they slay the daily sacrifice at the sixth hour and a half, they say, that he that prays after the sixth hour and a half is excused; and after this time is come, the time to which he is obliged is come, and this is called the great "Minchah"---lo, you learn, that the time of the great "Minchah" is from the sixth hour and a half, to the ninth hour and a half; and the time of the lesser "Minchah" is from the ninth hour and a half, until there remains of the day an hour and a quarter; and it is lawful to pray it until the sun sets.'' <p>So that it was at the time of the lesser "Minchah" that Peter and John went up to the temple; which seems to be not on the same day of Pentecost, but on some day, or days after; it may be the sabbath following, when there was a great number of people got together. <p>(o) Maimon.

Page renders “for, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to be there at the hour” (so Felten, Lumby). In going thus to the Temple they imitated their Master, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-55.htm" title="In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are you come out as against a thief with swords and staves for to take me?

Edersheim points out that although the evening sacrifice was fixed by the Jews as “between the evenings,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, between the darkness of the gloaming and that of the night, and although the words of Psalms 134, and the appointment of Levite singers for night service, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-33.htm" title="And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they were employed in that work day and night.">1 Chronicles 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-30.htm" title="And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and likewise at even:">1 Chronicles 23:30</a>, seem to imply an evening service, yet in the time of our Lord the evening sacrifice commenced much earlier, <span class="ital">The Temple; its Ministry and Services</span>, pp. 115, 116. According to Schürer, followed by Blass who appeals to the authority of Hamburger, there is no ground for supposing that the third, sixth, and ninth hours of the day were regular stated times for prayer. The actual times were rather (1) early in the morning at the time of the morning sacrifice (see also Edersheim, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 115); (2) in the afternoon about the ninth hour (three o’clock), at the time of the evening sacrifice; (3) in the evening at sunset (<span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. i., 290, E.T.). The third, sixth, and ninth hours were no doubt appropriated to private prayer, and some such rule might well have been derived from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-7.htm" title="See, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.

The hour of morning prayer was the third hour, and Peter went up to the housetop to pray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a>) about the sixth hour, which was noon, and the evening prayer was this to which Peter and John were going up.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">being the ninth hour</span>] At the Equinox this would be three o’clock in the afternoon, but when the daylight was longer it would be later, so that if there were 18 hours day and 6 hours of darkness, each hour of the day would be an hour and a half long, and the hours of the night only half an hour each.

[This is our three o’clock in the afternoon. He who would accustom himself to collect his thoughts at that time, and to apply himself to (to find time for) prayer, would derive no common profit from the practice. There is no difference as to time, regarded in itself. But it is a proof of choice obedience to cut short or interrupt labour, when we are in the height of business, for such a purpose. It was about mid-day that Peter prayed in private: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm" title="On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:">Acts 10:9</a>.—V. g.]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[25] Lachm., after the oldest MSS.

Peter and John. The close friendship of these two apostles is remarkable. The origin of it appears to have been their partnership in the fishing-boats in which they pursued their trade as fishermen on the Sea of Galilee. For St. Luke tells us that the sons of Zebedee were "partners with Simon," and helped him to take the miraculous draught of fishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-10.htm">Luke 5:10</a>). We find the two sons of Zebedee associated with Peter in the inner circle of the Lord's apostles, at the Transfiguration, at the raising of Jairus's daughter, and at the agony in the Garden of Gethsemane (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-3.htm">Mark 13:3</a>). But the yet closer friendship of Peter and John first appears in their going together to the palace of Caiaphas on the night of the betrayal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-15.htm">John 18:15</a>), and then in the memorable visit to the holy sepulcher on the morning of the Resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-2.htm">John 20:2-4</a>), and yet again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-7.htm">John 21:7, 20, 21</a>. It is in strict and natural sequence to these indications in the Gospel that, on opening the first chapters of the Acts, we find Peter and John constantly acting together in the very van of the Christian army (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-1.htm">Acts 3:1, 3, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-13.htm">Acts 4:13, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-14.htm">Acts 8:14, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The hour of prayer</span>; called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-10.htm">Luke 1:10</a>, "the hour of incense," that is, the hour of the evening sacrifice, when the people stood outside in prayer, while the priest within offered the sacrifice and burnt the incense (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm">Acts 2:46</a>, note). Hence the comparison in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-2.htm">Psalm 141:2</a>, "Let my prayer be set before thee as incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Went up (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>The imperfect: were going up.
