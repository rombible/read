As the words stand, taken with their context, they seem to point to the appearance of a succession of true prophets as contrasted with the diviners of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-14.htm" title="For these nations, which you shall possess, listened to observers of times, and to diviners: but as for you, the LORD your God has not suffered you so to do.">Deuteronomy 18:14</a>; and, even with St. Peter’s interpretation before us, we may well admit those prophets as primary and partial fulfilments of them. But the words had naturally fixed the minds of men on the coming of some one great prophet who should excel all others, and we find traces of that expectation in the question put to the Baptist, “Art thou the prophet?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm" title="And they asked him, What then?

Moses instituted the Jewish Church: Christ instituted the Christian. With the prophesying of Moses was soon joined the effect, the deliverance of Israel from Egypt: with the prophesying of Christ, that grand effect, the deliverance of his people from sin and death. Those who could not bear the voice of God, yet desired to hear that of Moses: much more do those who are wearied with the law, desire to hear the voice of Christ. Moses spake to the people all and only those things which God commanded him: so did Christ. Some other instances of similarity between Moses and Jesus, mentioned by the late Mr. Fletcher, in his letters to Dr. Priestley, are as follows: “Was the son of Amram saved in his infancy from the cruelty of a jealous tyrant, who had doomed him to die with a multitude of other children? So was the son of Mary. Was Moses the lawgiver of the Jews? So is Christ the legislator of the Christians. Was Moses remarkable for his meekness? So was He who says, <span class="ital">Learn of me, for I am meek in heart. </span>Both, being appointed as mediating prophets, stood in the gap to turn away the wrath of Heaven from a guilty people. Both, as shepherds of the Lord, led his straying sheep through a wilderness to a delightful land. Did Moses smite Pharaoh, king of Egypt; Sihon, king of the Amorites; and Og, king of Bashan? so will Christ <span class="ital">wound kings in the day of his wrath. </span>Did Moses heal the dying Israelites, by lifting up the serpent in the wilderness? so Christ heals believers, by being lifted up on the cross. Did Moses fast forty days, and receive the law on mount Sinai? so did Jesus fast forty days, and deliver his law on a mountain of Galilee. Was Moses rejected and almost stoned by the Israelites? so was Christ, by the Jews. Did Moses despise the glory of Egypt, that he might suffer for, and with, the people of God? so did our Lord despise all the kingdoms of the world, and the glory of them, that he might suffer for, and with, his people. In a word, Is Moses the great prophet of the Old Testament? so is Christ of the New.” But, though Christ was like Moses in these respects, yet was he infinitely superior to him in person as well as in office: he <span class="ital">was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, </span>as the author of the epistle to the Hebrews asserts, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-3.htm" title="For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who has built the house has more honor than the house....">Hebrews 3:3-6</a>,) especially on two capital accounts: “1st, Moses was faithful as a <span class="ital">servant in the house of him who had appointed him: but Christ </span>was faithful <span class="ital">as a Son over his own house. </span>2d, Moses was worthy of glory, inasmuch as he was a fundamental stone in the house of God; but Christ is worthy of <span class="ital">more glory, inasmuch as he who builded the house hath more honour than the house, </span>or any part of it; for <span class="ital">every house is built by some man, </span>but <span class="ital">he who builded </span>the Jewish Church, and <span class="ital">all things, </span>which Christ did, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-3.htm" title="All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.">John 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-16.htm" title=" For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:">Colossians 1:16</a>,) <span class="ital">is God.” </span>See Fletcher’s Works, vol. 4. pp. 517, 518, Amer. 8vo. edit. <span class="ital">Him shall ye hear </span>— Him shall ye regard with obedient reverence; <span class="ital">in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you </span>— Persuaded of the certain truth and infinite importance of his doctrine; <span class="ital">and every soul </span>that <span class="ital">will not hear that Prophet </span>— And be directed by his words; <span class="ital">shall be destroyed from among the people </span>— Shall be made an example of the severest punishment, due to so much aggravated and ungrateful rebellion. One cannot imagine a more masterly address than this, to warn the Jews of the dreadful consequence of their infidelity, in the very words of their favourite prophet, out of a pretended zeal for whom they had rejected Christ.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-26 Here is a powerful address to warn the Jews of the dreadful consequences of their unbelief, in the very words of Moses, their favourite prophet, out of pretended zeal for whom they were ready to reject Christianity, and to try to destroy it. Christ came into the world to bring a blessing with him. And he sent his Spirit to be the great blessing. Christ came to bless us, by turning us from our iniquities, and saving us from our sins. We, by nature cleave to sin; the design of Divine grace is to turn us from it, that we may not only forsake, but hate it. Let none think that they can be happy by continuing in sin, when God declares that the blessing is in being turned from all iniquity. Let none think that they understand or believe the gospel, who only seek deliverance from the punishment of sin, but do not expect happiness in being delivered from sin itself. And let none expect to be turned from their sin, except by believing in, and receiving Christ the Son of God, as their wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Moses truly said - The authority of Moses among the Jews was absolute and final. It was of great importance, therefore, to show not only that they were not departing from his Law, but that he had actually foretold these very things. The object of the passage is not to prove that the heavens must receive him, but that he was truly the Messiah.<p>Unto the fathers - To their ancestors, or the founders of the nation. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-19</a>.<p>A Prophet - Literally, one who foretells future events. But it is also used to denote a religious teacher in general. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>. In the passage in Deuteronomy it is evidently used in a large sense, to denote one who would infallibly guide and direct the nation in its religious affairs; one who would be commissioned by God to do this, in opposition to the diviners <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a> on which other nations relied. The meaning of this passage in Deuteronomy is apparent from the connection. Moses is stating to the Hebrews Act 3:1-8 the duty and office of the priests and Levites. He then cautions them against conforming to the surrounding nations, particularly on the subject of religious instruction and guidance. They, said he, consult, in times of perplexity, with enchanters, and charmers, and necromancers, and wizards, etc. <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-11.htm">Acts 3:11-14</a>, but it shall not be so with you. You shall not be left to this false and uncertain guidance in times of perplexity and danger, for the Lord will raise up, from time to time, a prophet, a man directly commissioned in an extraordinary manner from heaven, like me, who shall direct and counsel you. The promise, therefore, pertains to the serges or, prophets which God would raise up; or it is a promise that God would send his prophets, as occasion might demand, to instruct and counsel the nation. The design was to keep them from consulting with diviners, etc., and to preserve them from following the pretended and false religious teachers of surrounding idolatrous people. In this interpretation most commentators agree. See particularly "Calvin" on this place. Thus explained, the prophecy had no "exclusive" or even "direct" reference to the Messiah, and there is no evidence that the Jews understood it to have any such reference, except as one of the series of prophets that God would raise up and send to instruct the nation. If, then, it be asked on what principle Peter appealed to this, we may reply:<p>(1) That the Messiah was to sustain the character of a prophet, and the prophecy had reference to him as one of the teachers that God would raise up to instruct the nation.<p>(2) it would apply to him by way of eminence, as the greatest of the messengers that God would send to instruct the people. In this sense it is probable that the Jews would understand it.<p>(3) this was one of those emergencies in the history of the nation when they might expect such an intervention. The prophecy implied that in times of perplexity and danger God would raise up such a prophet. Such a time then existed. The nation was corrupt, distracted, subjected to a foreign power, and needed such a teacher and guide. If it be asked why Peter appealed to this rather than to explicit prophecies of the Messiah, we may remark:<p>(1) That his main object was to show their guilt in having rejected him and put him to death, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14-15</a>.<p>(2) that in order to do this, he sets before them clearly the obligation to obey him; and in doing this, appeals to the express command of Moses. He shows them that, according to Moses, whoever would not obey such a prophet should be cut off from among the people. In refusing, therefore, to hear this great prophet, and putting him to death, they had violated the express command of their own Lawgiver. But it was possible still to obey him, for he still lived in heaven; and all the authority of Moses, therefore, made it a matter of obligation for them still to hear and obey him. The Jews were accustomed to apply the name prophet to the Messiah <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-11.htm">Matthew 21:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/4-24.htm">Luke 4:24</a>, and it has been shown from the writings of the Jewish rabbis that they believed the Messiah would be the greatest of the prophets, even greater than Moses. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>.<p>The Lord your God - In the Hebrew, "Yahweh, thy God. "Raise up unto you." Appoint, or commission to come to you.<p>Of your brethren - Among yourselves; of your own countrymen; so that you shall not be dependent on foreigners, or on teachers of other nations. All the prophets were native-born Jews. And it was particularly true of the Messiah that he was to be a Jew, descended from Abraham, and raised up from the midst of his brethren, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-11.htm">Hebrews 2:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-16.htm">Hebrews 2:16-17</a>. On this account it was to be presumed that they would feel a deeper interest in him, and listen more attentively to his instructions.<p>Like unto me - Not in all things, but only in the point which was under discussion. He was to resemble him in being able to make known to them the will of God, and thus preventing the necessity of looking to other teachers. The idea of resemblance between Moses and the prophet is not very strictly expressed in the Greek, except in the mere circumstance of being raised up. God shall raise up to you a prophet as he has raised up me - &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c2;  ho&#772;s &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;  eme. The resemblance between Moses and the Messiah should not be pressed too far. The Scriptures have not traced it further than to the fact that both were raised up by God to communicate his will to the Jewish people, and therefore one should be heard as well as the other.<p>Him shall ye hear - That is, him shall you obey, or you shall receive his instructions as a communication from God.<p>In all things, whatsoever ... - These words are not quoted literally from the Hebrew, but they express the sense of what is said in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-26. a prophet &#8230; like unto me&#8212;particularly in intimacy of communication with God (Nu 12:6-8), and as the mediatorial Head of a new order of things (Heb 3:2-6).

The Jewish fathers, the Israelites in the times of Moses. The Ethiopic version reads, "our fathers". This phrase, "unto the fathers", is left out in the Vulgate Latin and Syriac versions, and in the Alexandrian copy: the passages referred to are in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a><p>a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you: which is not to be understood of a succession of prophets, as some of the Jewish writers (c) think; for the Jews never had a constant succession of prophets, and those they had, were not like to Moses: but of a single prophet, and so the Targums or Onkelos and Jonathan understood it; but not to be applied to Joshua, as some (d), or to Jeremiah (e) as others, or to David (f); but to the Messiah, and which is the Lord Jesus Christ, who answers to all the characters: he was a prophet in every sense, who brought a revelation of the divine will, taught the way, and explained the Scriptures of truth perfectly, and foretold things to come; he was raised up by the Lord God of Israel, and was anointed by his Spirit, and sent by him, and that to the people of the Jews, to the lost sheep of the house of Israel; he was the minister of the circumcision: <p>of your brethren; in the Hebrew text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> it is also said, "out of the midst of thee"; but as these phrases are synonymous, the apostle here only retains one of them, which suggests that this prophet, the Messiah, should be of Jewish extract; as Jesus was, of the seed of David, and a son of Abraham: <p>like unto me; that is, to Moses, who is, the person speaking, between whom and Christ there is an agreement; the law was given by Moses, and the Gospel came by Christ; Moses was a mediator between God and the people of Israel, and Christ is the Mediator between God and men; Moses, under God, was an instrument of redeeming the people of Israel out of Egypt, and Christ, he is the Redeemer of his people from sin, Satan, and the law, and all their enemies: the Jews (g) have a common saying, <p>"as was the first Redeemer, so shall be the last Redeemer;'' <p>and they moreover observe (h), that, <p>"as Israel was redeemed in the month Nisan, so they shall be redeemed in the month Nisan;'' <p>in the future redemption by the Messiah: let the Jews abide by this; the Messiah Jesus suffered in the month Nisan, and obtained eternal redemption for his people: one of their (i) writers has a notion, that when the Messiah comes, there will be the same disposition of the constellations, as when Moses brought the people out of Egypt, and gave them the law; and that the conjunction will be of Jupiter and Saturn, in the constellation Pisces: there was likewise between Moses and Christ, an agreement in the miracles they wrought, and in other things: <p>him shall ye hear in all things, whatsoever he shall say unto you: all his doctrines are to be believed, embraced, and professed; and all his commands are to be obeyed, and all his ordinances submitted to; and this is hearing, or hearkening, to him in all things, delivered or enjoined by him. <p>(c) Jarchi in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18.htm">Deuteronomy 18</a>.15.

But the N.T. gives us ample reason for referring the verse, if not to the Messiah, yet at least to the Messianic conceptions of the age. To say nothing of St. Stephen’s significant reference to the same prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-37.htm" title="This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.">Acts 7:37</a>, it would certainly seem that in the conversation of our Lord with the Samaritan woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-19.htm" title="The woman said to him, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.">John 4:19</a> ff., the conception of the Messianic prophet is in her mind, and it was upon this prediction of a prophet greater than Moses that the Samaritans built their Messianic hopes (Briggs, <span class="ital">Messiah of the Gospels</span>, p. 272, and see also for <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deuteronomy 18:15</a>, and its Messianic fulfilment, <span class="ital">Messianic Prophecy</span>, p. 110 ff.).

This was a comparison which the Jews themselves were fond of making, and they often identified the prophet of whom Moses spake with the Messiah. Thus the <span class="ital">Midrash Rabbah</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/1-9.htm" title="The thing that has been, it is that which shall be; and that which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new thing under the sun.">Ecclesiastes 1:9</a> says, “Rabbi Berakhiah in the name of Rabbi Yizkhak [Isaac] says: ‘As was the former redeemer so shall the latter redeemer be.’ While of the former redeemer it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-20.htm" title="And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them on an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt: and Moses took the rod of God in his hand.">Exodus 4:20</a>), ‘And Moses took his wife and his sons and set them upon an ass,’ so of the latter: for it says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a>), ‘He is lowly and riding upon an ass.’ And while the former redeemer brought down manna, as it says (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-4.htm" title="Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or no.">Exodus 16:4</a>), ‘Behold I will rain bread from heaven for you,’ so the latter redeemer will bring down manna.

With the prophecy of Moses presently after was conjoined its effect, viz. the leading forth of the people from Egypt: with the prophecy of Christ was conjoined presently after its effect, viz. redemption. The people could not endure the voice of the Lord: they desired to hear Moses: to hear Christ is much more desirable. Moses spake to the people all things, and those alone which the Lord commanded, and that most fully: Christ did so in a much greater degree. And so Christ answers to Moses, so as to be even greater, in respect to His Divine Person and Gospel office: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-2.htm" title="Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was faithful in all his house....">Hebrews 3:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/3-5.htm" title="And Moses truly was faithful in all his house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;...">Hebrews 3:5-6</a>, “This man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as He who hath builded the house hath more honour than the house—Moses as a servant—but Christ as a Son;” with which comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-7.htm" title="My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house.">Numbers 12:7</a>.

That this was understood by the Jews to relate to some one great prophet who had not yet come, appears from the question "Art thou that prophet?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>), and from the saying of the Jews after the miracle of the loaves and fishes, "This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-40.htm">John 7:40</a>). St. Peter here teaches that that prophet was none other than Christ himself, who was like unto Moses in the fullness of the revelation given unto him, in his being a Mediator between God and the people, in being the Author of a new law - the law of faith and love, in building a new tabernacle for God to inhabit, even the Church in which he will dwell for ever and ever (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-1.htm">Hebrews 1:1, 2</a>). </body></html>
