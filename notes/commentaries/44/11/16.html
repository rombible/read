Then it had seemed to refer only to the disciples, and the Day of Pentecost had appeared to bring a complete fulfilment of it. Now Peter had learnt to see that it had a wider range, that the gift might be bestowed on those who were not of Israel, and who were not called to come outwardly within the covenant of Israel. If the baptism of the Holy Ghost had been thus given to them it implied, as the greater includes the less, that they were admissible to the baptism of water.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-16.htm" title="Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost....">Acts 11:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then remembered I the word of the Lord </span>— This descent of the Holy Ghost on them, as on us at the beginning of our public ministry, was such an extraordinary occurrence, that I immediately called to mind, and could not but reflect on, the word of the Lord, as then remarkably verified; <span class="ital">how he said </span>— Just before his ascension, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm" title="For John truly baptized with water; but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence.">Acts 1:5</a>,) <span class="ital">Ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost </span>— For this pouring forth of the Spirit upon them appeared to be a wonderful accomplishment of that prediction. <span class="ital">Forasmuch then as God </span>— The sovereign dispenser of his own favours; <span class="ital">gave them the like gift as he did unto us who believed </span>— That is, because we believed, not because we were circumcised, was the Holy Ghost given to us. <span class="ital">What was I that I should withstand </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">δυνατος κωλυσαι</span>, <span class="ital">that I should be able to prohibit, God </span>— From conferring such a gift upon them; or should presume to oppose myself against his wise and gracious pleasure? They had inquired only concerning his eating with the Gentiles, but he satisfies them likewise concerning his baptizing them; and shows that he had done right in going to Cornelius, not only by the command of God, but also by the event, the descent of the Holy Ghost. And who are we, <span class="ital">that </span>we <span class="ital">should withstand God? </span>— Particularly by laying down rules of Christian communion, which exclude any whom he has admitted into the church of the firstborn, from worshipping God together. O that all church governors would consider how bold a usurpation this is on the authority of the supreme Lord of the church! O that the sin of thus <span class="ital">withstanding </span>God may not be laid to the charge of those who, perhaps with a good intention, but in an over-fondness for their own forms, have done it, and are continually doing it! <span class="ital">When they heard these things, they held their peace</span> — Being thoroughly satisfied for the present, till the controversy was renewed by some fierce zealots, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved....">Acts 15:1-5</a>; <span class="ital">and glorified God </span>— For so wonderful a manifestation of his grace; <span class="ital">saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles </span>— The poor, ignorant, uncircumcised, despised, idolatrous Gentiles; <span class="ital">granted repentance unto life </span>— Has not only made them overtures of it, but has graciously wrought it in some of their hearts. Here, it is plain, they speak of those to whom this repentance was granted, as persons who before, according to their apprehension, were in a state of spiritual death; in which condition, it is probable, they had thought all uncircumcised persons to be: and, without doubt, they must mean to include the idolatrous Gentiles among the rest, as those who were most evidently and certainly so. Observe, reader, true repentance is a change from spiritual death to spiritual life, and leads to life everlasting.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:1-18 The imperfect state of human nature strongly appears, when godly persons are displeased even to hear that the word of God has been received, because their own system has not been attended to. And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The word of the Lord - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16, 17.
