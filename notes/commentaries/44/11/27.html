The proper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes one who, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believes his promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ's precepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the name of Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name without the reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession will bestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give both the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions, and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. True Christians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus will fruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankind were true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another! The whole earth would be like one large family, every member of which would strive to be dutiful and kind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in these days - While Barnabas and Saul were at Antioch.<p>Came prophets - The word "prophet" denotes properly "one who foretells future events." See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm">Matthew 7:15</a>. It is sometimes used in the New Testament to denote simply "religious teachers, instructors sent from God, without particular reference to future events." To teach the people in the doctrines of religion was a part of the prophetic office, and this idea was only sometimes denoted by the use of the word. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm">1 Corinthians 14:5</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-24.htm">1 Corinthians 14:24</a>. These prophets seem to have been endowed in a remarkable manner with the knowledge of future events; with the power of explaining mysteries; and in some cases with the power of speaking foreign languages. In this case, it seems that one of them at least had the power of foretelling future events. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ac 11:27-30.

Their working was entirely analogous to that of the O. T. prophets. Revelation, incitement, and inspiration on the part of God gave them their qualification; the unveiling of what was hidden in respect of the divine counsel for the exercise of a psychological and moral influence on given circumstances, but always in reference to Christ and His work, was the tenor of what these interpreters of God spoke. The prediction of what was future was, as with the old, so also with the new prophets, no permanent characteristic feature; but naturally and necessarily the divinely-illuminated glance ranged very often into the future development of the divine counsel and kingdom, and saw what was to come. In respect to the degree of the inspired seizure, the <span class="greekheb">προφῆται</span> are related to the <span class="greekheb">γλώσσις λαλοῦντες</span> (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>) in such a way that the intellectual consciousness was not thrown into the background with the former as with the latter, and so the mental excitement was not raised to the extent of its becoming ecstatic, nor did their speaking stand in need of interpretation.

The same prophet as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-10.htm" title="And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.">Acts 21:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦ πνεύματος</span>] This characterizes the announcement (<span class="greekheb">ἐσήμανε</span>) of the famine as something imparted to the prophet by the Holy Spirit; hence Eichhorn’s opinion (comp. Heinrichs), that the famine was already present in its beginnings, does great violence to the representation of the text, which, moreover, by <span class="greekheb">ὅστις</span> … <span class="greekheb">Κλαυδίου</span> states the fulfillment as having occurred afterwards, and consequently makes the event to appear at that time still as future, which also <span class="greekheb">μέλλειν ἔσεσθαι</span> definitely affirms.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λιμὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">οἰκουμένην</span>] that a great famine was appointed (by God) to set in over the whole inhabited earth. Thus generally is <span class="greekheb">τὴν οἰκουμ</span>. to be understood in the original sense of the prophet, who sees no local limits drawn for the famine beheld in prophetic vision, and therefore represents it not as a partial, but as an unrestricted one. Just because the utterance is a prediction, according to its genuine prophetic character, there is no ground for giving to the general and usual meaning of <span class="greekheb">τὴν οἰκουμ</span>.—which is, moreover, designedly brought into relief by <span class="greekheb">ὅλην</span>—any geographical limitation at all (to the land of Judaea or the Roman empire; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed.">Luke 2:1</a>). This very unlimited character of the vision, on the one hand, warranted the hyperbolical form of the expression, as given by Agabus, while yet, on the other hand, the famine extending itself far and wide, but yet limited, which afterwards historically occurred, might be regarded as the event corresponding to the entirely general prophetic vision, and be described by Luke as its fulfilment. History pointed out the limits, within which what was seen and predicted without limitation found its fulfilment, inasmuch, namely, as this famine, which set in in the fourth year of the reign of Claudius (A.D. 44), extended only to Judaea and the neighbouring countries, and particularly fell on Jerusalem itself, which was supported by the Syrian queen Helena of Adiabene with corn and figs. See Joseph. Antt. xx. 2. 6, xx. 5. 2; Eus. H. E. ii. 11. The view which includes as part of the fulfilment a yet later famine (Baumgarten), which occurred in the eleventh year of Claudius, especially at Rome (Suet. Claud. 18; Tacit. Ann. xii. 43), offends against the words (<span class="greekheb">λιμὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἣτις</span>) as well as against the connection of the history (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:...">Acts 11:29-30</a>). It is altogether inadmissible to bring in here the different famines, which successively occurred under Claudius in different parts of the empire (Ewald), since, by the famine here meant, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:...">Acts 11:29-30</a>, Judaea was affected, and the others were not synchronous with this. Lastly, very arbitrary is the assertion of Baumgarten, that the famine was predicted as a sign and herald of the Parousia, and that the fulfilment under Claudius was therefore merely a preliminary one, which pointed to a future and final fulfilment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On <span class="greekheb">λιμός</span> as feminine (Doric), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-14.htm" title="And when he had spent all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he began to be in want.">Luke 15:14</a>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-26.htm" title="But to none of them was Elias sent, save to Sarepta, a city of Sidon, to a woman that was a widow.">Luke 4:26</a>, and Bornemann on our passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm" title="And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch.">Acts 11:27</a>.

We cannot gather from the N.
