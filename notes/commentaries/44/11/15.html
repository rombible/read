And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as I began to speak - Or, while I was speaking.<p>The Holy Ghost ... - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm">Acts 10:44</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Who shall tell thee words whereby thou and all thy house shall be saved&#8212;The historian makes the angel express this much more generally (Ac 10:6). So also the subsequent report of it by the deputies and by Cornelius himself to Peter (Ac 10:22, 32). But as Peter tarried with Cornelius certain days, and they doubtless talked over the wonderful scene together, perhaps this fuller and richer form of what the angel said was given to Peter; or the apostle himself may have expressed what the angel certainly designed by directing them to send for him. Observe, "salvation" is here made to hang upon "words," that is, the Gospel message concerning Christ. But on the "salvation" of Cornelius, see on [1990]Ac 10:34, 35. On that of his "house," see on [1991]Lu 19:10.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As I began to speak; </span> whilst Peter was speaketh, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-1.htm" title="The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,">Acts 1:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Holy Ghost fell on them, </span> as in the day of Pentecost, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-4.htm" title="And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.">Acts 2:4</a></span>, he had fallen on the apostles; either visibly, by fiery cloven tongues; or rather by extraordinarily enduing them with the gift of tongues; enabling the most illiterate amongst them to speak in any language needful for any to understand towards their salvation. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And as I began to speak,...., That is, whilst he was speaking; the word "begin" with Luke, both, in his Gospel and in this history, is used not to denote the time or order of any action, but the thing itself; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm">Luke 4:21</a> for otherwise it was towards the close, and not at the beginning of his discourse, that what follows happened: <p>the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning; of our ministry, since the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ; meaning on the day of Pentecost, and that the Holy Ghost fell on Cornelius and those that were with him, in a like visible form, and in the same kind of gifts, as speaking with tongues, as on them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἄρξασθαι</span>: somewhat more precisely stated than in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>.
