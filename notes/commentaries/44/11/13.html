And we are too apt to despair of doing good to those who yet, when tried, prove very teachable. It is the bane and damage of the church, to shut out those from it, and from the benefit of the means of grace, who are not in every thing as we are. Peter stated the whole affair. We should at all times bear with the infirmities of our brethren; and instead of taking offence, or answering with warmth, we should explain our motives, and show the nature of our proceedings. That preaching is certainly right, with which the Holy Ghost is given. While men are very zealous for their own regulations, they should take care that they do not withstand God; and those who love the Lord will glorify him, when made sure that he has given repentance to life to any fellow-sinners. Repentance is God's gift; not only his free grace accepts it, but his mighty grace works it in us, grace takes away the heart of stone, and gives us a heart of flesh. The sacrifice of God is a broken spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-9.htm">Acts 10:9-33</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. seen an angel&#8212;literally, "the angel," for the rumor took that definite shape.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">An angel, </span> who, by reason of his appearing a man, is, in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-30.htm" title="And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,">Acts 10:30</a></span>, called <span class="bld">a man.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house,.... The clause, "in his house", is very appropriately put; for since an angel had entered into his house, it could not be criminal in Peter, and the six brethren, to follow him. In one place he is called a man, and in another place an angel; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-3.htm">Acts 10:3</a>, because, though he was an angel, yet he appeared in the form of a man, as it was usual for angels to do; but whether Cornelius knew that he was an angel, is not certain, since he calls him a man; and not he, but Luke the historian, and Peter, who repeats the account of the vision, call him an angel; however, he looked upon him as an extraordinary person, as sent to him from God, and therefore obeyed the heavenly vision. The Ethiopic version reads, "an angel of God; which stood and said unto him, send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter"; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-5.htm">Acts 10:5</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he shewed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said unto him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm" title="And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;">Acts 11:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">σταθέντα</span>—<span class="greekheb">σταθείς</span>: used only by St. Luke, in Gospel and Acts: <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-11.htm" title="The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, God, I thank you, that I am not as other men are, extortionists, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.">Luke 18:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-40.htm" title="And Jesus stood, and commanded him to be brought to him: and when he was come near, he asked him,">Luke 18:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-8.htm" title="And Zacchaeus stood, and said to the Lord: Behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold.">Luke 19:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-14.htm" title="But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said to them, You men of Judaea, and all you that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my words:">Acts 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-20.htm" title="Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this life.">Acts 5:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm" title="And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;">Acts 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-22.htm" title="Then Paul stood in the middle of Mars' hill, and said, You men of Athens, I perceive that in all things you are too superstitious.">Acts 17:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-18.htm" title="Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought none accusation of such things as I supposed:">Acts 25:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm" title="But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the middle of them, and said, Sirs, you should have listened to me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.">Acts 27:21</a>, found therefore in <span class="ital">all</span> parts of Acts (Friedrich, Vogel).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">and he shewed us how he had seen an angel</span>] The Greek has “and he related to us how he had seen <span class="ital">the</span> angel.” Before St Peter made this defence, and long before St Luke put it down in the Acts, the story of Cornelius and his vision would be well known, and so the definite article would be used in speaking of it, i.e. “<span class="ital">the</span> angel” of whom all men had heard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">said unto him</span>] The oldest MSS. omit the last two words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Send men to Joppa</span>] “Men” is omitted in the best MSS. This is one of the numerous insertions by which a repetition of a narrative in this book has been brought into exact verbal accord with the previous form. There have been times when devout men thought much of this verbal accord. It is therefore worth notice that the writers of the N. T. disregarded it utterly. The words in such a solemn inscription as that above the Cross differ in all the four Gospels, and St Peter, when in the Second Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-17.htm" title="For he was numbered with us, and had obtained part of this ministry.">Acts 1:17</a>) he speaks of the heavenly voice heard at the Transfiguration, varies verbally from each of the accounts of the Evangelists.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-13.htm" title="And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, which stood and said to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;">Acts 11:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸν ἄγγελον</span>, <span class="ital">the angel</span>) He speaks, adding the article, as of an occurrence now very well known to him.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> <span class="accented">- Told</span> for showed, A.V.; <span class="accented">the angel</span> for <span class="accented">an angel</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">standing in his house and saying</span> for <span class="accented">in his house which stood and said unto him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">send</span> for <span class="accented">send men</span>, A.V. and T.R. <span class="accented">fetch</span> for <span class="accented">call for</span>, A.V. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>An angel<p>It has the definite article: "the angel," mentioned in ch. 10. </body></html>
