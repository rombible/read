It indicates the assurance that Saul would approve of the work which had been going on at Antioch, and the confident belief that he was the right person to direct and organise it. It probably implies also some intercourse with the Apostle, by letter or message, since his departure from Jerusalem. In the absence of any direct record, we can only infer that Saul had remained at Tarsus, carrying on his occupation as a tent-maker (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>), and preaching the gospel there and in the neighbouring cities of Cilicia (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-41.htm" title="And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.">Acts 15:41</a>) “to the Jew first and also to the Gentile.” It is clear that he must have heard of the grace of God that had been manifested at Antioch with great joy, and accepted the invitation to join in the work there with a ready gladness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:...">Acts 11:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then departed Barnabas </span>— Namely, after some abode at Antioch, perceiving, probably, that he wanted an assistant in his labours; <span class="ital">to Tarsus, to seek Saul </span>— Whose departure thither was mentioned, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm" title="Which when the brothers knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.">Acts 9:30</a>. <span class="ital">And finding him there </span>— According to his expectation, he gave him, it seems, such an account of the state of things at Antioch, and such a view of the extensive usefulness which appeared to present itself there, that he prevailed with him to accompany him at his return to that populous and celebrated city.

The proper meaning of this name is, a follower of Christ; it denotes one who, from serious thought, embraces the religion of Christ, believes his promises, and makes it his chief care to shape his life by Christ's precepts and example. Hence it is plain that multitudes take the name of Christian to whom it does not rightly belong. But the name without the reality will only add to our guilt. While the bare profession will bestow neither profit nor delight, the possession of it will give both the promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. Grant, Lord, that Christians may forget other names and distinctions, and love one another as the followers of Christ ought to do. True Christians will feel for their brethren under afflictions. Thus will fruit be brought forth to the praise and glory of God. If all mankind were true Christians, how cheerfully would they help one another! The whole earth would be like one large family, every member of which would strive to be dutiful and kind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then departed ... - Why Barnabas sought Saul is not known. It is probable, however, that it was owing to the remarkable success which he had in Antioch. There was a great revival of religion, and there was need of additional labor. In such times the ministers of the gospel need additional help, as men in harvest-time need the aid of others. Saul was in this vicinity <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-30.htm">Acts 9:30</a>, and he was eminently suited to assist in this work. With him Barnabas was well acquainted <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm">Acts 9:27</a>, and probably there was no other one in that vicinity whose help he could obtain.<p>To Tarsus - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-11.htm">Acts 9:11</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Ac 11:25, 26. Barnabas, Finding the Work in Antioch Too Much for Him, Goes to Tarsus for Saul&#8212;They Labor There Together for a Whole Year with Much Success, and Antioch Becomes the Honored Birthplace of the Term Christian.<p>25. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus for to seek Saul&#8212;Of course, this was after the hasty despatch of Saul to Tarsus, no doubt by Barnabas himself among others, to escape the fury of the Jews at Jerusalem. And as Barnabas was the first to take the converted persecutor by the hand and procure his recognition as a disciple by the brethren at Jerusalem (Ac 9:27), so he alone seems at that early period to have discerned in him those peculiar endowments by virtue of which he was afterwards to eclipse all others. Accordingly, instead of returning to Jerusalem, to which, no doubt, he sent accounts of his proceedings from time to time, finding that the mine in Antioch was rich in promise and required an additional and powerful hand to work, he leaves it for a time, takes a journey to Tarsus, "finds Saul" (seemingly implying&#8212;not that he lay hid [Bengel], but that he was engaged at the time in some preaching circuit&#8212;see on [1996]Ac 15:23), and returns with him to Antioch. Nor were his hopes disappointed. As co-pastors, for the time being, of the Church there, they so labored that the Gospel, even in that great and many-sided community, achieved for itself a name which will live and be gloried in as long as this world lasts, as the symbol of all that is most precious to the fallen family of man:&#8212;"The disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." This name originated not within, but without, the Church; not with their Jewish enemies, by whom they were styled "Nazarenes" (Ac 24:5), but with the heathen in Antioch, and (as the form of the word shows) with the Romans, not the Greeks there [Olshausen]. It was not at first used in a good sense (as Ac 26:28; 1Pe 4:16 show), though hardly framed out of contempt (as De Wette, Baumgarten, &c.); but as it was a noble testimony to the light in which the Church regarded Christ&#8212;honoring Him as their only Lord and Saviour, dwelling continually on His name, and glorying in it&#8212;so it was felt to be too apposite and beautiful to be allowed to die.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Saul, </span> or Paul, being Barnabas’s friend and acquaintance, whom Barnabas had brought to the knowledge of the apostles, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm" title="But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.">Acts 9:27</a></span>; he goes now to seek him, that they might advise and strengthen one another in the work of the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus,....
