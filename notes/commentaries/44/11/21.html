The wrath of man is made to praise God. What should the ministers of Christ preach, but Christ? Christ, and him crucified? Christ, and him glorified? And their preaching was accompanied with the Divine power. The hand of the Lord was with them, to bring that home to the hearts and consciences of men, which they could but speak to the outward ear. They believed; they were convinced of the truth of the gospel. They turned from a careless, carnal way of living, to live a holy, heavenly, spiritual life. They turned from worshipping God in show and ceremony, to worship him in the Spirit and in truth. They turned to the Lord Jesus, and he became all in all with them. This was the work of conversion wrought upon them, and it must be wrought upon every one of us. It was the fruit of their faith; all who sincerely believe, will turn to the Lord, When the Lord Jesus is preached in simplicity, and according to the Scriptures, he will give success; and when sinners are thus brought to the Lord, really good men, who are full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, will admire and rejoice in the grace of God bestowed on them. Barnabas was full of faith; full of the grace of faith, and full of the fruits of the faith that works by love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the hand of the Lord - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-66.htm">Luke 1:66</a>.

(See on [1994]Ac 10:1.) Nay, we read of no influence which the accession of Cornelius and his house had on the further progress of the Gospel among the Gentiles; whereas there here open upon us operations upon the Gentiles from quite a different quarter, and attended with ever growing success. The only great object served by the case of Cornelius was the formal recognition of the principles which that case afterwards secured.

Not only his hand of providence, which brought them thither, and protected them; and his hand of love, grace and mercy, which was upon them, and supplied them with gifts and grace, and everything necessary for them; and his hand of wisdom, which guided and directed them; but his hand of power, the same with the arm of the Lord, which when revealed, and made bare, the report of the Gospel is believed: but if that is not put forth, or efficacious grace is not exerted, no work is done, none are brought to believe, or are converted; ministers labour in vain, and spend their strength for nought: but this was not the case here, it was otherwise with these preachers; though they had travelled many miles, and were come into strange places, they were not left of God, nor without success, the power of God attended their ministry; so that the Gospel preached by them came not in word only, but in power, and it was the power of God unto salvation: hence it follows, <p>and a great number believed; not the Gospel only, but in Christ preached in it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm">Acts 11:20</a> which was not owing to the force of moral persuasion in the ministers, nor to the power of free will in the people, but to the hand or power of the Lord; for the work of faith is not a work of man's will, but of God's almighty power and grace; and when that is displayed, multitudes believe in Christ for righteousness and life: and turned to the Lord; and obeyed his commands; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-59.htm">Psalm 119:59</a> as a fruit, effect, and consequence of believing in Christ; for not first conversion is here intended, which is not man's work, but God's, and in which God is the agent, and man is passive; but obedience to the ordinances of Christ, as the fruit of faith, is meant. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/11.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-21.htm" title="And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord....">Acts 11:21-26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χεὶρ κυρίου</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-66.htm" title="And all they that heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be!

But it certainly did <span class="ital">not</span> proceed <span class="ital">from the Jews</span>, because <span class="greekheb">Χριστός</span> was known to them as the interpretation of <span class="greekheb">מָשִׁיחַ</span>, and they would not therefore have transferred so sacred a name to the hated apostates. Hence the origin of the name must be derived from the Gentiles in Antioch.[267] By these the name of the Head of the new religious society, “Christ,” was not regarded as an official name, which it already was among the Christians themselves ever more and more becoming; and hence they formed according to the wonted mode the <span class="ital">party-name: Christiani</span> (Tac. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44: “auctor nominis ejus Christus Tiberio imperitante per procuratorem Pontium Pilatum supplicio affectus erat”). At <span class="ital">Antioch</span>, the seat of the mother-church of Gentile Christianity, this took place <span class="ital">at that time</span> (for this follows from the reading <span class="greekheb">ἐγέν</span>. <span class="greekheb">δὲ αὐτοῖς</span>), because in that year the joint labours of Paul and Barnabas occasioned so considerable an enlargement of the church, and therewith naturally its increase in social and public consideration. And it was at Antioch that this name was borne <span class="ital">first</span>, earlier than anywhere else (<span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>, or, according to B <span class="greekheb">א</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρώτως</span>, Lobeck, <span class="ital">ad Phryn.</span> p. 311 f.), because here the Christians, in consequence of the predominant Gentile-Christian element, asserted themselves for the first time not as a sect of Judaism, but as an independent community. There is nothing to support the view that the name was at first a <span class="ital">title of ridicule</span> (de Wette, Baumgarten, after Wetstein and older interpreters). The conjecture of Baur, that the origin of the name was referred to Antioch, because that was the first Gentile city in which there were Christians (Zeller also mistrusts the account before us), cannot be justified by the Latin form of the word (see “Wetstein, <span class="ital">ad</span> <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-17.htm" title="Tell us therefore, What think you?
