The Greek words for “possessions” and “goods” both mean “property,” the former as a thing acquired, the latter as that which belongs to a man for the time being. Custom, however, had introduced a technical distinction, and “possessions” stands for real property, “goods” for personal. So in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-1.htm" title="But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,">Acts 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-3.htm" title="But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?">Acts 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-8.htm" title="And Peter answered to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much? And she said, Yes, for so much.">Acts 5:8</a>, the former word is used interchangeably with that which is translated “field,” and in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm" title="Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:">Proverbs 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-16.htm" title="She considers a field, and buys it: with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard.">Proverbs 31:16</a>, is used both for “field” and “vineyard.”<p><span class= "bld">As every man had need.</span>—The words imply at least the endeavour to discriminate. The money was not given literally to every one who applied for it, and so the way was prepared for more fixed and definite rules.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:42-47 In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, of the first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And sold - That is, they sold as much as was necessary in order to procure the means of providing for the needs of each other.<p>Possessions - Property, particularly real estate. This word, &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  kte&#772;mata, refers properly to their fixed property, as lands, houses, vineyards, etc. The word rendered "goods," &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  huparxeis, refers to their personal or movable "property."<p>And parted them to all - They distributed them to supply the needs of their poorer brethren, according to their necessities.<p>As every man had need - This expression limits and fixes the meaning of what is said before. The passage does not mean that they sold all their possessions, or that they relinquished their title to all their property, but that they so far regarded all as common as to be willing to part with it if it was needful to supply the needs of the others. Hence, the property was laid at the disposal of the apostles, and they were desired to distribute it freely to meet the needs of the poor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-34.htm">Acts 4:34-35</a>.<p>This was an important incident in the early propagation of religion, and it may suggest many useful reflections:<p>1. We see the effect of religion. The love of property is one of the strongest affections which people have. There is nothing that will overcome it but religion. That will; and one of the first effects of the gospel was to loosen the hold of Christians on property.<p>2. It is the duty of the church to provide for the needs of its poor and needy members. There can be no doubt that property should now be regarded as so far common as that the needs of the poor should be supplied by those who are rich. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm">Matthew 26:11</a>.<p>3. If it be asked why the early disciples evinced this readiness to part with their property in this manner, it may be replied:<p>(1) That the apostles had done it before them. The family of the Saviour had all things common.<p>(2) it was the nature of religion to do it.<p>(3) the circumstances of the persons assembled on this occasion were such as to require it. They were many of them from distant regions, and probably many of them of the poorer class of the people in Jerusalem. In this they evinced what should be done in behalf of the poor in the church at all times.<p>4. If it be asked whether this was done commonly among the early Christians, it may be replied that there is no evidence that it was. It is mentioned here, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm">Acts 4:32-37</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/5-1.htm">Acts 5:1-7</a>. It does not appear that it was done even by all who were afterward converted in Judea; and there is no evidence that it was done in Antioch, Ephesus, Corinth, Philippi, Rome, etc. That the effect of religion was to make people liberal and willing to provide for the poor there can be no doubt. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-19.htm">2 Corinthians 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>. But there is no proof that it was common to part with their possessions and to lay them at the feet of the apostles. Religion does not contemplate, evidently, that people should break up all the arrangements in society, but it contemplates that those who have property should be ready and willing to part with it for the help of the poor and needy.<p>5. If it be asked, then, whether all the arrangements of property should be broken up now, and believers have all things in common, we are prepared to answer "No." Because:<p>(1) This was an extraordinary case.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>44. all that believed were together, and had all things common&#8212;(See on [1940]Ac 4:34-37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Those proportions of their estate they set apart to this charitable work; whether they did arise out of the sale of house or land, called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">possessions, </span> or of any chattels or movable estate, called here <span class="bld">goods:</span> but that they did not divest themselves of all property, appears in that we find soon after this, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a></span>, Mary the mother of St. Mark to have a house; and Lydia, after she was baptized, did not renounce any propriety in her house, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-15.htm" title="And when she was baptized, and her household, she sought us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there.

This was done by Jews, and by Jews only; who, when they embraced the Gospel of Christ, were informed that the destruction of their city, and nation, was at hand; and therefore they sold their estates before hand, and put them to this use; which was necessary to be done, both for the support of the Gospel in Judea, and for the carrying and spreading of it among the Gentiles: but is not to be drawn into a precedent, or an example in after times; nor is ever any such thing proposed to the Christian churches, or exhorted to by any of the apostles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-45.htm" title="And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.">Acts 2:45</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὰ κτήματα</span> … <span class="greekheb">τὰς ὑπάρξεις</span>: according to their derivation, the former word would mean that which is acquired, and the latter that which belongs to a man for the time being.
