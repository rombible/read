Not on priests only, or those who had been trained in the schools of the prophets, but on slaves, male and female, should that gift be poured by Him who was no respecter of persons. The life of Amos, the herdsman of Tekoa, the “gatherer of sycomore fruit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm" title="Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdsman, and a gatherer of sycomore fruit:">Amos 7:14</a>), was, perhaps, the earliest example of the gift so bestowed. The apostolic age must have witnessed many. The fisherman of Galilee, who was now speaking, was the forerunner of thousands in whom the teaching of the Spirit has superseded the training of the schools.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had denied Christ, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them. Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, except those who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And on my servants - The Hebrew text in Joel is "upon the servants." The Septuagint and the Latin Vulgate, however, render it "on my servants." In Joel, the prophet would seem to be enumerating the different conditions and ranks of society. The influences of the Spirit would be confined to no class; they would descend on old and young, and even on servants and handmaids. So the Chaldee Paraphrase understood it. But the Septuagint and Peter evidently understood it in the sense of servants of God, as the worshippers of God are often called servants in the Scriptures. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>. It is possible, however, that Joel intended to refer to the servants of God. It is not "upon your servants," etc., as in the former expression, "your sons," etc.; but the form is changed, "upon servants and handmaids." The language, therefore, will admit the construction of the Septuagint and of Peter; and it was this variation in the original Hebrew which suggested, doubtless, the mention of "my servants," etc., instead of your servants.<p>And on my handmaids - Female servants. The name is several times given to pious women, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-16.htm">Psalm 86:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/116-16.htm">Psalm 116:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-38.htm">Luke 1:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm">Luke 1:48</a>. The meaning of this verse does not materially differ from the former. In the times of the gospel, those who were brought under its influence would be remarkably endowed with ability to declare the will of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. in the last days&#8212;meaning, the days of the Messiah (Isa 2:2); as closing all preparatory arrangements, and constituting the final dispensation of God's kingdom on earth.<p>pour out of my Spirit&#8212;in contrast with the mere drops of all preceding time.<p>upon all flesh&#8212;hitherto confined to the seed of Abraham.<p>sons &#8230; daughters &#8230; young men &#8230; old men &#8230; servants &#8230; handmaidens&#8212;without distinction of sex, age, or rank.<p>see visions &#8230; dream dreams&#8212;This is a mere accommodation to the ways in which the Spirit operated under the ancient economy, when the prediction was delivered; for in the New Testament, visions and dreams are rather the exception than the rule.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">On my servants and on my handmaidens; </span> to show what all ought to be, that hope to receive any benefit or comfort from the promises of God, either in the law or gospel, the Old or New Testament; viz. such as seek and serve God; but to the disobedient and unbelieving there is not a comfortable word in all the book of God. Some read without the pronoun, on servants and handmaids; to show that God doth not despise men of the lowest rank and condition in the world, but that the promise of the Spirit is made unto them also. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And on my servants, and on my handmaidens,.... In Joel it is only the servants and the handmaids; and which Kimchi interprets of strangers that should stand in the land of Israel, and serve the Israelites. But these phrases do not seem so much to describe the civil state and condition of those persons, as their religious character, being such as were brought, by the power of divine grace, to yield a cheerful obedience to the will of God; though it may also regard the former, and show, that with God there is no distinction and difference of bond or free, of rich or poor; contrary to a maxim of the Jews (s), that the Shekinah does not dwell but upon a wise man, a mighty man, and a rich man, <p>I will pour out, in those days, of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy; see the note on the preceding verse, from whence this clause, "and they shall prophesy", is repeated; for it is not in the text in Joel; which is done to point at the end and effect of the Spirit being poured down upon them, <p>(s) T.

As there was to be no limit of sex or age, so too there was no limit of condition.

But in retaining the word <span class="greekheb">μου</span> we are not obliged to reject the literal meaning “bond-servants,” just as St. Peter himself, in addressing household servants and slaves, commands them to act <span class="greekheb">ὡς δοῦλοι θεοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-16.htm" title="As free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.">1 Peter 2:16</a>): “Intelliguntur servi secundum carnem, diversi a liberis. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a>, sed iidem servi Dei,” Bengel.
