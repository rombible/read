The imagery is drawn as from one of the great thunder-storms of Palestine. There is the lurid blood-red hue of clouds and sky; there are the fiery flashes, the columns or pillars of smoke-like clouds boiling from the abyss. These, in their turn, were probably thought of as symbols of bloodshed, and fire and smoke, such as are involved in the capture and destruction of a city like Jerusalem.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had denied Christ, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them. Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, except those who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I will show wonders - Literally, "I will give signs" -  &#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c9; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  do&#772;so&#772; terata. The word in the Hebrew, &#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;  mowpatiym, means properly "prodigies; wonderful occurrences; miracles performed by God or his messengers," <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-3.htm">Exodus 7:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm">Exodus 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-9.htm">Exodus 11:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>, etc. It is the common word to denote a miracle in the Old Testament. Here it means, however, a portentous appearance, a prodigy, a remarkable occurrence. It is commonly joined in the New Testament with the word "signs" - "signs and wonders," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-24.htm">Matthew 24:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-22.htm">Mark 13:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-48.htm">John 4:48</a>. In these places it does not of necessity mean miracles, but unusual and remarkable appearances. Here it is used to mean great and striking changes in the sky, the sun, moon, etc. The Hebrew is, "I will give signs in the heaven and upon the earth." Peter has quoted it according to the sense, and not according to the letter. The Septuagint is here a literal translation of the Hebrew; and this is one of the instances where the New Testament writers did not quote from either.<p>Much of the difficulty of interpreting these verses consists in affixing the proper meaning to the expression "that great and notable day of the Lord." If it be limited to the day of Pentecost, it is certain that no such events occurred at that time. But there is, it is believed, no propriety in confining it to that time. The description here pertains to "the last days" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>; that is, to the whole of that period of duration, however long, which was known by the prophets as "the last times." That period might be extended through many centuries; and during that period all these events would take place. The day of the Lord is the day when God will manifest himself in a special manner; a day when he will so strikingly be seen in his wonders and his judgments that it may be called his day. Thus, it is applied to the day of judgment as the day of the Son of man; the day in which he will be the great attractive object, and will be signally glorified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-24.htm">Luke 17:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-2.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-12.htm">2 Peter 3:12</a>. If, as I suppose, "that notable day of the Lord" here refers to that future time when God will manifest himself in judgment, then we are not to suppose that Peter meant to say that these "wonders" would take place on the day of Pentecost, or had their fulfillment then, "but would occur under that indefinite period called "the last days," the days of the Messiah, and before that period Was closed by the great day of the Lord." The gift of tongues was a partial fulfillment of the general prophecy pertaining to those times. And as the prophecy was thus partially fulfilled, it was a pledge that it would be entirely; and thus there was laid a foundation for the necessity of repentance, and for calling on the Lord in order to be saved.<p>Blood - Blood is commonly used as an emblem of slaughter or of battle.<p>Fire - Fire is also an image of war, or the conflagration of towns and dwellings in time of war.<p>Vapour of smoke - The word "vapor," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;  atmis, means commonly an exhalation from the earth, etc., easily moved from one place to another. Here it means (Hebrew: Joel) rising columbus or pillars of smoke, and is another image of the calamities of war the smoke rising from burning towns. It has always been customary in war to burn the towns of an enemy, and to render him as helpless as possible. Hence, the calamities denoted here are those represented by such scenes. To what particular scenes there is reference here it is impossible now to say. It may be remarked, however, that scenes of this kind occurred before the destruction of Jerusalem, and there is a striking resemblance between the description in Joel and that by which our Saviour foretells the destruction of Jerusalem. See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm">Matthew 24:21-24</a>. Dr. Thomson (Land and the Book, vol. 2, p. 311) supposes that the reference in Joel may have been to the usual appearances of the sirocco, or that they may have suggested the image used here. He says: "We have two kinds of sirocco, one accompanied with vehement wind, which fills the air with dust and fine sand. I have often seen the whole heavens veiled in gloom with this sort of sandcloud, through which the sun, shorn of his beams, looked like a globe of dull smouldering fire. It may have been this phenomenon which suggested that strong prophetic figure of Joel, quoted by Peter on the day of Pentecost. Wonders in the heaven and in the earth; blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke; the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood. The pillars of smoke are probably those columns of sand and dust raised high in the air by local whirlwinds, which often accompany the sirocco. On the great desert of the Hauran I have seen a score of them marching with great rapidity over the plain, and they closely resemble 'pillars of smoke.'" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

This may refer either to the appearance of angels, and of an extraordinary star at the birth of Christ; or rather to comets and blazing stars, and particularly to that comet which, in the form of a flaming sword, hung over Jerusalem, and the forms of armies in the heavens engaged together, which were seen before, and portended the destruction of that city (t): <p>and signs in the earth beneath; meaning either the miracles done by Christ, and his apostles, on earth; or those surprising events in Judea and in Jerusalem, a flame was seen in the temple, the doors of it opened of themselves, and a voice was heard in it, saying, let us go hence; and an idiot went about several years together, saying, woe to the people, woe to the city, &amp;c, <p>blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke: by blood is meant not the blood of Christ, either his bloody sweat in the garden, or what he shed on the cross, but the blood of the Jews, shed in war, and in internal seditions and murders: and by "fire" is designed not the Holy Ghost, who now appeared in cloven tongues, as of fire, but the conflagration of the city and temple of Jerusalem, and of many other towns and villages.

So altogether (evidently) the clause of Malachi (with which comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-13.htm" title="For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John....">Matthew 11:13-14</a>, note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/17-11.htm" title="These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so....">Acts 17:11-12</a>, note) looks directly to the coming of John the Baptist, and the mention of <span class="ital">the terrible day</span> of the Lord, the last day, is incidentally subjoined and connected with that clause.—<span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span>, <span class="ital">blood</span>) slaughter and wars.—<span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span>, <span class="ital">fire</span>) Conflagrations.—<span class="greekheb">ἀτμίδα καπνοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">vapour of smoke</span>) Thick smoke ends in a subtle vapour.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> <span class="accented">- The heaven</span> for <span class="accented">heaven</span>, A.V.; on for <span class="accented">in</span>, A.V.
