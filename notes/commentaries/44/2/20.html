Signs, of which these were but faint images, had been predicted by our Lord, echoing, as it were, the words of Joel, as among the preludes of His Advent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That great and notable day.</span>—St. Luke follows the LXX. version. The Hebrew gives, as in our version, “the great and terrible day.” As seen by the prophet, the day was terrible to the enemies of God; a day of blessing to “the remnant whom the Lord should call” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever shall call on the name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD has said, and in the remnant whom the LORD shall call.">Joel 2:32</a>). The Greek word for “notable” (<span class= "ital">epiphanès</span>) lent itself readily to the thought of the great Epiphany or manifestation of Christ as the Judge of all.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-21 Peter's sermon shows that he was thoroughly recovered from his fall, and thoroughly restored to the Divine favour; for he who had denied Christ, now boldly confessed him. His account of the miraculous pouring forth of the Spirit, was designed to awaken the hearers to embrace the faith of Christ, and to join themselves to his church. It was the fulfilling the Scripture, and the fruit of Christ's resurrection and ascension, and proof of both. Though Peter was filled with the Holy Ghost, and spake with tongues as the Spirit gave him utterance, yet he did not think to set aside the Scriptures. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bible; and the Spirit is given, not to do away the Scriptures, but to enable us to understand, approve, and obey them. Assuredly none will escape the condemnation of the great day, except those who call upon the name of the Lord, in and through his Son Jesus Christ, as the Saviour of sinners, and the Judge of all mankind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sun shall be turned into darkness - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm">Matthew 24:29</a>. The same images used here with reference to the sun and moon are used also there: They occur not infrequently, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-24.htm">Mark 13:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7-10</a>. The shining of the sun is an emblem of prosperity; the withdrawing, the eclipse, or the setting of the sun is an emblem of calamity, and is often thus need in the Scriptures, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-20.htm">Isaiah 60:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-9.htm">Jeremiah 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-7.htm">Ezekiel 32:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-12.htm">Revelation 8:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-2.htm">Revelation 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-8.htm">Revelation 16:8</a>. To say that the sun is darkened, or turned into darkness, is an image of calamity, and especially of the calamities of war, when the smoke of burning cities rises to heaven and obscures his light. This is not, therefore, to be taken literally, nor does it afford any indication of what will be at the end of the world in regard to the sun.<p>The moon into blood - The word "blood" here means that obscure, sanguinary color which the moon has when the atmosphere is filled with smoke and vapor, and especially the lurid and alarming appearance which it assumes when smoke and flames are thrown up by earthquakes and fiery eruptions, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-12.htm">Revelation 6:12</a>, "And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and lo, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood," <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-8.htm">Revelation 8:8</a>. In this place it denotes great calamities. The figures used are indicative of wars, and conflagrations, and earthquakes. As these things are <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a> applied to the destruction of Jerusalem; as they actually occurred previous to that event (see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/24.htm">Matthew 24</a>), it may be supposed that the prophecy in Joel had an immediate reference to that. The meaning of the quotation by Peter in this place therefore is, that what occurred on the day of Pentecost was the beginning of the serges of wonders that was to take place during the times of the Messiah. It is not intimated that those scenes were to close or to be exhausted in that age. They may precede that great day of the Lord which is yet to come in view of the whole earth.<p>That great and notable day of the Lord - This is called the great day of the Lord, because on that day he will be signally manifested, more impressively and strikingly than on other times. The word "notable," &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834;  epiphane&#772;, means "signal, illustrious, distinguished." In Joel the word is "terrible or fearful"; a word applicable to days of calamity, and trial, and judgment. The Greek word here rendered notable is also in the Septuagint frequently used to denote "calamity" or "times of judgment," <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-23.htm">2 Samuel 7:23</a>. This will apply to any day in which God signally manifests himself, but particularly to a day when he shall come forth to punish people, as at the destruction of Jerusalem, or at the day of judgment. The meaning is, that those wonders would take place before that distinguished day should arrive when God would come forth in judgment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.
