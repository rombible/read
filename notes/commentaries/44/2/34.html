(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-44.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?">Matthew 22:44</a>.)

Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For David is not ascended into the heavens - That is, David has not risen from the dead and ascended to heaven. This further shows that <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a> could not refer to David, but must refer to the Messiah. Great as they esteemed David, and much as they were accustomed to apply these expressions of the Scripture to him, yet they could not be applicable to him. They must refer to some other being; and especially that passage which Peter now proceeds to quote. It was of great importance to show that these expressions could not apply to David, and also that David bore testimony to the exalted character and dignity of the Messiah. Hence, Peter here adduces David himself as affirming that the Messiah was to be exalted to a dignity far above his own. This does not affirm that David was not saved, or that his spirit had not ascended to heaven, but that he had not been exalted in the heavens in the sense in which Peter was speaking of the Messiah.<p>But he saith himself - <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm">Psalm 110:1</a>.<p>The Lord - The small capitals used in translating the word "Lord" in the Bible denote that the original word is &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;  Yahweh. The Hebrews regarded this as the unique name of God, a name incommunicable to any other being. It is not applied to any being but God in the Scriptures. The Jews had such a reverence for it that they never pronounced it; but when it occurred in the Scriptures they pronounced another name, &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  &#768;Adonaay. Here it means, "Yahweh said," etc.<p>My Lord - This is a different word in the Hebrew - it is &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1497;  &#768;Adonaay. It properly is applied by a servant to his master, or a subject to his sovereign, or is used as a title of respect by an inferior to a superior. It means here, "Yahweh said to him whom I, David, acknowledge to be my superior and sovereign." Thus, though he regarded him as his descendant according to the flesh, yet he regarded him also as his superior and Lord. By reference to this passage our Saviour confounded the Pharisees, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42-46</a>. That the passage in this Psalm refers to the Messiah is clear. Our Saviour, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>, expressly applied it thus, and in such a manner as to show that this was the well-understood doctrine of the Jews. See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-42.htm">Matthew 22:42</a>, etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-36. David &#8230; is &#8230; dead and buried, &c.&#8212;Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this was palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take David himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the whole argument of the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in Jesus, of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him. A further illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from Ps 110:1, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For David is not ascended into the heavens; </span> hence St. Peter here proves, that these words, spoken by David, were not principally to be understood concerning himself, but concerning Christ the Messiah; for David, as to his body, was in the sepulchre, which on that account was kept amongst them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord said unto my Lord; </span> the eternal Father unto his eternal Son, who was now made flesh—hence our Saviour proves his Divinity, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-45.htm" title="If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?">Matthew 22:45</a></span>.

St. Peter does not demand belief upon his own assertion, but he again appeals to the Scriptures, and to words which could not have received a fulfilment in the case of David. In this appeal he reproduces the very words in which, some seven weeks before, our Lord Himself had convicted the scribes of error in their interpretation of this same Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-44.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you on my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool?">Matthew 22:44</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-35.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?">Mark 12:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-41.htm" title="And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?">Luke 20:41</a>), and, “unlearned” in the eyes of the scribes, had answered the question which they could not answer, how David’s Son was also David’s Lord. No passage of Scripture is so constantly referred to in the N.T. as this 110th Psalm, <span class="ital">cf.</span> references above, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-13.htm" title="But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool?">Hebrews 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-6.htm" title="As he said also in another place, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-17.htm" title="For he testifies, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.">Hebrews 7:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm" title="(For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an oath by him that said to him, The Lord swore and will not repent, You are a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec:)">Hebrews 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-13.htm" title="From now on expecting till his enemies be made his footstool.">Hebrews 10:13</a>. The Psalm was always regarded as Messianic by the Jews (Weber, <span class="ital">Jüdische Theologie</span>, p. 357 (1897); Edersheim, <span class="ital">Jesus the Messiah</span>, ii., 720 (Appendix); Cheyne, <span class="ital">Origin of the Psalter</span>, p. 35; Driver, <span class="ital">Introduction to O. T.</span>, pp. 362, 363; and if it had not been so in the time of our Lord, it is obvious that His argument would have missed its point if those to whom He addressed His question “What think ye of the Christ?” could have answered that David was not speaking of the coming Messiah.
