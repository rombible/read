As interpreted by St. Peter’s words in his Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>), the words conveyed to his mind the thought which has been embodied in the article of the “Descent into Hell,” or <span class= "ital">Hades, </span>in the Apostle’s Creed. The death of Christ was an actual death, and while the body was laid in the grave, the soul passed into the world of the dead, the <span class= "ital">Sheol</span> of the Hebrews, the <span class= "ital">Hades</span> of the Greeks, to carry on there the redemptive work which had been begun on earth. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/13-34.htm" title="And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, now no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.">Acts 13:34-37</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm" title="(Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth?">Ephesians 4:9</a>.) Here again we have an interesting coincidence with St. Peter’s language (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm" title="By which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison;">1Peter 3:19</a>), as to the work of Christ in preaching to the “spirits in prison.”<p><span class= "bld">Neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span>—The word for “holy” is different from that commonly so rendered, and conveys the idea of personal piety and godliness rather than consecration. As the Psalmist used the words, we may think of them as expressing the confidence that he himself, as loving, and beloved of, God, would be delivered from destruction, both now and hereafter. St. Peter had learnt to interpret the words as having received a higher fulfilment. Christ was, in this sense, as well as in that expressed by the other word, “the Holy One” of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are, the Holy One of God.">Mark 1:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm" title="Saying, Let us alone; what have we to do with you, you Jesus of Nazareth? are you come to destroy us? I know you who you are; the Holy One of God.">Luke 4:34</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-26.htm" title="For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the heavens;">Hebrews 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/15-4.htm" title="Who shall not fear you, O Lord, and glorify your name? for you only are holy: for all nations shall come and worship before you; for your judgments are made manifest.">Revelation 15:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-5.htm" title="And I heard the angel of the waters say, You are righteous, O Lord, which are, and were, and shall be, because you have judged thus.">Revelation 16:5</a>, this very word is applied to Christ. The Hebrew text of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-10.htm" title="For you will not leave my soul in hell; neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Psalm 16:10</a> presents the various reading of “the holy ones,” as if referring to the “saints that are upon the earth,” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>. The LXX., which St. Peter follows, gives the singular, which is indeed essential to his argument, and this is also the reading of the Masoretic text. The Greek word for “corruption” ranges in its meaning from “decay” to “destruction.” The Hebrew to which it answers is primarily the “pit” of the grave, and not “corruption,” or “wasting away.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou wilt not leave my soul - The word "soul," with us, means "the thinking, the immortal part of man," and is applied to it whether existing in connection with the body or separate from it. The Hebrew word translated "soul" here, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh, however, may mean "spirit, mind, life," and may denote here nothing more than "me" or "myself." It means, properly, "breath"; then "life," or "the vital principle, a living being"; then "the soul, the spirit, the thinking part." Instances where it is put for the individual himself, meaning "me" or "myself" may be seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-1.htm">Psalm 11:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/35-3.htm">Psalm 35:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-7.htm">Psalm 35:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-21.htm">Job 9:21</a>. There is no clear instance in which it is applied to the soul in its separate state, or disjoined from the body. In this place it must be explained in part by the meaning of the word hell. If that means grave, then this word probably means "me"; thou wilt not leave me in the grave. The meaning probably is, "Thou wilt not leave me in Sheol, neither," etc. The word "leave" here means, "Thou wilt not resign me to, or wilt not give me over to it, to be held under its power."<p>In hell -  - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  eis Hadou. The word "hell," in English, now commonly denotes "the place of the future eternal punishment of the wicked." This sense it has acquired by long usage. It is a Saxon word, derived from helan, "to cover," and denotes literally "a covered or deep place" (Webster); then "the dark and dismal abode of departed spirits"; and then "the place of torment." As the word is used now by us, it by no means expresses the force of the original; and if with this idea we read a passage like the one before us, it would convey an erroneous meaning altogether, although formerly the English word perhaps expressed no more than the original. The Greek word "Hades" means literally "a place devoid of light; a dark, obscure abode"; and in Greek writers was applied to the dark and obscure regions where disembodied spirits were supposed to dwell. It occurs only eleven times in the New Testament. In this place it is the translation of the Hebrew &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  Sheowl.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-13.htm">Revelation 20:13-14</a>, it is connected with death: "And death and hell (Hades) delivered up the dead which were in them"; "And death and hell (Hades) were cast into the lake of fire." See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm">Revelation 6:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-18.htm">Revelation 1:18</a>, "I have the keys of hell and death." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a> it means the grave: "O grave (Hades), where is thy victory?" In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-23.htm">Matthew 11:23</a> it means a deep, profound place, opposed to an exalted one; a condition of calamity and degradation, opposed to former great prosperity: "Thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be thrust down to hell" (Hades). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-23.htm">Luke 16:23</a> it is applied to the place where the rich man was after death, in a state of punishment: "In hell (Hades) he lifted up his eyes, being in torments." In this place it is connected with the idea of suffering, and undoubtedly denotes a place of punishment. The Septuagint has used this word commonly to translate the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  She&#768;owl.<p>Once it is used as a translation of the phrase "the stones of the pit" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-19.htm">Isaiah 14:19</a>; twice to express silence, particularly the silence of the grave <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/94-17.htm">Psalm 94:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-17.htm">Psalm 115:17</a>; once to express the Hebrew for "the shadow of death" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; and sixty times to translate the word Sheol. It is remarkable that it is never used in the Old Testament to denote the word &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;  qeber, which properly denotes "a grave or sepulchre." The idea which was conveyed by the word Sheol, or Hades, was not properly a grave or sepulchre, but that dark, unknown state, including the grave, which constituted the dominions of the dead. What idea the Hebrews had of the future world it is now difficult to explain, and is not necessary in the case before us. The word originally denoting simply "the state of the dead, the insatiable demands of the grave," came at last to be extended in its meaning, in proportion as they received new revelations or formed new opinions about the future world. Perhaps the following may be the process of thought by which the word came to have the special meanings which it is found to have in the Old Testament:<p>(1) The word "death" and the grave &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;  qeber would express the abode of a deceased body in the earth.<p>(2) man has a soul, a thinking principle, and the inquiry must arise, What will be its state? Will it die also? The Hebrews never appear to have believed that. Will it ascend to heaven at once? On that subject they had at first no knowledge. Will it go at once to a place of happiness or of torment? Of that, also, they had no information at first Yet they supposed it would live; and the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;  Sheowl expressed just this state - the dark, unknown regions of the dead; the abode of spirits, whether good or bad; the residence of departed people, whether fixed in a permanent habitation, or whether wandering about. As they were ignorant of the size and spherical structure of the earth, they seem to have supposed this region to be situated in the earth, far below us, and hence, it is put in opposition to heaven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/139-8.htm">Psalm 139:8</a>, "If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there; if I make my bed in hell (Sheol), behold, thou art there"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-2.htm">Amos 9:2</a>. The most common use of the word is, therefore, to express those dark regions, the lower world, the region of ghosts, etc. Instances of this, almost without number, might be given. See a most striking and sublime instance of this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; "Hell from beneath is moved to meet thee," etc.; where the assembled dead are represented as being agitated in all their vast regions at the death of the King of Babylon.<p>(3) the inquiry could not but arise whether all these beings were happy. This point revelation decided; and it was decided in the O d Testament. Yet this word would better express the state of the wicked dead than the righteous. It conveyed the idea of darkness, gloom, wandering; the idea of a sad and unfixed abode, unlike heaven. Hence, the word sometimes expresses the idea of a place of punishment: <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>, "The wicked shall be turned into hell," etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-11.htm">Proverbs 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-14.htm">Proverbs 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-20.htm">Proverbs 27:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/26-6.htm">Job 26:6</a>. While, therefore, the word does not mean properly a grave or a sepulchre, it does mean often "the state of the dead," without designating whether in happiness or woe, but implying the continued existence of the soul. In this sense it is often used in the Old Testament, where the Hebrew word is Sheol, and the Greek Hades: <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>, "I will go down into the grave, unto my son, mourning" I will go down to the dead, to death, to my son, still there existing; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-38.htm">Genesis 42:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/44-29.htm">Genesis 44:29</a>, "He shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm">Numbers 16:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-33.htm">Numbers 16:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-6.htm">1 Kings 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-9.htm">1 Kings 2:9</a>; etc. etc. in the place before us, therefore, the meaning is simply, thou wilt not leave me among the dead. This conveys all the idea. It does not mean literally the grave or the sepulchre; that relates only to the body. This expression refers to the deceased Messiah. Thou wilt not leave him among the dead; thou wilt raise him up. It is from this passage, perhaps, aided by two others (<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-7.htm">Romans 10:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-19.htm">1 Peter 3:19</a>), that the doctrine originated that Christ "descended," as it is expressed in the Creed, "into hell"; and many have invented strange opinions about his going among lost spirits. The doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church has been that he went to purgatory, to deliver the spirits confined there. But if the interpretation now given be correct, then it will follow:<p>(1) That nothing is affirmed here about the destination of the human soul of Christ after his death. That he went to the region of the dead is implied, but nothing further.<p>(2) It may be remarked that the Scriptures affirm nothing about the state of his soul in that time which intervened between his death and resurrection. The only intimation which occurs on the subject is such as to leave us to suppose that he was in a state of happiness. To the dying thief he said, "This day shalt thou be with me in paradise." When Jesus died, he said, "It is finished"; and he doubtless meant by that that his sufferings and toils for man's redemption were at an end. All suppositions of any toils or pains after his death are fables, and without the slightest warrant in the New Testament.<p>Thine Holy One - The word in the Hebrew which is translated here "Holy One" properly denotes "One who is tenderly and piously devoted to another," and corresponds to the expression used in the New Testament, "my beloved Son." It is also used, as it is here by the Septuagint and by Peter, to denote "One that is holy, that is set apart to God." In this sense it is applied to Christ, either as being set apart to this office, or as so pure as to make it proper to designate him by way of eminence the Holy One, or the Holy One of God. It is several times used as the wellknown designation of the Messiah: <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>, "I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of God"; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-14.htm">Acts 3:14</a>, "But ye denied the Holy One, and the just," etc. See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-35.htm">Luke 1:35</a>, "That holy thing that is born of thee shall be called the Son of God."<p>To see corruption - To see corruption is to experience it, to be made partakers of it. The Hebrews often expressed the idea of experiencing anything by the use of words pertaining to the senses, as, to taste of death, to see death, etc. Corruption here means putrefaction in the grave. The word which is used in the Psalm, &#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;  shachath, is thus used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, "I have said to corruption, thou art my father," etc. The Greek word used here properly denotes this. Thus, it is used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34-37</a>. This meaning would be properly suggested by the Hebrew word, and thus the ancient versions understood it. The meaning implied in the expression is, that he of whom the Psalm was written should be restored to life again; and this meaning Peter proceeds to show that the words must have. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. wilt not leave my soul in hell&#8212;in its disembodied state (see on [1938]Lu 16:23).<p>neither &#8230; suffer thine Holy One to see corruption&#8212;in the grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My soul; </span> that is, me: the soul is put for the person, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm" title="Let every soul be subject to the higher powers.

This is an apostrophe, or an address to his Father, who he believed would not leave his soul, as separate from his body, in Hades, in the invisible world of souls, in the place where the souls of departed saints are, but would quickly return it to its body, and reunite them; or else, that he would not leave his dead body, for so sometimes signifies; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> in the grave; which is no unusual sense of  see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-38.htm">Genesis 42:38</a> that is, so long as to be corrupted and putrefy, as the next clause shows: <p>neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption. The character of an "Holy One" well agrees with Christ, both as God, or with respect to his divine nature, holiness being a perfection in it, and in which he is glorious; and as man, he being holy in his nature, harmless in his life and conversation: all his doctrines were pure and holy, and so were all his works; and all his administrations in the discharge of every of his office; and he is the efficient cause and lain of all the holiness of his people; they are sanctified in him, and by him, and have all their sanctification from him. The word may be rendered, "thy merciful", or "bountiful one"; and such Christ is, a merciful, as well as faithful high priest; and who has shown great compassion both to the bodies and souls of men, and has been very beneficent and liberal in the distributions of his grace and goodness. Now, though he died, and was laid in the grave, and buried, yet God would not suffer him to lie there so long as to be corrupted and putrefied, which is the sense of seeing corruption: and so the Jews themselves explain the last clause of the preceding verse, in connection with this, "my flesh shall rest in hope", that no worm or maggot should have power over it, or corrupt it, <p>"Seven fathers (they say (x)) dwell in eternal glory, and there is no , "worm or maggot", rules over them; and these are they, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Moses, and Aaron, and Amram their father; and there are that say also David, as it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1</a>, "therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth, my flesh also shall rest in hope". <p>And which sense also is mentioned by one of their commentators of note (y), who thus paraphrases the words: <p>"whilst I am alive it shall rest safely, for thou wilt deliver me from all hurt; and in the mystical sense, or according to the Midrash, after death; intimating, that no maggot or worm should have power over him; <p>which was not true of David, but is of the Messiah, <p>(x) Massecheth Derech Eretz Zuta, c. 1. fol. 19. 1.((y) Kimchi in Psal. xvi. 9. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Because thou wilt not <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.</span><p>(t) You will not allow me to remain in the grave.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-27.htm" title="Because you will not leave my soul in hell, neither will you suffer your Holy One to see corruption.">Acts 2:27</a>.

W.H[127]; <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Briggs, <span class="ital">Messianic Prophecies</span>, p. 24; although in T.R. as usually in Attic, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ᾅδου</span>, <span class="ital">sc.</span>, <span class="greekheb">δόμον</span>.

(O.T.) the word “suffer” is retained, but in R.V. (N.T.) we find “thou wilt not give,” the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">נתן</span> being used in this sense to permit, to suffer, to let, like <span class="greekheb">δίδωμι</span> and <span class="ital">dare</span>, Viteau, <span class="ital">Le Grec du N. T.</span>, p. 156 (1893).—<span class="greekheb">τὸν ὅσιόν σου</span>: the Hebrew <span class="ital">Châsîd</span> which is thus sometimes translated in the LXX (Vulgate, <span class="ital">Sanctus</span>) is often rendered “thy beloved one,” and the word denotes not only one who is godly and pious, but also one who is the object of Jehovah’s loving-kindness. The word might well be used of Him, Who was not only the Holy One of God, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀγαπητὸς υἱός</span>, “the beloved Son”. On the word <span class="ital">Châsîd</span> see Kirkpatrick, <span class="ital">Psalms</span>, Appendix, p. 221.—<span class="greekheb">ἰδεῖν διαφθοράν</span>: “corruption” or “the pit,” margin R.V. (O.T.), but in the N.T. simply “corruption” (A. and R.V.), Vulgate, <span class="ital">corruptio</span>. In the LXX the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">שַׁחַת</span> is often rendered <span class="greekheb">διαφθορά</span>, “corruption,” as if derived from <span class="greekheb">שָׁחַת διαφθείρειν</span>, “to corrupt”; not, however, in the sense of corruption, putridity, but of destruction. The derivation however is probably from <span class="greekheb">שׁוּחַ</span>, to sink down, hence it means a pit, and sometimes a sepulchre, a grave, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-10.htm" title="Hear, O LORD, and have mercy on me: LORD, be you my helper.">Psalm 30:10</a>; Psalm 55:24, so here “to see the grave,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to die and be buried, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-10.htm" title="For he sees that wise men die, likewise the fool and the brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.">Psalm 49:10</a> (see Robinson’s <span class="ital">Gesenius</span>, p. 1053, note, twenty-sixth edition). Dr. Robertson Smith maintains that there are two Hebrew words the same in form but different in origin, one masculine = <span class="ital">putrefaction or corruption</span>, the other feminine = the <span class="ital">deep</span> or the <span class="ital">pit</span>. So far he agrees with the note in <span class="ital">Gesenius, u. s.</span>, that the word <span class="greekheb">διαφθορά</span> should here be rendered by the latter, the <span class="ital">pit</span>, but he takes the rendering, the <span class="ital">deep</span> or the <span class="ital">pit</span>, as an epithet not of the grave but of Sheol or Hades (see <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, p. 354, 1876, the whole paper on “The Sixteenth Psalm,” by Dr. R. Smith, should be consulted, and p. 354 compared with the note in <span class="ital">Gesenius</span>), and this view certainly seems to fit in better with the parallelism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[127] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">in hell</span>] The Greek word here and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-31.htm" title="He seeing this before spoke of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.">Acts 2:31</a></span> is <span class="ital">Hades</span>, and signifies <span class="ital">the unseen world</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither wilt thou suffer</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">give</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thine Holy One</span>] The Hebrew word in the Psalm contains the idea of <span class="ital">beloved</span>, as well as <span class="ital">godly</span> or <span class="ital">holy</span>.

The "hell" of the A.V. is the exact English representative of <span class="greek">&#x1f85;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>. The article in the Creed, "He descended into hell," is based upon this text especially, the other two alleged in support of it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18, 19</a>) being less conclusive (see Pearson on the Creed, art. 5.).

The Hebrew word always means <span class="accented">a pit</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;</span>); but the LXX. here render it <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f71;</span>, as if from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5d7;&#x5b7;&#x5ea;</span> (in Pihel, to destroy, waste; in Hophal and Niphal, to be corrupted, spoilt, to rot). In the A.V. it is rendered <span class="accented">corruption</span>, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-14.htm">Job 17:14</a>, where it answers to "the worms," in the parallel clause. It is very probable that the LXX. are right. Nothing is more common than for Hebrew verbs to take the meaning of verbs with similar radicals. <span class="cmt_word">Holy One</span>. So the LXX. and the Keri of the Hebrew text. But the Cethib has <span class="accented">Holy Ones</span> in the plural. It is obvious that the singular, <span class="accented">Holy One</span>, agrees far better with the singulars which precede and follow <span class="accented">it - my</span> heart, <span class="accented">my</span> glory, <span class="accented">my</span> flesh, <span class="accented">my</span> soul, thou wilt show me - than the plural, which is entirely out of place. The two clauses taken together show the full liberation of Christ from the dominion of death - that of his human soul from bell, and that of his body from the grave before it saw corruption (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34-37</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Leave (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., leave behind.<p>Suffer (&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., give. </body></html>
