Not a few scholars, however, render the words “exalted to the right hand of God.”<p><span class= "bld">Having received of the Father.</span>—The words of St. Peter, obviously independent as they are of the Gospel of St. John, present a striking agreement with our Lord’s language as recorded by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-26.htm" title="But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send to you from the Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceeds from the Father, he shall testify of me:">John 15:26</a>).

Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore, being by the right hand - The right hand among the Hebrews was often used to denote "power"; and the expression here means, not that he was exalted to the right hand of God. but by his power.

David &#8230; is &#8230; dead and buried, &c.&#8212;Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this was palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take David himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the whole argument of the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in Jesus, of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him. A further illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from Ps 110:1, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the right hand of God, </span> that is, by the power of God spoken after the manner of men, the right hand being that we commonly do any thing with.

Christ had told His disciples that the Father would send this gift upon them in answer to His prayer. “I will pray the Father and he shall give you another Comforter … he shall teach you all things” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-16.htm" title="And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever;">John 14:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-26.htm" title="But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatever I have said to you.">John 14:26</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he hath shed forth</span>] Better, <span class="bld">he hath poured forth</span>. Thus the fulfilment of the prophecy is, as in the original, described by the same word which is put into the mouth of the prophet in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in the last days, said God, I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:">Acts 2:17</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">see and hear</span>] It would seem from this that the appearance, like as of fire, which rested upon each of them, remained visible for some time, thus making it apparent how different this was from any meteoric flashes into which some have endeavoured to explain away the miracle which St Luke describes.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm" title="Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost, he has shed forth this, which you now see and hear.">Acts 2:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῇ δεξιᾷ</span>) So also in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-31.htm" title="Him has God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.">Acts 5:31</a>, “Him hath God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour.” The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">לימין </span>is rendered by the LXX. usually <span class="greekheb">ἐκ δεξιῶν</span>; and so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>, the passage to which Peter refers, and yet uses the expression <span class="greekheb">τῇ δεξιᾷ</span>, which is found once in the LXX., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-12.htm" title="That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an everlasting name?">Isaiah 63:12</a>.

The neuter gender in Greek is expressed by the masculine in Latin. Moreover the phrase is absolute, this (<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span>), elegantly denoting the newness (the unprecedented character) of this unspeakable gift.[16] Irenæu[17] has <span class="greekheb">νῦν</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>, which has been omitted by some.[18]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΒΛΈΠΕΤΕ ΚΑῚ ἉΚΌΥΕΤΕ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">ye see and hear</span>) Ye have testimonies to the facts which are not to be ‘mocked’ at (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm" title="Others mocking said, These men are full of new wine.">Acts 2:13</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[16] <span class="greekheb">Τοῦτο ὃ</span> is the reading of ABC and D corrected.
