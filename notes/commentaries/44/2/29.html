Josephus relates that vast treasures were buried with him (<span class= "ital">Ant. vii.</span> 15, § 4), and that John Hyrcanus opened one of the chambers of the tomb, and took out three thousand talents to pay the tribute demanded by Antiochus the Pious (<span class= "ital">Ant. xiii.</span> 8, § 4). Herod the Great also opened it and found no money, but gold and silver vessels in abundance. The tradition was that he sought to penetrate into the inner vault, in which the bodies of David and Solomon were resting, and was deterred by a flame that issued from the recess (<span class= "ital">Ant. xvi.</span> 7, § 1). It is difficult to understand how such a treasure could have escaped the plunderer in all the sieges and sacks to which Jerusalem had been exposed; but it is possible that its fame as a holy place may have made it, like the temples at Delphi and Ephesus, a kind of bank of deposit, in which large treasures in coin or plate were left for safety, and many of these, in the common course of things, were never claimed, and gradually accumulated. The monuments now known as the “tombs of the kings” on the north side of the city, though identified by De Sauley with the sepulchres of the house of David, are of the Roman period, and are outside the walls. David and his successors were probably buried in a vault on the eastern hill, in the city of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-10.htm" title="So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.">1Kings 2:10</a>), within the range of the enclosure now known as the <span class= "ital">Haram</span> Area.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-29.htm" title="Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day....">Acts 2:29-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Men and brethren </span>— Thus he addresses himself to them, with a title of respect; <span class="ital">let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David</span> — Let it be no offence to you, if I tell you that David cannot be understood here as speaking of himself, but of the Messiah to come.

Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men and brethren - This passage of the Psalms Peter now proves could not relate to David, but must have reference to the Messiah. He begins his argument in a respectful manner, addressing them as his brethren, though they had just charged him and the others with intoxication. Christians should use the usual respectful forms of salutation, whatever contempt and reproaches they may meet with from opposers.<p>Let me freely speak - That is, "It is lawful or proper to speak with boldness, or openly, respecting David." Though he was eminently a pious man, though venerated by us all as a king, yet it is proper to say of him that he is dead, and has returned to corruption. This was a delicate way of expressing high respect for the monarch whom they all honored, and yet evinced boldness in examining a passage of Scripture which probably many supposed to have reference solely to him.<p>Of the patriarch David - The word "patriarch" properly means "the head or ruler of a family"; and then "the founder of a family, or an illustrious ancestor." It was commonly applied to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by way of eminence, the illustrious founders of the Jewish nation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm">Hebrews 7:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-8.htm">Acts 7:8-9</a>. It was also applied to the heads of the families, or the chief men of the tribes of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>, etc. It was thus a title of honor, denoting "high respect." Applied to David, it means that he was the illustrious head or founder of the royal family, and the word is expressive of Peter's intention not to say anything disrespectful of such a king, at the same time that he freely canvassed a passage of Scripture which had been supposed to refer to him.<p>Dead and buried - The record of that fact they had in the O d Testament. There had been no pretence that he had risen, and therefore the Psalm could not apply to him.<p>His sepulchre is with us - Is in the city of Jerusalem., Sepulchres wore commonly situated without the walls of cities and the limits of villages. The custom of burying in towns was not commonly practiced. This was true of other ancient nations as well as the Hebrews, and is still in Eastern countries, except in the case of kings and very distinguished men, whose ashes are permitted to rest within the walls of a city: <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-3.htm">1 Samuel 28:3</a>, "Samuel was dead ...and Israel ...buried him in Ramah, in his own city"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-18.htm">2 Kings 21:18</a>, "Manasseh ...was buried in the garden of his own house"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm">2 Chronicles 16:14</a>, Asa was buried in the city of David; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-20.htm">2 Kings 14:20</a>. David was buried in the city of David <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-10.htm">1 Kings 2:10</a>, with his fathers; that is, on Mount Zion, where he built a city called after his name, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>. Of what form the tombs of the kings were is not certainly known. It is almost certain, however, that they would be constructed in a magnificent manner.<p>The tombs were commonly excavations from rocks, or natural caves; and sepulchres cut out of the solid rock, of vast extent, are Known to have existed. The following account of the tomb called "the sepulchre of the kings" is abridged from Maundrell: "The approach is through an entrance cut out of a solid rock, which admits you into an open court about 40 paces square, cut down into the rock. On the south side is a portico nine paces long and four broad, hewn likewise out of the solid rock. At the end of the portico is the descent to the sepulchres. The descent is into a room about 7 or 8 yards square, cut out of the natural rock. From this room there are passages into six more, all of the same fabric with the first. In every one of these rooms, except the first, were coffins placed in niches in the sides of the chamber," etc. (Maundrell's Travels). If the tombs of the kings were of this form, it is clear that they were works of great labor and expense.<p>Probably, also, there were, as there are now, costly and splendid monuments erected to the memory of the mighty dead. The following extract from "The Land and the Book," and cut on the next page (from Williams' Holy City), will illustrate the usual construction of tombs: "The entire system of rooms, niches, and passages may be comprehended at once by an inspection of the plan of the Tombs of the Judges near Jerusalem. The entrance faces the west, and has a vestibule (a) 13 feet by 9. Chamber (B), nearly 20 feet square, and 8 high. The north side is seen in elevation in Fig. 2, and shows two tiers of niches, one over the other, not often met with in tombs. There are seven in the lower tier, each 7 feet long, 20 inches wide, and nearly 3 feet high. The upper tier has three arched recesses, and each recess has two niches. From this room (B) doors lead out into chambers (C and D), which have their own special system of niches, or Ioculi, for the reception of the bodies, as appears on the plan. I have explored scores of sepulchres at Ladakiyeh closely resembling this at Jerusalem, and there are many in the plain and on the hillsides above us here at Sidon of the same general form chambers within chambers, and each with niches for the dead, variously arranged according to taste or necessity."<p>These tombs are about a mile northwest of Jerusalem. "The tombs which are commonly called the 'Tombs of the Kings' are in an olivegrove about half a mile north of the Damascus Gate, and a few rods east of the great road to Nablus. A court is sunk in the solid rock about 90 feet square and 20 deep. On the west side of this court is a sort of portico, 39 feet long, 17 deep, and 15 high. It was originally ornamented with grapes, garlands, and festoons, beautifully done on the cornice; and the columns in the center, and the pilasters at the corners, appear to have resembled the Corinthian order. A very low door in the south end of the portico opens into the ante-chamber - 19 feet square, and 7 or 8 high. From this three passages conduct into other rooms, two of them, to the south, having five or six crypts. A passage also leads from the west room down several steps into a large vault running north, where are crypts parallel to the sides. These rooms are all cut in rock intensely hard, and the entrances were originally closed with stone doors, made with panels and hung on stone hinges, which are now all broken. The whole series of tombs indicates the hand of royalty and the leisure of years, but by whom and for whom they were made is a mere matter of conjecture. I know no good reason for ascribing them to Helena of Adiabene. Most travelers and writers are inclined to make them the sepulchres of the Asmonean kings" (The Land and the Book, vol. 2, pp. 487, 488). The site of the tomb of David is no longer known.<p>Unto this day - That the sepulchre of David was well known and honored is clear from Josephus (Antiq., book 7, chapter 15, section 3): "He (David) was buried by his son Solomon in Jerusalem with great magnificence, and with all the other funeral pomps with which kings used to be buried. Moreover, he had immense wealth buried with him: for one thousand and three hundred years afterward Hyrcanus the high priest, when he was besieged by Antiochus, and was desirous of giving him money to raise the siege, opened one room of David's sepulchre and took out three thousand talents. Herod, many years afterward, opened another room, and took away a great deal of money," etc. See also Antiq., book 13, chapter 8, section 4. The tomb of a monarch like David would be well known and had in reverence. Peter might, then, confidently appeal to their own belief and knowledge that David had not been raised from the dead. No Jew believed or supposed it. All, by their care of his sepulchre, and by the honor with which they regarded his grave, believed that he had returned to corruption. The Psalm, therefore, could not apply to him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-36. David &#8230; is &#8230; dead and buried, &c.&#8212;Peter, full of the Holy Ghost, sees in this sixteenth Psalm, one Holy Man, whose life of high devotedness and lofty spirituality is crowned with the assurance, that though He taste of death, He shall rise again without seeing corruption, and be admitted to the bliss of God's immediate presence. Now as this was palpably untrue of David, it could be meant only of One other, even of Him whom David was taught to expect as the final Occupant of the throne of Israel. (Those, therefore, and they are many, who take David himself to be the subject of this Psalm, and the words quoted to refer to Christ only in a more eminent sense, nullify the whole argument of the apostle). The Psalm is then affirmed to have had its only proper fulfilment in Jesus, of whose resurrection and ascension they were witnesses, while the glorious effusion of the Spirit by the hand of the ascended One, setting an infallible seal upon all, was even then witnessed by the thousands who stood listening to Him. A further illustration of Messiah's ascension and session at God's right hand is drawn from Ps 110:1, in which David cannot be thought to speak of himself, seeing he is still in his grave.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Men and brethren; </span> St. Peter bespeaks this attention and favour, intimating he was one of the same nation with themselves, than which nothing could more recommend him.

But by this it appeared, that David did not speak these things concerning himself, who must needs have seen corruption, (themselves being witnesses), for on that account they respected his tomb, as being the repository of his ashes. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Men and brethren, let me freely speak unto you,.... The apostle calls the Jews, brethren, whom he before only styled men of Judea, and men of Israel, because they were his brethren according to the flesh, as many of them afterwards were in a spiritual relation; and the rather he adds this affectionate appellation to soften their minds, and prepare them to receive the account he was about to give of David, and of his prophecy of the Messiah, and his resurrection; in which he used much freedom of speech, consistent with truth, good sense, and strong reasoning; which he thought might be allowed to take, and they would not be displeased at, in discoursing to them <p>of the patriarch David; who was a "head of the fathers", as the Syriac and Arabic versions render it; a prince of the tribes of Israel; one of the greatest kings the tribes of Israel ever had; and therefore this name well becomes him; though it is more commonly given to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the heads of the twelve tribes: <p>that he is both dead, and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day; it is a plain case, and a certain matter of fact, which nobody disputes or denies, that David really died, and was laid in the grave, and that his monument, or tomb, was still extant, so that he was not risen from the dead; and therefore the above citation could not respect him, but another, even the Messiah, and had been literally fulfilled in Jesus. The Jews say (z), that David died on the day of Pentecost; which was the very day on which Peter was now preaching; he was buried in Jerusalem, and his sepulchral monument was in being when Peter said these words. And Josephus relates (a), that the sepulchre of David was opened by Hyrcanus, who took out of it three thousand talents; and that it was afterwards opened by Herod (b): which, if true, may serve to render credible what Peter says concerning its continuance to that day. Though it may be questioned whether any such treasure was ever in it, or taken out of it; and still less credible is the account which R. Benjamin (c) gives of two men in his time, who, under the wall of Zion, found a cave, which led them to a large palace built on pillars of marble, and covered with gold and silver; and within it was a table, and a golden sceptre, and a crown of gold; and this, says the author, was the sepulchre of David, king of Israel, <p>(z) T.

He speaks of David in terms which indicate his respect for his name and memory, and as Bengel well says, “est igitur hoc loco <span class="greekheb">προθεραπεία</span>, prævia sermonis mitigatio” (“est hæc <span class="greekheb">προθερ</span>. ut aiunt rhetores,” Blass, <span class="ital">in loco</span>).—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ πατριάρχου</span>, the name is emphatically used in the N.T. of Abraham; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-4.htm" title="Now consider how great this man was, to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.">Hebrews 7:4</a> (properly the <span class="greekheb">ἄρχων</span> (<span class="ital">auctor</span>), <span class="greekheb">πατριᾶς</span>), and of the sons of Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-8.htm" title="And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so Abraham begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat the twelve patriarchs....">Acts 7:8-9</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> 4Ma 7:19, used of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. In the LXX it is used of the “heads of the fathers’ houses,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-9.htm" title="And their brothers, according to their generations, nine hundred and fifty and six. All these men were chief of the fathers in the house of their fathers.">1 Chronicles 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm" title="These likewise cast lots over against their brothers the sons of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger brothers.">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>, in a comparatively lower sense. Here used, as a term of high honour, of David, regarded as the ancestor of the kingly race. See on the word and its formation, Kennedy, <span class="ital">Sources of New Testament Greek</span>, p. 114.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι καὶ ἐτελεύτησε καὶ ἐτάφη</span>: “that he both died and was buried,” R.V. St. Peter states notorious facts, and refers to them in a way which could not wound the susceptibilities of his hearers, whilst he shows them that David’s words were not exhausted in his own case. The argument is practically the same as that of St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-36.htm" title="For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell on sleep, and was laid to his fathers, and saw corruption:">Acts 13:36</a> from the same Psalm.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ τὸ μνῆμα αὐτοῦ ἐστιν ἐν ἡμῖν</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, in Jerusalem, the mention of the tomb emphasises the fact and certainty of the death of David, and implies that <span class="ital">his</span> body had seen corruption. That David’s tomb was shown in the time of Nehemiah we know from <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-16.htm" title="After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the half part of Bethzur, to the place over against the sepulchers of David, and to the pool that was made, and to the house of the mighty.">Nehemiah 3:16</a>. From Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, vii., 15, 3; xiii., 8, 4; <span class="ital">B. J.</span>, i., 2, 5, we learn that Solomon had buried a large treasure in the tomb, and that on that account one of its chambers had been broken open by Hyrcanus, and another by Herod the Great. According to Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xvi., 7, 1, Herod, not content with rifling the tomb, desired to penetrate further, even as far as the bodies of David and Solomon, but a flame burst forth and slew two of his guards, and the king fled. To this attempt the Jewish historian attributed the growing troubles in Herod’s family. In the time of Hadrian the tomb is said to have fallen into ruins. Whatever its exact site, it must have been within the walls, and therefore could not correspond with the so called “tombs of the kings” which De Saulcy identified with it. Those tombs are outside the walls, and are of the Roman period (Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. i., vol. i., p. 276, E.T., “David,” B.D.2). Wetstein, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, quotes the testimony of Maundrell as to the sepulchres of David and his family being the only sepulchres within the walls. St. Jerome, <span class="ital">Epist.</span>, xlvi., writing to Marcella, expresses a hope that they might pray together in the mausoleum of David; so that at the end of the fourth century tradition must still have claimed to mark the spot.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>.

The sepulchre of the House of David was a famous object in the Holy City. Among the marvels of Jerusalem mentioned in the <span class="ital">Aboth de-Rabbi Nathan</span> (c. 35), we are told, “There are no graves made in Jerusalem except the tombs of the house of David and of Huldah the Prophetess, which have been there from the days of the first prophets.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the burial of David in Zion, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-10.htm" title="So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.">1 Kings 2:10</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm" title="Nevertheless David took the strong hold of Zion: the same is the city of David.">2 Samuel 5:7</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm" title="Men and brothers, let me freely speak to you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.">Acts 2:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξὸν</span>) viz. <span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span>, <span class="ital">let it be allowed to me</span>.

It is a title of dignity, signifying the head of a house. It seems to be here applied to David, because he is spoken of as head of the family from which Christ sprang. Abraham was the head of the whole Hebrew race: "Abraham our father." The twelve patriarchs were the heads of their respective tribes. The LXX. use the word <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> as the rendering of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b9;&#x5d0;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span> "chief of the fathers' houses" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/24-31.htm">1 Chronicles 24:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-8.htm">2 Chronicles 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/26-12.htm">2 Chronicles 26:12</a>); which they elsewhere render by <span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x1fb6;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-25.htm">Exodus 6:25</a>, etc.). In common parlance, the term is also applied to those chief persons who lived before the time of Moses, and have their record in his books. <span class="cmt_word">His tomb is with us</span>, etc. Josephus speaks of David's tomb (calling it, as St. Peter here does, his <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fc6;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) as consisting of several chambers, and relates how one of these chambers was opened by the high priest Hyrcanus, who took from it three thousand talents of gold to give to Antiochus Pins, who was at that time laying siege to Jerusalem. He adds that another chamber was opened later by King Herod, who abstracted a great quantity of golden ornaments from it; but that neither of them penetrated to the vaults where the bodies of David and Solomon were deposited, because the entrance to them was so carefully concealed. He further mentions that Herod, having been terrified by the bursting out of flames, which stopped his further progress, built a most costly marble monument at the entrance of the tomb ('Jud. Ant.,' 7. 15:3; 13. 8:4; 16. 7:1). For the sense, supply "and therefore he could not be speaking of himself."
