The coincidence is not without its force as bearing on the genuineness both of the speech and of the letter. It has now become the habit of the Apostle’s mind to trace the working of a divine purpose, which men, even when they are most bent on thwarting it, are unconsciously fulfilling. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>, he had seen that purpose in the treachery of Judas; he sees it now in the malignant injustice of priests and people.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have taken</span>. . . .—Better, <span class= "ital">ye took, and by lawless hands crucified and slew.</span> Stress is laid on the priests having used the hands of one who was “without law” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-21.htm" title="To them that are without law, as without law, (being not without law to God, but under the law to Christ,) that I might gain them that are without law.">1Corinthians 9:21</a>), a heathen ruler, to inflict the doom which they dared not inflict themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-23.htm" title="Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, you have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain:...">Acts 2:23-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Him, being delivered </span>— Unto death, by God his heavenly Father, who not only permitted him to be put to death, but <span class="ital">delivered him up for us all. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a>; devoted and gave him up; and yet he was approved of God: and there was nothing in this that implied, in any degree, the disapproving of him. For it was done by <span class="ital">the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God </span>— In infinite wisdom, and for holy ends, in which, and in the means leading to them, Jesus himself freely and fully concurred. For it was necessary that thus divine justice should be satisfied, God and man reconciled, sinners saved, and Christ himself glorified. It must be observed, the apostle here anticipates an objection. Why did God suffer such a person to be so treated? Did he not know what wicked men intended to do? And had he not power to prevent it? Yea, he knew all that those wicked men intended to do. And he had power to blast all their designs in a moment. But he did not exert that power, because he <span class="ital">so loved the world! </span>Because it was the determinate counsel of his love to redeem mankind from eternal death, by the death of his only-begotten Son. <span class="ital">Ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified, </span>&c. — Thus the apostle speaks, because neither God’s foreknowing what they would do, nor his designing that his Son should be offered as a sacrifice to expiate the sins of mankind, nor his bringing unspeakable and everlasting good out of this fact, could in the least excuse their sin who were agents in it; for it was their voluntary act and deed, proceeding from a principle morally evil, and therefore they are justly said to have perpetrated it with wicked hands. It is probable some of those who had cried, <span class="ital">Crucify him, crucify him, </span>or who had been otherwise aiding and abetting in the murder, were here present, and that Peter knew it. Be this as it may, it was justly looked upon as a national act, because done by the vote of the great council, and by the voice of the great crowd, clamouring for his blood. He charges it particularly upon them, as a part of the nation on which it would be peculiarly visited, the more effectually to bring them to repentance and faith, because that was the only way to distinguish themselves from the guilty that were about to perish in their sins, and to discharge themselves from the guilt of so dreadful a crime, and save themselves from the coming vengeance due to it. <span class="ital">Whom God hath raised up </span>— Whose honour God hath abundantly vindicated, and to whose innocence, truth, and dignity he hath borne a most glorious testimony; <span class="ital">having loosed the pains of death </span>— Or the bonds in which he lay, when the pains of death had done their work upon him; <span class="ital">because it was not possible that he </span>— The Prince of life, and a person who had never sinned, and therefore was not liable to the penalty of death, only due to sinners; <span class="ital">should be </span>finally <span class="ital">holden of it </span>— Or detained under its power. The word <span class="greekheb">ωδινας</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">pains, </span>properly means, the pains of a woman in travail, an expression which seems to be here used to signify the agony which Christ suffered in his soul before he was nailed to the cross: and the extreme anguish he afterward endured, before he bowed his head and gave up the ghost. The word, however, seems to be used by the LXX. for <span class="ital">cords </span>and <span class="ital">bands, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-4.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.">Psalm 18:4</a>; and Dr. Hammond thinks, that from them the apostle here used it in the same sense, to which, indeed, the metaphor of being <span class="ital">held </span>and <span class="ital">loosing </span>best agrees. Christ was imprisoned for our debt, was thrown into the bonds of death; but divine justice being satisfied, it was not possible he should be detained there, either by right or by force, for he had life in himself, and in his own power, and had conquered the prince of death.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:22-36 From this gift of the Holy Ghost, Peter preaches unto them Jesus: and here is the history of Christ. Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Him, being delivered - &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  ekdoton. This word, delivered, is used commonly of those who are surrendered or delivered into the hands of enemies or adversaries. It means that Jesus was surrendered, or given up to his enemies by those who should have been his protectors. Thus, he was delivered to the chief priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-33.htm">Mark 10:33</a>. Pilate released Barabbas, and delivered Jesus to their will, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-25.htm">Luke 23:25</a>. He was delivered unto the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-32.htm">Luke 18:32</a>; the chief priests delivered him to Pilate, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>; and Pilate delivered him to be crucified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-26.htm">Matthew 27:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-16.htm">John 19:16</a>. In this manner was the death of Jesus accomplished, by being surrendered from one tribunal to another, and one demand of his countrymen to another, until they succeeded in procuring his death. It may also be implied here that he was given or surrendered by God Himself to the hands of people. Thus, he is represented to have been given by God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/4-9.htm">1 John 4:9-10</a>. The Syriac translates this, "Him, who was destined to this by the foreknowledge and will of God, you delivered into the hands of wicked men," etc. The Arabic, "Him, delivered to you by the hands of the wicked, you received, and after you had mocked him you slew him."<p>By the determinate counsel - The word translated "determinate" - &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;  &#x3c9;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;  te&#772; ho&#772;rismene&#772; - mean, properly, "what is defined, marked out, or bounded; as, to mark out or define the boundary of a field," etc. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-1.htm">Romans 1:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/10-42.htm">Acts 10:42</a>, it is translated "ordained of God"; denoting His purpose that it should be so, that is, that Jesus should be the Judge of quick and dead; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-22.htm">Luke 22:22</a>, "The Son of man goeth as it is determined of him," that is, as God has purposed or determined beforehand that he should go; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm">Acts 11:29</a>, "The disciples ...determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea," that is, they resolved or purposed beforehand to do it; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-26.htm">Acts 17:26</a>, "God ...'hath determined' the times before appointed and fixed," etc. In all these places there is the idea of a purpose, intention, or plan implying intention, and marking out or fixing the boundaries to some future action or evens. The word implies that the death of Jesus was resolved by God before it took place. And this truth is established by all the predictions made in the Old Testament, and by the Saviour himself. God was not compelled to give up his Son. There was no claim on him for it. He had a right, therefore, to determine when and how it should be done. The fact, moreover, that this was predicted, shows that it was fixed or resolved on. No event can be foretold, evidently, unless it be certain that it will take place. The event, therefore, must in some way be fixed or resolved on beforehand,<p>Counsel - &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;  boule&#772;. This word properly denotes "purpose, decree, will." It expresses the act of the mind in willing, or the purpose or design which is formed. Here it means the purpose or will of God; it was his plan or decree that Jesus should be delivered: <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/4-28.htm">Acts 4:28</a>, "For to do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  he&#772; boule&#772; sou determined before to be done"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-11.htm">Ephesians 1:11</a>, "Who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>, "God willing ...to show ...the immutability of his counsel." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-27.htm">Acts 20:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-51.htm">Luke 23:51</a>. The word here, therefore, proves that Jesus was delivered by the deliberate purpose of God; that it was according to his previous intention and design. The reason why this was insisted on by Peter was that he might convince the Jews that Jesus was not delivered by weakness, or because he was unable to rescue himself. Such an opinion would have been inconsistent with the belief that he was the Messiah. It was important, then, to assert the dignity of Jesus, and to show that his death was in accordance with the fixed design of God, and therefore that it did not interfere in the least with his claims to be the Messiah. The same thing our Saviour has himself expressly affirmed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/19-10.htm">John 19:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-18.htm">John 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>.<p>Foreknowledge - This word denotes "the seeing beforehand of an event yet to take place." It implies:<p>1. Omniscience; and,<p>2. That the event is fixed and certain.<p>To foresee a contingent event, that is, to foresee that an event will take place when it may or may not take place, is an absurdity. Foreknowledge, therefore, implies that for some reason the event will certainly take place. What that reason As, however, God is represented in the Scriptures as purposing or determining future events; as they could not be foreseen by him unless he had so determined, so the word sometimes is used in the sense of determining beforehand, or as synonymous with decreeing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm">Romans 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-2.htm">Romans 11:2</a>. In this place the word is used to denote that the delivering up of Jesus was something more than a bare or naked decree. It implies that God did it according to his foresight of what would be the best time, place, and manner of its being done. It was not the result merely of will; it was will directed by a wise foreknowledge of what would be best. And this is the case with all the decrees of God. It follows from this that the conduct of the Jews was foreknown. God was not disappointed in anything respecting their treatment of his Son, nor will he be disappointed in any of the actions of people. Notwithstanding the wickedness of the world, his counsel shall stand, and he will do all his pleasure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-10.htm">Isaiah 46:10</a>.<p>Ye have taken - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57</a>. Ye Jews have taken. It is possible that some were present on this occasion who had been personally concerned in taking Jesus, and many who had joined in the cry, "Crucify him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-18.htm">Luke 23:18-21</a>. It was, at any rate, the act of the Jewish people by which this had been done. This was a striking instance of the fidelity of that preaching which says, as Nathan did to David, "Thou art the man!" Peter, once so timid that he denied his Lord, now charged this atrocious crime to his countrymen, regardless of their anger and his own danger. He did not deal in general accusations, but brought the charges home, and declared that they were the people who had been concerned in this amazing crime. No preaching can be successful that does not charge to people their personal guilt, and that does not fearlessly proclaim their ruin and danger.<p>By wicked hands - Greek: "through or by the hands of the lawless or wicked." This refers, doubtless, to Pilate and the Roman soldiers, through whose instrumentality this had been done. The reasons for supposing that this is the true interpretation of the passage are these:<p>(1) The Jews had not the power of inflicting death themselves.<p>(2) the term used here, "wicked," &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  anomo&#772;n, is not applicable to the Jews, but to the Romans. It properly means lawless, or those who had not the Law, and is often applied to the pagan, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-12.htm">Romans 2:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-14.htm">Romans 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-21.htm">1 Corinthians 9:21</a>.<p>(3) the punishment which was inflicted was a Roman punishment.<p>(4) it was a matter of fact that the Jews, though they had condemned him, yet had not put him to death themselves, but had demanded it of the Romans. But, though they had employed the Romans to do it, still they were the prime movers in the deed; they had plotted, and compassed, and demanded his death, and they were, therefore, not the less guilty. The maxim of the common law and of common sense is, "He who does a deed by the instrumentality of another is responsible for it." It was from no merit of the Jews that they had not put him to death themselves. It was simply because the power was taken away from them.<p>Have crucified - Greek: "Having affixed him to the cross, ye have put him to death." Peter here charges the crime fully on them. Their guilt was not diminished because they had employed others to do it.

The fact that St. Peter thus describes the Jewish people as the actual murderers of Jesus is not a proof that in such language we have an instance of anti-Judaism quite inconsistent with the historical truth of the speech (Baur, Renan, Overbeck), but the Apostle sees vividly before his eyes essentially the same crowd at the Feast as had demanded the Cross of Jesus before the judgment-seat of Pilate, Nösgen, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 103.—<span class="greekheb">ὃν ὁ Θεὸς ἀνέστησε</span>, “est hoc summum orationis,” Blass, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-32.htm" title="And we are his witnesses of these things; and so is also the Holy Ghost, whom God has given to them that obey him.">Acts 5:32</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-22.htm" title="Beginning from the baptism of John, to that same day that he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness with us of his resurrection.">Acts 1:22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-24.htm" title="Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death: because it was not possible that he should be held of it.">Acts 2:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">λύσας τὰς ὠδῖνας τοῦ θαν</span>.: R.V. “pangs” instead of “pains” (all previous versions) approaches nearer to the literal form of the word—“birth-pangs,” the resurrection of Christ being conceived of as a birth out of death, as the Fathers interpreted the passage. The phrase is found in the Psalms, LXX <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/17-4.htm" title="Concerning the works of men, by the word of your lips I have kept me from the paths of the destroyer.">Psalm 17:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/114-3.htm" title="The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.">Psalm 114:3</a>, but it is most probable that the LXX has here mistaken the force of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">חבל</span> which might mean “birth-pangs,” or the cords of a hunter catching his prey. In the Hebrew version the parallelism, such a favourite figure in Hebrew poetry, decides in favour of the latter meaning, as in R.V. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/18-4.htm" title="The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid....">Psalm 18:4-5</a> (LXX 18), Sheol and Death are personified as hunters lying in wait for their prey with nooses and nets (Kirkpatrick, <span class="ital">Psalms</span>, <span class="ital">in loco</span>, the word <span class="greekheb">מוֹקְשֵׁי</span> meaning snares by which birds or beasts are taken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-5.htm" title="Can a bird fall in a snare on the earth, where no gin is for him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?">Amos 3:5</a>)). In the previous verse the parallelism is also maintained if we read “the waves of death” (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-5.htm" title="When the waves of death compassed me, the floods of ungodly men made me afraid;">2 Samuel 22:5</a>) “compassed me, the <span class="ital">floods</span> of ungodliness made me afraid”. It is tempting to account for the reading <span class="greekheb">ὠδῖνας</span> by supposing that St. Luke had before him a source for St. Peter’s speech, and that he had given a mistaken rendering of the word <span class="greekheb">חבל</span>. But it would certainly seem that <span class="greekheb">λύσας</span> and <span class="greekheb">κρατεῖσθαι</span> are far more applicable to the idea of the hunter’s cords, in which the Christ could not be bound, since He was Himself the Life. A similar mistake in connection with the same Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">חבל</span> may possibly occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-3.htm" title="For when they shall say, Peace and safety; then sudden destruction comes on them, as travail on a woman with child; and they shall not escape.">1 Thessalonians 5:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm" title="And take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come on you unawares.">Luke 21:34</a>. There is no occasion to find in the word any reference to the death-pains of Christ (so Grotius, Bengel), or to render <span class="greekheb">ὠδῖνες</span> <span class="ital">pains</span> and <span class="ital">snares</span> (Olshausen, Nösgen), and it is somewhat fanciful to explain with St. Chrysostom (so Theophylact and Oecumenius) <span class="greekheb">ὁ θάνατος ὤδινε κατέχων αὐτὸν καὶ τὰ δεινὰ ἔπασχε</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καθότι</span>: only found in St. Luke, in Gospel twice, and in Acts four times (Friedrich); generally in classical Greek <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὅ τι</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/1-12.htm" title="Because I remembered God with all my heart.">Tob 1:12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/13-4.htm" title="There declare his greatness, and extol him before all the living: for he is our Lord, and he is the God our Father for ever.">Tob 13:4</a>).—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἦν δυνατὸν</span> … <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span>: the words primarily refer to the proof which St. Peter was about to adduce from prophecy, and the Scripture could not be broken.
