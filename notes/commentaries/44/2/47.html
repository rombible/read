The verb “added” is in the tense which, like the adverb “daily,” implies a continually recurring act. “The Lord” is probably used here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm" title="For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the LORD our God shall call.">Acts 2:39</a>, in its generic Old Testament sense, rather than as definitely applied to Christ.

It should, however, be stated in fairness that all the versions from Tyndale onward, including the Rhemish, give the same rendering. Wiclif alone gives nearly the true meaning, “them that were made safe.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/acts/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Acts<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>PETER’S FIRST SERMON<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A PURE CHURCH AN INCREASING CHURCH<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm" title="Praising God, and having favor with all the people.

V.} You observe that the principal alterations of these words in the Revised Version are two: the one the omission of ‘the church,’ the other the substitution of ‘were being saved’ for ‘such as should be saved.’ The former of these changes has an interest as suggesting that at the early period referred to the name of ‘the church’ had not yet been definitely attached to the infant community, and that the word afterwards crept into the text at a time when ecclesiasticism had become a great deal stronger than it was at the date of the writing of the Acts of the Apostles. The second of the changes is of more importance. The Authorised Version’s rendering suggests that salvation is a future thing, which in one aspect is partially true. The Revised Version, which is also by far the more literally accurate, suggests the other idea, that salvation is a process going on all through the course of a Christian man’s life. And that carries very large and important lessons.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. I ask you to notice here, first, the profound conception which the writer had of the present action of the ascended Christ. ‘The Lord added to them day by day those that were being saved.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>Then Christ {for it is He that is here spoken of as the Lord}, the living, ascended Christ, was present in, and working with, that little community of believing souls. You will find that the thought of a present Saviour, who is the life-blood of the Church on earth, and the spring of action for all good that is done in it and by it, runs through the whole of this Book of the Acts of the Apostles. The keynote is struck in its first verses: ‘The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began to do and to teach, until the day in which He was taken up.’ That is the description of Luke’s Gospel, and it implies that the Acts of the Apostles is the <span class="ital">second</span> treatise, which tells all that Jesus continued to do and teach <span class="ital">after</span> that He was taken up. So the Lord, the ascended Christ, is the true theme and hero of this book. It is He, for instance, who sends down the Spirit on the Day of Pentecost. It is He whom the dying martyr sees ‘standing at the right hand of God,’ ready to help. It is He who appears to the persecutor on the road to Damascus. It is He who sends Paul and his company to preach in Europe. It is He who opens hearts for the reception of their message. It is He who stands by the Apostle in a vision, and bids him ‘be of good cheer,’ and go forth upon his work. Thus, at every crisis in the history of the Church, it is the Lord-that is to say, Christ Himself-who is revealed as working in them and for them, the ascended but yet eve-present Guide, Counsellor, Inspirer, Protector, and Rewarder of them that put their trust in Him. So here it is He that ‘adds to the Church daily them that were being saved.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> I believe, dear brethren, that modern Christianity has far too much lost the vivid impression of this present Christ as actually dwelling and working among us. What is good in us and what is bad in us conspire to make us think more of the past work of an ascended Christ than of the present work of an indwelling Christ. We cannot think too much of that Cross by which He has laid the foundation for the salvation and reconciliation of all the world; but we may easily think too exclusively of it, and so fix our thoughts upon that work which He completed when on Calvary He said, ‘It is finished!’ as to forget the continual work which will never be finished until His Church is perfected, and the world is redeemed. If we are a Church of Christ at all, we have Christ in very deed among us, and working through us and on us. And unless we have, in no mystical and unreal and metaphorical sense, but in the simplest and yet grandest prose reality, that living Saviour here in our hearts and in our fellowship, better that these walls were levelled with the ground, and this congregation scattered to the four winds of heaven. The present Christ is the life of His Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Notice, and that but for a moment, for I shall have to deal with it more especially at another part of this discourse,-the specific action which is here ascribed to Him. <span class="ital">He</span> adds to the Church, not <span class="ital">we</span>, not our preaching, not our eloquence, our fervour, our efforts. These may be the weapons in His hands, but the hand that wields the weapon gives it all its power to wound and to heal, and it is Christ Himself who, by His present energy, is here represented as being the Agent of all the good that is done by any Christian community, and the Builder-up of His Churches, in numbers and in power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> It is His will for, His ideal of, a Christian Church, that continuously it should be gathering into its fellowship those that are being saved. That is His meaning in the establishment of His Church upon earth, and that is His will concerning it and concerning us, and the question should press on every society of Christians: Does our reality correspond to Christ’s ideal? Are we, as a portion of His great heritage, being continually replenished by souls that come to tell what God has done for them? Is there an unbroken flow of such into what we call our communion? I speak to you members of this church, and I ask you to ponder the question,-Is it so? and the other question, If it is not so, wherefore? ‘The Lord added daily,’- why does not the Lord add daily to us?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Let us go to the second part of this text, and see if we can find an answer. Notice how emphatically there is brought out here the attractive power of an earnest and pure Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>My text is the end of a sentence. What is the beginning of the sentence? Listen,-’All that believed were together, and had all things common; and sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need. And they, continuing daily with one accord in the Temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart, praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added.’ Yes; of course. Suppose you were like these people. Suppose this church and congregation bore stamped upon it, plain and deep as the broad arrow of the king, these characteristics-manifest fraternal unity, plain unselfish unworldliness, habitual unbroken devotion, gladness which had in it the solemnity of Heaven, and a transparent simplicity of life and heart, which knew nothing of by-ends and shabby, personal motives or distracting duplicity of purpose-do you not think that the Lord would add to you daily such as should be saved? Or, to put it into other words, wherever there is a little knot of men obviously held together by a living Christ, and obviously manifesting in their lives and characters the likeness of that Christ transforming and glorifying them, there will be drawn to them-by natural gravitation, I was going to say, but we may more correctly say, by the gravitation which is natural in the supernatural realm-souls that have been touched by the grace of the Lord, and souls to whom that grace has been brought the nearer by looking upon <span class="ital">them</span>. Wherever there is inward vigour of life there will be outward growth; and the Church which is pure, earnest, living will be a Church which spreads and increases.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Historically, it has always been the case that in God’s Church seasons of expansion have followed upon seasons of deepened spiritual life on the part of His people. And the only kind of growth which is wholesome, and to be desired in a Christian community, is growth as a consequence of the revived religiousness of the individuals who make up the community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And just in like manner as such a community will draw to it men who are like-minded, so it will repel from it all the formalist people. There are congregations that have the stamp of worldliness so deep upon them that any persons who want to be burdened with as little religion as may be respectable will find themselves at home there. And I come to you Christian people here, for whose Christian character I am in some sense and to some degree responsible, with this appeal: Do you see to it that, so far as your influence extends, this community of ours be such as that half-dead Christians will never think of coming near us, and those whose religion is tepid will be repelled from us, but that they who love the Lord Jesus Christ with earnest devotion and lofty consecration, and seek to live unworldly and saint-like lives, shall recognise in us men lik-minded, and from whom they may draw help. I beseech you-if you will not misunderstand the expression-make your communion such that it will repel as well as attract; and that people will find nothing here to draw them to an easy religion of words and formalism, beneath which all vermin of worldliness and selfishness may lurk, but will recognise in us a church of men and women who are bent upon holiness, and longing for more and more conformity to the divine Master.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now, if all this be true, it is possible for worldly and stagnant communities calling themselves ‘Churches’ to thwart Christ’s purpose, and to make it both impossible and undesirable that He should add to them souls for whom He has died. It is a solemn thing to feel that we may clog Christ’s chariot-wheels, that there may be so little spiritual life in us, as a congregation, that, if I may so say, He dare not intrust us with the responsibility of guarding and keeping the young converts whom He loves and tends. We may not be fit to be trusted with them, and that may be why we do not get them. It may not be good for them that they should be dropped into the refrigerating atmosphere of such a church, and that may be why they do not come.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Depend upon it, brethren, that, far more than my preaching, your lives will determine the expansion of this church of ours. And if my preaching is pulling one way and your lives the other, and I have half an hour a week for talk and you have seven days for contradictory life, which of the two do you think is likely to win in the tug? I beseech you, take the words that I am now trying to speak, to yourselves. Do not pass them to the man in the next pew and think how well they fit him, but accept them as needed by you. And remember, that just as a bit of sealing-wax, if you rub it on your sleeve and so warm it, develops an attractive power, the Church which is warmed will draw many to itself. If the earlier words of this context apply to any Christian community, then certainly its blessed promise too will apply to it, and to such a church the Lord will ‘add day by day them that are being saved.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. And now, lastly, observe the definition given here of the class of persons gathered into the community.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>I have already observed, in the earlier portion of this discourse, that here we have salvation represented as a process, a progressive thing which runs on all through life. In the New Testament there are various points of view from which that great idea of salvation is represented. It is sometimes spoken of as past, in so far as in the definite act of conversion and the first exercise of faith in Jesus Christ the whole subsequent evolution and development are involved, and the process of salvation has its beginning then, when a man turns to God. It is sometimes spoken of as present, in so far as the joy of deliverance from evil and possession of good, which is God, is realised day by day. It is sometimes spoken of as future, in so far as all the imperfect possession and pre-libations of salvation which we taste here on earth prophesy and point onwards to their own perfecting in the climax of heaven. But all these three points of view, past, present, and future, may be merged into this one of my text, which speaks of every saint on earth, from the infantile to the most mature, as standing in the same row, though at different points; walking on the same road, though advanced different distances; all participant of the same process of ‘being saved.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Through all life the deliverance goes on, the deliverance from sin, the deliverance from wrath. The Christian salvation, then, according to the teaching of this emphatic phrase, is a process begun at conversion, carried on progressively through the life, and reaching its climax in another state. Day by day, through the spring and the early summer, the sun shines longer in the sky, and rises higher in the heavens; and the path of the Christian is as the shining light. Last year’s greenwood is this year’s hardwood; and the Christian, in like manner, has to ‘grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord and Saviour.’ So these progressively, and, therefore, as yet imperfectly, saved people, were gathered into the Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now I have but two things to say about that. If that be the description of the kind of folk that come into a Christian Church, the duties of that Church are very plainly marked. And the first great one is to see to it that the community help the growth of its members. There are Christian Churches-I do not say whether ours is one of them or not-into which, if a young plant is brought, it is pretty sure to be killed. The temperature is so low that the tender shoots are nipped as with frost, and die. I have seen people, coming all full of fervour and of faith, into Christian congregations, and finding that the average round them was so much lower than their own, that they have cooled down after a time to the fashionable temperature, and grown indifferent like their brethren. Let us, dear friends, remember that a Christian Church is a nursery of imperfect Christians, and, for ourselves and for one another, try to make our communion such as shall help shy and tender graces to unfold themselves, and woo out, by the encouragement of example, the lowest and the least perfect to lofty holiness and consecration like the Master’s.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And if I am speaking to any in this congregation who hold aloof from Christian fellowship for more or less sufficient reasons, let me press upon them, in one word, that if they are conscious of a possession, however imperfect, of that incipient salvation, their place is thereby determined, and they are doing wrong if they do not connect themselves with some Christian Communion, and stand forth as members of Christ’s Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> And now one last word. I have tried to show you that salvation, in the New Testament, is regarded as a process. The opposite thing is a process too. There is a very awful contrast in one of Paul’s Epistles. ‘The preaching of the Cross is to them <span class="ital">who are in the act of perishing</span> foolishness; unto us who are <span class="ital">being saved</span>, it is the power of God.’ These two processes start, as it were, from the same point, one by slow degrees and almost imperceptible motion, rising higher and higher, the other, by slow degrees and almost unconscious descent, sliding steadily and fatally downward ever further and further. And my point now is that in each of us one or other of these processes is going on. Either you are slowly rising or you are slipping down. Either a larger measure of the life of Christ, which is salvation, is passing into your hearts, or bit by bit you are dying like some man with creeping paralysis that begins at the extremities, and with fell, silent, inexorable footstep, advances further and further towards the citadel of the heart, where it lays its icy hand at last, and the man is dead. You are either ‘being saved’ or you are ‘perishing.’ No man becomes a devil all at once, and no man becomes an angel all at once. Trust yourself to Christ, and He will lift you to Himself; turn your back upon Him, as some of you are doing, and you will settle down, down, down in the muck and the mire of your own sensuality and selfishness, until at last the foul ooze spreads over your head, and you are lost in the bog for ever.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:42-47 In these verses we have the history of the truly primitive church, of the first days of it; its state of infancy indeed, but, like that, the state of its greatest innocence. They kept close to holy ordinances, and abounded in piety and devotion; for Christianity, when admitted in the power of it, will dispose the soul to communion with God in all those ways wherein he has appointed us to meet him, and has promised to meet us. The greatness of the event raised them above the world, and the Holy Ghost filled them with such love, as made every one to be to another as to himself, and so made all things common, not by destroying property, but doing away selfishness, and causing charity. And God who moved them to it, knew that they were quickly to be driven from their possessions in Judea. The Lord, from day to day, inclined the hearts of more to embrace the gospel; not merely professors, but such as were actually brought into a state of acceptance with God, being made partakers of regenerating grace. Those whom God has designed for eternal salvation, shall be effectually brought to Christ, till the earth is filled with the knowledge of his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Praising God - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-53.htm">Luke 24:53</a>.<p>And having favour - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm">Luke 2:52</a>.<p>With all the people - That is, with the great mass of the people; with the people generally.

It does not express any purpose that they should be saved, but simply the fact that they were those who would be, or who were about to be saved. It is clear, however, from this expression, that those who became members of the church were those who continued to adorn their profession, or who gave proof that they were sincere Christians. It is implied here, also, that those who are to be saved will join themselves to the church of God. This is everywhere required; and it constitutes one evidence of piety when they are willing to face the world, and give themselves at once to the service of the Lord Jesus. Two remarks may be made on the last verse of this chapter; one is, that the effect of a consistent Christian life will be to command the respect of the world; and the other is, that the effect will be continually to increase the number of those who shall be saved. In this case they were daily added to it; the church was constantly increasing; and the same result may be expected in all cases where there is similar zeal, self-denial, consistency, and prayer.<p>We have now contemplated the foundation of the Christian church and the first glorious revival of religion. This chapter deserves to be profoundly studied by all ministers of the gospel, as well as by all who pray for the prosperity of the kingdom of God. It should excite our fervent gratitude that God has left this record of the first great work of grace, and our earnest prayers that He would multiply and extend such scenes until the earth shall be filled with His glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>47.

This confession would have been a thing of no importance, if it had only presented itself as a naked declaration, and would never in such a case have been able to form a community that would spread itself over the whole Roman empire. It acquired its value only through the power of the Holy Ghost, passing from the apostles as they preached to the hearers; for He brought the confession from the very hearts of men (1Co 12:3), and like a burning flame made their souls glow with love. By the power of this Spirit, therefore, we behold the first Christians not only in a state of active fellowship, but also internally changed: the narrow views of the natural man are broken through; they have their possessions in common, and they regard themselves as one family" [Olshausen].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Praising God; </span> acknowledging him who teacheth one to want, and another to abound. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Having favour with all the people; </span> that is, generally to be understood, amongst them that continued yet without the pale of the church; the goodness, meekness, and patience of the apostles, and the rest of the believers, did wonderfully prevail to beget a good opinion of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord added to the church; </span> salvation is (to be sure) only from the Lord; not Peter’s sermons, no, nor the miracles of fiery cloven tongues, and the rushing mighty wind, could have converted any, but Dei ti endon, that which was signified there, viz. the powerful operation of the Spirit of God in their hearts. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Praising God,....

The expression is rightly translated in R.V. (so too in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-15.htm" title="For we are to God a sweet smell of Christ, in them that are saved, and in them that perish:">2 Corinthians 2:15</a>.

(On the phrase as distinguished from those used elsewhere in Acts and in 1 Cor., see Grimm-Thayer, <span class="ital">sub v.</span>, <span class="greekheb">γλῶττα</span> 2, and Blass, <span class="ital">Acta Apost.</span>, p. 50, “<span class="greekheb">γλῶττα</span> etiam ap. att. per se est lingua peregrina vel potius vocabulum peregrinum”.) Wendt and Matthias, who have recently given us a lengthy account of the events of the first Christian Pentecost, both hold that this speaking with tongues is introduced by St. Luke himself, and that it is a legendary embellishment from his hand of what actually took place; the speaking with tongues at Pentecost was simply identical with the same phenomenon described elsewhere in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-14.htm" title="For the body is not one member, but many.">1 Corinthians 12:14</a>. This is plain from St. Peter’s own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm" title="For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?">Acts 11:17</a>; so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>, the speaking with tongues is the immediate result of the outpouring of the Spirit. So too Wendt lays stress upon the fact that St. Paul says <span class="greekheb">λαλεῖν γλώσσαις</span> or <span class="greekheb">γλώσση</span>, but not <span class="greekheb">λαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γλ</span>. The former was evidently the original mode of describing the phenomenon, to which Luke recurs in his own description in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-46.htm" title="For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,">Acts 10:46</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-6.htm" title="And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.">Acts 19:6</a>, whereas in the passage before us his language represents the miraculous enhancement of the events of Pentecost. M’Giffert, in the same way, thinks that the writer of Acts, far removed moved from the events, could hardly avoid investing even the common phenomena of the <span class="ital">Glossolalia</span> with marvel and mystery. Wendt however admits that this embellishment was already accomplished by Christian tradition before Luke. But if St. Luke must have had every means of knowing from St. Paul the character of the speaking with tongues at Corinth, it does not seem unfair to maintain that he also had means of knowing from the old Palestinian Christians, who had been in union with the Church at Jerusalem from the beginning, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, from a John Mark, or a Mnason (<span class="greekheb">ἀρχαῖος μαθητής</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>), the exact facts connected with the great outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost (Schmid, <span class="ital">Biblische Theologie</span>, pp. 278, 279). But it is further to be noted that Wendt by no means denies that there was a miraculous element, as shown in the outpouring of the Spirit, in the events of the Pentecostal Feast, but that he also considers it quite unlikely that Luke’s introduction of a still further miraculous element was prompted by a symbolising tendency, a desire to draw a parallel between the Christian Pentecost and the miraculous delivery of the Law, according to the Jewish tradition that the one voice which proceeded from Sinai divided into seventy tongues, and was heard by the seventy nations of the world, each in their mother tongue (so Zeller, Pfleiderer, Hilgenfeld, Spitta, Jüngst and Matthias, and so apparently Clemen in his “Speaking with Tongues,” <span class="ital">Expository Times</span>, p. 345, 1899). But in the first place there is no convincing evidence at the early date of the Christian Pentecost of any connection in Jewish tradition between the Feast of Pentecost and the giving of the Law on Sinai (<span class="ital">cf.</span> Schmid, <span class="ital">Biblische Theologie</span>, p. 286; Hamburger, <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie des Judentums</span>, i., 7, 1057, and Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 330), and it is significant that neither Philo nor Josephus make any reference to any such connection; and in the next place it is strange, as Wendt himself points out, that if Luke had started with the idea of the importance of any such symbolism, no reference should be made to it in the subsequent address of Peter, whereas even in the catalogue of the nations there is no reference of any kind to the number seventy; the number actually given, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm" title="Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,">Acts 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-11.htm" title="Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our tongues the wonderful works of God.">Acts 2:11</a>, might rather justify the farfetched notice of Holtzmann (<span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 331), that a reference is meant to the sixteen grandsons of Noah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/10-1.htm" title="Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham, and Japheth: and to them were sons born after the flood....">Genesis 10:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-6.htm" title="And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.">Genesis 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-21.htm" title="To Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.">Genesis 10:21</a>. Certainly <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/2-2.htm" title="For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;...">Hebrews 2:2-4</a> cannot, as Schmid well points out against Holtzmann, lead to any such connection of ideas as the <span class="greekheb">μερισμοὶ πνεύμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἁγ</span>. are evidently the distribution of the gifts of the Spirit. We may readily admit that the miracle on the birthday of the Christian Church was meant to foreshadow the universal progress of the new faith, and its message for all mankind without distinction of nation, position, or age. But even if the Jewish tradition referred to above was in existence at this early date, we have still to consider whether the narrative in Acts could possibly be a copy of it, or dependent upon it. According to the tradition, a voice was to be expected from Heaven which would be understood by different men in their mother tongues, but in our narrative the Apostles themselves speak after the manner of men in these tongues. For to suppose that the Apostles all spoke one and the same language, but that the hearers were enabled to understand these utterances, each in his own language, is not only to do violence to the narrative, but simply to substitute one miraculous incident for another. Nor again, as Wendt further admits, is there any real ground for seeing in the miraculous event under consideration a cancelling of the confusion of tongues at Babel which resulted from rebellion against God, for the narrative does not contain any trace of the conception of a unity of language to which the Jewish idea appears to have tended as a contrast to the confusion of Babel (Test. xii., Patr., <span class="ital">Jud.</span>, xxv). The unity is not one of uniformity of speech but of oneness of Spirit and in the Spirit. At the same time there was a peculiar fitness in the fact that the first and most abundant bestowal of this divine gift should be given at a Feast which was marked above all others by the presence of strangers from distant lands, that a sign should thus be given to them that believed not, and that the firstfruits of a Gentile harvest should be offered by the Spirit to the Father (Iren., <span class="ital">Adv. Haer</span>, iii., 17), an assurance to the Apostles of the greatness and universality of the message which they were commissioned to deliver. But there is no reason to suppose that this power Of speaking in foreign languages was a permanent gift. In the first place the Greek language was known throughout the Roman Empire, and in the next place <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-11.htm" title="And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.">Acts 14:11</a> (see <span class="ital">in loco</span>) seems to forbid any such view. The speaking with tongues in Acts 2 and in other passages of the N.T. may be classed as identical in so far as each was the effect of the divine <span class="greekheb">Πνεῦμα</span>, each a miraculous spiritual gift, marking a new epoch of spiritual life. But in Acts we have what we have not elsewhere—the speaking in foreign tongues—this was not the case in Corinth; there the speaking with tongues was absolutely unintelligible, it could not be understood without an interpreter, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, without another gift of the divine Spirit, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, interpretation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm" title="To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another divers kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-30.htm" title="Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?">1 Corinthians 12:30</a> (the word <span class="ital">unknown</span> inserted in A.V. in 1 Corinthians 14 is unfortunate), and the fact that the Apostle compares the speaking with tongues to a speaking in foreign languages shows that the former was itself no speaking in foreign tongues, since two identical things do not admit of comparison (Schmid, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 288, 289).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[136] Westcott and Hort’s <span class="ital">The New Testament in Greek:</span> Critical Text and Notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Peter might well express his belief that Cornelius and those who spoke with tongues had also received the Holy Ghost, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-44.htm" title="While Peter yet spoke these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.">Acts 10:44</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-17.htm" title="For as much then as God gave them the like gift as he did to us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?">Acts 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-24.htm" title="For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith: and much people was added to the Lord.">Acts 11:24</a>, <span class="ital">in loco</span>; but it does not follow that the gift bestowed upon them was identical with that bestowed at Pentecost—there were diversities of gifts from the bounty of the One Spirit.

Not that St. Luke’s glowing and repeated description (on St. Luke’s way of sometimes repeating himself as here, see Harris, <span class="ital">Four Lectures on the Western Text</span>, p. 85) is to be confined to the exercise of mere almsgiving on the part of the Church. Both those who had, and those who had not, were alike the inheritors of a kingdom which could only be entered by the poor in spirit, alike members of a family and a household in which there was one Master, even Christ, in Whose Name all who believed were brethren. In this poverty of spirit, in this sense of brotherhood, “the poor man knew no shame, the rich no haughtiness” (Chrys.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But whilst men were called upon to give ungrudgingly, they were not called upon to give of necessity: what each one had was still his own, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ὑπάρχοντα αὐτῷ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-32.htm" title="And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul: neither said any of them that ought of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.">Acts 4:32</a>, although not even one (<span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ εῖς</span>) of them reckoned it so; the daily ministration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a> seems to show that no equal division of property amongst all was intended; the act of Barnabas was apparently one of charity rather than of communism, for nothing is said of an absolute surrender of all that he had; the act of Ananias and Sapphira was entirely voluntary, although it presented itself almost as a duty (Ramsay, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>); Mark’s mother still retains her home at Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>, and it would seem that Mnason too had a dwelling there (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-16.htm" title="There went with us also certain of the disciples of Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an old disciple, with whom we should lodge.">Acts 21:16</a>). At Joppa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.">Acts 9:39</a>, and at Antioch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29</a>, there was evidently no absolute equality of earthly possessions—Tabitha helps the poor out of her own resources, and every man as he prospered sent his contributions to the Church at Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is sometimes urged that this enthusiasm of charity and of the spirit (<span class="greekheb">ἐνθουσιασμός</span>, as Blass calls it), which filled at all events the Church at Jerusalem, was due to the expectation of Christ’s immediate return, and that in the light of that event men regarded lands and possessions as of no account, even if ordinary daily work was not neglected (O. Holtzmann, <span class="ital">Neutest. Zeitgeschichte</span>, p. 233). But it is strange that if this is the true account of the action of the Church at Jerusalem, a similar mode of life and charity should not have found place in other Churches, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, in the Church at Thessalonica, where the belief in Christ’s speedy return was so overwhelmingly felt (Felten). No picture could be more extraordinary than that drawn by O. Holtzmann of the Christian Church at Jerusalem, driven by the voice of Christian prophets to enjoin an absolutely compulsory community of goods in expectation of the nearness of the Parousia, and of Ananias and Sapphira as the victims of this tyrannical product of fanaticism and overwrought excitement. It is a relief to turn from such a strange perversion of the narrative to the enthusiastic language in which, whilst insisting on its idealising tendency, Renan and Pfleiderer alike have recognised the beauty of St. Luke’s picture, and of the social transformation which was destined to renew the face of the earth, which found its pattern of serving and patient love in Jesus the Friend of the poor, whose brotherhood opened a place of refuge for the oppressed, the destitute, the weak, who enjoyed in the mutual love of their fellows a foretaste of the future kingdom in which God Himself will wipe all tears from their eyes. Whatever qualifications must be made in accepting the whole description given us by Renan and Pfleiderer, they were at least right in recognising the important factor of the Person of Jesus, and the probability that during His lifetime He had Himself laid the foundations of the social movement which so soon ennobled and blessed His Church. It is far more credible that the disciples should have continued the common life in which they had lived with their Master than that they should have derived a social system from the institutions of the Essenes. There is no proof of any historical connection between this sect and the Apostolic Church, nor can we say that the high moral standard and mode of common life adopted by the Essenes, although in some respects analogous to their own, had any direct influence on the followers of Christ. Moreover, with points of comparison, there were also points of contrast. St. Luke’s notice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-46.htm" title="And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart,">Acts 2:46</a>, that the believers continued steadfastly in the Temple, stands out in contrast to the perpetual absence of the Essenes from the Temple, to which they sent their gifts (Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xviii. 2, 5); the common meals of the Essene brotherhood naturally present a likeness to St. Luke’s description of the early Christian Church, but whilst the Essenes dined together, owing to their scrupulosity in avoiding all food except what was ceremonially pure, the Christians saw in every poor man who partook of their common meal the real Presence of their Lord. Of all contemporary sects it may no doubt be said that the Christian society resembled most nearly the Essenes, but with this admission Weizsäcker well adds: “The Essenes, through their binding rules and their suppression of individualism, were, from their very nature, an order of limited extent. In the new Society the moral obligation of liberty reigned, and disclosed an unlimited future,” <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, i., 58 (E.T.). It is often supposed that the after-poverty of the Church in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>, etc., was the result of this first enthusiasm of love and charity, and that the failure of a community of goods in the mother city prevented its introduction elsewhere. But not only is the above view of the “communism” of the early Christians adverse to this supposition, but there were doubtless many causes at work which may account for the poverty of the Saints in Jerusalem, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Rendall, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, Nov., 1893, p. 322. The collection for the Saints, which occupies such a prominent place in St. Paul’s life and words, may not have been undertaken for any exceptional distress as in the earlier case of the famine in Judæa, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>, but we cannot say how severely the effects of the famine may have affected the fortunes of the Jerusalem Christians. We must too take into account the persecution of the Christians by their rich neighbours; the wealthy Sadducees were their avowed opponents. From the first it was likely that the large majority of the Christians in Jerusalem would possess little of this world’s goods, and the constant increase in the number of the disciples would have added to the difficulty of maintaining the disproportionate number of poor. But we cannot shut our eyes to the fact that there was another and a fatal cause at work—love itself had grown cold—the picture drawn by St. James in his Epistle is painfully at variance with the golden days which he had himself seen, when bitter jealousy and faction were unknown, for all were of one heart and one soul, Zahn, <span class="ital">Skizzen aus dem Leben der alten Kirche</span>, p. 39 ff.; Zöckler, <span class="ital">u.s.</span>, pp. 191, 192; Wendt, <span class="ital">in loco</span>; M‘Giffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 67; Conybeare, “Essenes,” Hastings’ B.D.; Kaufmann, <span class="ital">Socialism and Communism</span>, p. 5 ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">47</span>. <span class="ital">praising God</span>] because their hearts were full of thankfulness for the knowledge of Jesus as His Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having favour with all the people</span>] As it was said of Christ, “the common people heard Him gladly” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-37.htm" title="David therefore himself calls him Lord; and from where is he then his son?

The first attack made on them is (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>) by the priests, the captain of the Temple and the Sadducees.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved</span>] The oldest MSS. agree in omitting <span class="ital">to the church</span>, and the literal rendering of the most authoritative text is, <span class="bld">And the Lord added day by day together such as were in the way of salvation</span>, i.e. brought into the communion “such as” (literally) “were being saved,” the work of whose salvation was begun but needed perseverance; who had set foot on the way and were heirs through hope of ultimate salvation.

The rendering of the A. V. would require the verb to be in the future, whereas it is the present participle. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>. Salvation is a thing of the present, as well as of the past and future. The verb is used in all these senses in the New Testament. Thus, we were saved (not are, as A. V.), <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-24.htm">Romans 8:24</a>; shall or shalt be saved, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-9.htm">Romans 10:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>; ye are being saved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-2.htm">1 Corinthians 15:2</a>. "Godliness, righteousness, is life, is salvation. And it is hardly necessary to say that the divorce of morality and religion must be fostered and encouraged by failing to note this, and so laying the whole stress either on the past or on the future - on the first call, or on the final change. It is, therefore, important that the idea of salvation as a rescue from sin, through the knowledge of God in Christ, and therefore a progressive condition, a present state, should not be obscured, and we can but regret such a translation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-47.htm">Acts 2:47</a>, 'The Lord added to the church daily such as should be saved,' where the Greek implies a different idea" (Lightfoot, "On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament").<p>To the church<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-18.htm">Matthew 16:18</a>. </body></html>
