Here is an account of his death and sufferings, which they witnessed but a few weeks before. His death is considered as God's act; and of wonderful grace and wisdom. Thus Divine justice must be satisfied, God and man brought together again, and Christ himself glorified, according to an eternal counsel, which could not be altered. And as the people's act; in them it was an act of awful sin and folly. Christ's resurrection did away the reproach of his death; Peter speaks largely upon this. Christ was God's Holy One, sanctified and set apart to his service in the work of redemption. His death and sufferings should be, not to him only, but to all his, the entrance to a blessed life for evermore. This event had taken place as foretold, and the apostles were witnesses. Nor did the resurrection rest upon this alone; Christ had poured upon his disciples the miraculous gifts and Divine influences, of which they witnessed the effects. Through the Saviour, the ways of life are made known; and we are encouraged to expect God's presence, and his favour for evermore. All this springs from assured belief that Jesus is the Lord, and the anointed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore - Peter ascribes these expressions to the Messiah. The reason why he would exult or rejoice was, that he would be preserved amidst the sorrows that were coming on him, and could look forward to the triumph that awaited him. Thus, Paul says <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-2.htm">Hebrews 12:2</a> that "Jesus ..."for the joy that was set before him," endured the cross, despising the shame," etc. Throughout the New Testament, the shame and sorrow of his sufferings were regarded as connected with his glory and his triumph, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-26.htm">Luke 24:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-21</a>. In this our Saviour has left us an example that we should walk in his steps. The prospect of future glory and triumph should sustain us amidst all afflictions, and make us ready, like him, to lie down in even the corruptions of the grave.<p>Did my heart rejoice - In the Hebrew this is in the prescott tense, "my heart rejoices." The word "heart" here expresses "the person," and is the same as saying "I rejoice." The Hebrews used the different members to express the person. And thus we say, "every soul perished; the vessel had 40 hands; wise heads do not think so; hearts of steel will not flinch," etc. (Prof. Stuart on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/16-1.htm">Psalm 16:1-11</a>). The meaning is, because God is near me in time of calamity, and will support and deliver me, I will not be agitated or fear, but will exult in the prospect of the future, in view of the "joy that is set before me."<p>My tongue was glad - Hebrew, My glory or my honor exults. The word is used to denote "majesty, splendor, dignity, honor." It is also used to express the heart or soul, either because that is the chief source of man's dignity, or because the word is also expressive of the liver, regarded by the Hebrews as the seat of the affections, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-6.htm">Genesis 49:6</a>, "Unto their assembly, mine honor," that is, my soul, or myself, "be not thou united"; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/57-8.htm">Psalm 57:8</a>, "Awake up, my glory," etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/108-1.htm">Psalm 108:1</a>, "I will sing ...even with my glory." This word the Septuagint translated "tongue." The Arabic and Latin Vulgate have also done the same. Why they thus use the word is not clear. It may be because the tongue, or the gift of speech, was what chiefly contributes to the honor of man, or distinguishes him from the brutal creation. The word "glory" is used expressly for "tongue" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/30-12.htm">Psalm 30:12</a>; "To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be silent."<p>Moreover also - Truly; in addition to this.<p>My flesh - My body. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-31.htm">Acts 2:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. It means here properly the body separate from the soul; the dead body.<p>Shall rest - Shall rest or repose in the grave, free from corruption.<p>In hope - In confident expectation of a resurrection. The Hebrew word rather expresses confidence than hope. The passage means, "My body will I commit to the grave, with a confident expectation of the future, that is, with a firm belief that it will not see corruption, but will be raised up." It thus expresses the feelings of the dying Messiah; the assured confidence which he had that his repose in the grave would not be long, and would certainly come to an end. The death of Christians is also in the New Testament represented as a sleep, and as repose <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm">Acts 7:60</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-4.htm">2 Peter 3:4</a>; and they may also, after the example of their Lord, commit their bodies to the dust, in hope. They will lie in the grave under the assurance of a happy resurrection; and though their bodies, unlike his, will moulder to their native dust, yet this corruptible will put on incorruption, and this mortal will put on immorality, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-53.htm">1 Corinthians 15:53</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. was not possible he should be holden of it&#8212;Glorious saying!
