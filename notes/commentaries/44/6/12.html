And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yet the servant of the Lord, possessing a clear conscience, cheerful hope, and Divine consolations, may smile in the midst of danger and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they stirred up the people - They "excited" the people, or alarmed their fears, as had been done before when they sought to put the Lord Jesus to death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-20.htm">Matthew 27:20</a>.<p>The elders - The members of the Sanhedrin, or Great Council.<p>Scribes - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>.<p>To the council - To the Sanhedrin, or the Great Council of the nation, which claimed jurisdiction in the matters of religion.

The assertion of these <span class="greekheb">ὑποβλητοί</span> (Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell.</span> v. 10. 4; Plut. <span class="ital">Tib. Gr.</span> 8) served to direct the public opinion against Stephen; but a legal process was requisite for his complete overthrow, and prudence required the consent of the people. Therefore they stirred up the people and the elders of the people and the scribes, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συνεκίνησαν</span>] they drew them into the movement with them, stirred up them also. Often in Plut., Polyb., etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπιστάντες</span>] as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-1.htm" title="And as they spoke to the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came on them,">Acts 4:1</a>.

Now, namely, in presence of the Sanhedrim, it concerned them to bear witness to the blasphemy alleged to have been heard according to the real state of the facts, and in doing so those <span class="greekheb">ἄνδρες ὑποβλητοί</span> dealt as <span class="ital">false witnesses</span>. As formerly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-61.htm" title="And said, This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.">Matthew 26:61</a>) a saying of <span class="ital">Jesus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-19.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.">John 2:19</a>) was falsified in order to make Him appear as a rebel against the theocracy; so here also some expression of Stephen now unknown to us,—wherein the latter probably had pointed, and that in the spirit of Jesus Himself, to the reformatory influence of Christianity leading to the dissolution of the temple-worship and legal institutions, and the consummation of it by the Parousia, and had indeed, perhaps, quoted the prophecy of the Lord concerning the destruction of Jerusalem,—was so perverted, that Stephen now appears as herald of a revolution to be accomplished by Jesus, directed against the temple and against the law and the institutions of Moses.[187] Against the view of Krause (<span class="ital">Comment. in histor. atque orat. Steph.</span>, Gott. 1780), that an expression of <span class="ital">other</span>, more inconsiderate Christians was imputed to Stephen, may be urged not only the utter arbitrariness of such a supposition, but also the analogy of the procedure against Jesus, which very naturally presented itself to the enemies of Stephen as a precedent. Heinrichs (after Heumann and Morus) thinks that the <span class="greekheb">μάρτυρες</span> were in so far <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΨΕΝΔΕῖς</span></span></span>, as they had uttered an expression of Stephen <span class="ital">with an evil design</span>, in order to destroy him; so also Sepp, p. 17. But in that case they would not have been <span class="ital">false</span>, but only <span class="ital">malicious</span> witnesses; not a <span class="greekheb">ψεῦδος</span>, but a bad motive would have been predominant. Baur also and Zeller maintain the essential correctness of the assertion, and consequently the incorrectness of the narrative, in so far as it speaks of <span class="ital">false</span> witnesses. But an antagonism to the law, such as is ascribed by the latter to Stephen, would lack all internal basis and presupposition in the case of a believing Israelite full of wisdom and of the Holy Spirit (comp. Baumgarten, p. 125); as regards its true amount, it can only be conceived as analogous to the subsequent procedure of Paul, which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-13.htm" title="Saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.">Acts 18:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>, was misrepresented with similar perversity; nor does the defensive address, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/7-44.htm" title="Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking to Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen....">Acts 7:44-53</a>, lead further. Nevertheless, Rauch in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1857, p. 356, has maintained that Stephen actually made the assertion adduced by the witnesses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>, and that these were only <span class="ital">false</span> witnesses, in so far as they had not <span class="ital">themselves heard</span> this expression from the mouth of Stephen, which yet was the purport of their statement. This is at variance with the entire design and representation (see particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-11.htm" title="Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and against God.">Acts 6:11</a>). And the utterance itself, as the witnesses professed to have heard it, would, at any rate, even if used as a veil for a higher meaning, be framed after a manner so alien to Israelite piety and so unwise, that it could not be attributed at all to Stephen, full as he was of the Spirit. Oecumenius has correctly stated the matter: <span class="greekheb">ἐπειδὴ ἄλλως μὲν ἤκουσαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἄλλως δὲ νῦν αὐτοὶ προυχώρουν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰκότως καὶ ψευδομάρτυρες ἀναγράΦονται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ τόπου τοῦ ἁγίου</span>] the <span class="ital">holy</span> place <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἐξοχήν</span> is <span class="ital">the temple</span>, 3Ma 2:14.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm" title="For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.">Acts 6:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ναζωρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span>] is not to be considered as part of the utterance of Stephen, but as proceeding from the standpoint of the false witnesses who so designate Jesus <span class="ital">contemptuously</span>, and blended by them with the words of Stephen. And not only is <span class="greekheb">ὁ Ναζωρ</span>. an expression of <span class="ital">contempt</span>, but also <span class="greekheb">οὗτος</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-40.htm" title="Saying to Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.">Acts 7:40</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-26.htm" title="Moreover you see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away much people, saying that they be no gods, which are made with hands:">Acts 19:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-30.htm" title="But as soon as this your son was come, which has devoured your living with harlots, you have killed for him the fatted calf.">Luke 15:30</a>; Ast, <span class="ital">Lex.

Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> p. 148. But that Stephen, as Renss thinks (in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encykl.</span> XV. p. 73), preached something which the apostles had not previously taught, is all the more uncertain an assumption, seeing that already in the sayings of Jesus Himself sufficient materials for the purpose were given. Comp. <span class="ital">e.g.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Woman, believe me, the hour comes, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem, worship the Father.">John 4:21</a> ff., the sayings of Jesus concerning the Sabbath, concerning the Levitical purifications, concerning the <span class="greekheb">πλήρωσις</span> of the law, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, and the Parousia, etc. But Stephen (<span class="greekheb">ὁ τῷ πνεύματι ζέων</span>, <span class="ital">Constitt. ap.</span> viii. 46. 9) may have expressed himself in a more threatening and incisive manner than others, and thereby have directed the persecution to <span class="ital">himself</span>.
