In the Gospels it is ascribed to our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-54.htm" title="And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, From where has this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?">Matthew 13:54</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-40.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was on him.">Luke 2:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-52.htm" title="And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and man.">Luke 2:52</a>); and we read of “the wisdom of Solomon” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-42.htm" title="The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.">Matthew 12:42</a>). In a writer like St. Luke, it implies something higher even than the “consolation” or “prophecy” from which Barnabas took his name—wider thoughts, a clearer vision of the truth, the development of what had been before latent in hints and parables and dark sayings. The speech that follows in the next chapter, may be accepted as an example, as far as circumstances allowed, of the method and power of his general teaching.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-15 When they could not answer Stephen's arguments as a disputant, they prosecuted him as a criminal, and brought false witnesses against him. And it is next to a miracle of providence, that no greater number of religious persons have been murdered in the world, by the way of perjury and pretence of law, when so many thousands hate them, who make no conscience of false oaths. Wisdom and holiness make a man's face to shine, yet will not secure men from being treated badly. What shall we say of man, a rational being, yet attempting to uphold a religious system by false witness and murder! And this has been done in numberless instances. But the blame rests not so much upon the understanding, as upon the heart of a fallen creature, which is deceitful above all things and desperately wicked. Yet the servant of the Lord, possessing a clear conscience, cheerful hope, and Divine consolations, may smile in the midst of danger and death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To resist - That is, they were not able to "answer" his arguments.<p>The wisdom - This properly refers to his knowledge of the Scriptures; his skill in what "the Jews" esteemed to be wisdom - acquaintance with their sacred writings, opinions, etc.<p>And the spirit - This has been commonly understood of the Holy Spirit, by which he was aided; but it rather means the "energy, power," or "ardor" of Stephen. He "evinced" a spirit of zeal and sincerity which they could not withstand; which served, more than mere argument could have done, to convince them that he was right. The evidence of sincerity, honesty, and zeal in a public speaker will often go further to convince the great mass of mankind, than the most able argument if delivered in a cold and indifferent manner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which he spake&#8212;What he said, and the power with which he spake it, were alike resistless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Not able to resist; </span> they did oppose it, but ineffectually. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The wisdom: The foolishness of God is wiser than men, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-25.htm" title="Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.">1 Corinthians 1:25</a></span>.
