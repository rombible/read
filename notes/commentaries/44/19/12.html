We ask how St. Luke, passing over two years of labour in a few words, came to dwell so fully on these special facts. The answer may be found (1) in St. Luke’s own habit of mind as a physician, which would lead him to dwell on the various phenomena presented by the supernatural gift of healing; (2) a further explanation may be found in the inference suggested in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>. Such a report of special and extraordinary phenomena was likely enough to be made by a physician like Tyrannus to one of the same calling, and probably of the same faith. The picture suggested is that of devout persons coming to the Apostle as he laboured at his craft, and carrying away with them the very handkerchiefs and aprons that he had used, as precious relics that conveyed the supernatural gift of healing which he exercised. The efficacy of such <span class= "ital">media</span> stands obviously on the same footing as that of the hem of our Lord’s garment (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:">Matthew 9:20-21</a>), and the shadow of Peter (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>), and, we may add, of the clay in the healing of the blind (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>). The two conditions of the supernatural work of healing were a Divine Power on the one hand, and Faith on the other, and any external medium might serve to strengthen the latter and bring it into contact with the former. Cures more or less analogous, ascribed to the relics of saints, admit, in some measure, of a like explanation. Without pretending to draw a sharp line of demarcation between the natural and supernatural in such cases, it is clear that a strong belief in the possibility of a healing work as likely, or certain, to be accompanied by any special agent, does much to stimulate the activity of the <span class= "ital">vis medicatrix Naturæ</span> which before was passive and inert. It is not unreasonable to see in the works of healing so wrought a special adaptation to the antecedent habits of mind of a population like that of Ephesus. It was something for them to learn that the prayer of faith and the handkerchief that had touched the Apostle’s skin had a greater power to heal than the charms in which they had previously trusted.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-12 When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief and blasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholy company.

An instance somewhat similar to this occurs in the case of the woman who was healed by touching the hem of the Saviour's garment, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-20.htm">Matthew 9:20-22</a>.Unto the sick - The sick who were at a distance, and who were unable to go where he was. If it be asked why this was done, it may be observed:<p>(1) That the working of miracles in that region would greatly contribute to the spread of the gospel.<p>(2) we are not to suppose that there was any efficacy in the aprons thus brought, or in the mere fact that they had touched the body of Paul, anymore than there was in the hem of the Saviour's garment which the woman touched, or in the clay which he made use of to open the eyes of the blind man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-6.htm">John 8:6</a>.<p>(3) in this instance, the fact that the miracles were performed in this manner by garments which had touched his body, was a mere sign, or an evidence to the persons concerned, that it was done by the instrumentality of Paul, as the fact that the Saviour put his fingers into the ears of a deaf man, and spit and touched his tongue <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-33.htm">Mark 7:33</a>, was an evidence to those who saw it that the power of healing came from him. The bearing of these aprons to the sick was, therefore, merely evidence to all concerned that miraculous power was given to Paul.<p>Handkerchiefs - The word used here &#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  soudaria is of Latin origin, and properly denotes "a piece of linen" with which sweat was wiped from the face; and then "any piece of linen used for tying up or containing anything." In <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-20.htm">Luke 19:20</a>, it denotes the "napkin" in which the talent of the unprofitable servant was concealed; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-44.htm">John 11:44</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-7.htm">John 20:7</a>, the "napkin" which was used to bind up the face of the dead applied to Lazarus and to our Saviour.<p>Or aprons - &#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  simikinthia. This is also Latin word, and means literally a half girdle, or covering half the person a piece of cloth which was girded round the waist to preserve the clothes of those who were engaged in any kind of work. The word "aprons" expresses the idea.<p>And the diseases departed - The sick were healed.<p>And the evil spirits - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>. It is evident that this power of working miracles would contribute greatly to Paul's success among the people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The <span class="greekheb">τε</span> seems to indicate that this was the case (Weiss, Wendt); Blass on the other hand holds that it is not said that the demons were driven out by the <span class="ital">sudaria</span>. According to some interpretations of the verse the carrying of the aprons to the sick is only to be regarded as a result of the wonderful impression made by St. Paul’s miraculous power; the writer says nothing of the effect of these aprons, although he places both the healing of the diseases and the expulsion of the demons amongst the <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span> of St. Paul. From this point of view the carrying of the <span class="greekheb">σουδάρια</span> would only illustrate the superstitious practices which showed how often, in the homes of culture, quackery was also found, and the Evangelist gives them no word of commendation, see also note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-15.htm" title="And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?">Acts 19:15</a>. On the other hand we must remember that the miracles are distinctly spoken of as <span class="greekheb">οὐ τὰς τυχ</span>., and even in the means employed we may perhaps see a possible appeal to the populace, who would recognise that these charms and amulets in which they put such confidence had not the same potency as the handkerchiefs and aprons of the Apostle. But in this accommodation to special forms of ignorance we are never allowed to forget that God is the source of all power and might.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">so that from his body were brought unto the sick</span>] In the oldest MSS. the verb signifies “to be carried away from.” The <span class="ital">Rev. Version</span> brings out the meaning fully, and in a verse like this it is well to keep, as much as may be, the Greek order of the words. Read “Insomuch that unto the sick were carried away from his body.” St Luke is careful to intimate that the Apostle did not of himself adopt or recommend these methods, but the faith of the converts was such that it manifested itself in this way, and God was pleased to bestow blessings because of their faith. In the city of Ephesus where, as we find from this chapter, exorcism and “curious arts” of witchcraft and incantation were familiarly exercised, God appears to have made the cures that were wrought to be specially evidences of the power of faith. Paul does not go to the sick, and even the sons of Sceva (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches.">Acts 19:13</a>) recognise that it is not to Paul, but to Jesus whom he preacheth, that the “powers” are to be ascribed. Thus was God’s minister made to differ from the pretenders to miraculous power with which the Ephesian people were familiar. A specimen of these may be seen in the life of Apollonius of Tyana, iv. 3 (<span class="ital">Kayser</span>, p. 66).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">handkerchiefs or aprons</span>] Some take the latter word to signify the cincture, by which the loose robes of the Orientals were gathered together round the waist. This would be expressed by “belts” or “girdles.” Others think they were the aprons used by the Apostle while working at his trade. The derivation of the word favours the latter sense. They seem to have been employed to cover the front half of the dress during work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them</span>] The oldest texts omit the last two words. These converts acted on the popular belief, that virtue proceeded from the bodies of our Lord and His Apostles. St Luke notices this belief in his Gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-44.htm" title="Came behind him, and touched the border of his garment: and immediately her issue of blood stanched.">Luke 8:44</a>) and St Mark says of Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-30.htm" title="And Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that virtue had gone out of him, turned him about in the press, and said, Who touched my clothes?">Mark 5:30</a>) “perceiving in himself that the power proceeding from him had gone forth.” The words of Scripture can hardly be made to countenance, though they recognise, the popular belief. Yet, even though these men employed means which were unnecessary and superstitious to display their faith, because of the reality of this faith God did not suffer it to lose its reward.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χρωτὸς</span>, <span class="ital">from his body</span>) <span class="greekheb">χρὼς</span>, <span class="ital">the skin, the outermost part of the body</span>.
