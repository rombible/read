The noun is that which was technically used by physicians for the healing “powers” or “virtues” of this or that remedy, and is so far, though used freely by other writers, characteristic of St. Luke.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:...">Acts 19:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">And God </span>— To add the greater efficacy and success to this important doctrine; <span class="ital">wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul — </span>Who, as he abode longer at Ephesus than at any other city we read of, so he wrought more and greater miracles than in any other. <span class="ital">So that from his</span> <span class="ital">body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs, or aprons </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">σουδαρια η σιμικινθια</span>, <span class="ital">sudaria vel semicinctia. </span>These two words, originally Latin, have been differently rendered, but the etymology of the first plainly determines it to signify pieces of linen with which they wiped the sweat from their faces, and the latter word signifies things round their waists, doubtless girdles or sashes. Aprons made no part of the ordinary dress of the Greeks; yet they might possibly be occasionally used, both by men and women, to preserve their clothes clean, while they were engaged in some particular kind of work. Dr. Macknight thinks, that these handkerchiefs and aprons belonged to the sick, from whom they were brought to touch Paul’s body, and then taken back to them, when they had the effect here mentioned. <span class="ital">And the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits </span>— Which occasioned many of these diseases, though they might appear purely natural; <span class="ital">went out of them </span>— In this respect Paul was equal to Peter, whose shadow, as he passed by, overshadowing the sick, who were laid on couches in the streets of Jerusalem, cured them of their distempers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>. Hence we may infer, that it was in a great measure owing to the multitude and greatness of Paul’s miracles, that so many of the inhabitants of Ephesus, and of the province of Asia, embraced the gospel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-12 When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief and blasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholy company.

Luke, who also here (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-40.htm" title="Now when the sun was setting, all they that had any sick with divers diseases brought them to him; and he laid his hands on every one of them, and healed them.">Luke 4:40</a> f. <span class="ital">al</span>.) distinguishes the ordinary sick from the possessed, represents the healing of the former and the deliverance of the latter as an effect, which was brought about by the cloths laid on them; for <span class="greekheb">ὥστε</span> down to <span class="greekheb">ἐκπορ</span>. forms <span class="ital">together</span> the description of a peculiar kind of those unusual miraculous <span class="greekheb">δυνάμεις</span>. Purely <span class="ital">historical criticism</span>, independent of arbitrary premisses laid down à <span class="ital">priori</span>, has nothing to assail in this view, as the healing power of the apostle, analogous to the miraculous power of Jesus, might through his will be transmitted by means of cloths requested from him to the suffering person, and received by means of the faith of the latter. The truth of the occurrence stands on the same footing with the N.T. miraculous cures in general, which took place through the will of the worker of miracles, partly <span class="ital">with</span> and partly <span class="ital">without</span> sensible transmission. By relegating the matter from the historical domain of miracles, which is yet undoubtedly to be recognised in the working of Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>), to the sphere of legends as to relics (Baur, Zeller), with comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-15.htm" title="So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid them on beds and couches, that at the least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.">Acts 5:15</a>, or to that “of the servants’ rooms and houses behind” (Hausrath), the narrative of our passage is easily dismissed, but not got rid of, although a more special embellishment of it by the <span class="ital">importunity</span> of those seeking help, and by <span class="ital">the pouring out of the sweat</span> of the apostle as he worked (Baumgarten), of which the text indicates nothing, is to be set aside.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-11.htm" title="And God worked special miracles by the hands of Paul:">Acts 19:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ τὰς τυχ</span>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-2.htm" title="And the barbarous people showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.">Acts 28:2</a>, the phrase is peculiar to St. Luke, “not the ordinary,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, extraordinary, with which the deeds of the Jewish exorcists could not be compared, see Klostermann, <span class="ital">Vindiciæ Lucanæ</span>, p. 52, for the same phrase <span class="ital">cf.</span> 3Ma 3:7, and also Deissmann, <span class="ital">Neue Bibelstudien</span>, p. 83; so too in classical Greek.—<span class="greekheb">ἐποίει</span>: “continued to work,” or <span class="ital">ex more</span>, Blass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">And God wrought special miracles</span> [Gr. powers] <span class="ital">by the hands of Paul</span>] The language of the historian is noteworthy.

The imperfect tense of the verb in the Greek implies that these manifestations of God’s power were continued during the Apostle’s stay. This was no mere spasmodic excitement over some powerful discourse. “By the hands” is probably only the Jewish mode of expressing “by.” See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-12.htm" title="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.">Acts 5:12</a>.<a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Special (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>A peculiar expression.
