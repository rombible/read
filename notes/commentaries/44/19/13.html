(See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:">Acts 8:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-6.htm" title="And when they had gone through the isle to Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name was Barjesus:">Acts 13:6</a>.) They practised exorcisms as a profession, and went from city to city, pretending with charms and spells to cure those who were looked on as possessed with demons. Many of these were said to have come down from Solomon. In Layard’s <span class= "ital">Nineveh and Babylon</span> (c. 22) there is an interesting account of several bronze bowls containing such formulæ. To them “the name of the Lord Jesus,” which was so often in St. Paul’s lips, was just another formula, mightier than the name of the Most High God, or that of the archangels Raphael or Michael, which were used by others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-13.htm" title="Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists, took on them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the LORD Jesus, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches....">Acts 19:13-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then certain of the vagabond Jews, exorcists </span>— Dr. Whitby, and several other critics, have produced many passages from Irenæus, Origen, Epiphanius, and Josephus, to prove that several of the Jews, about this time, pretended to a power of casting out devils, particularly by some arts or charms derived from Solomon. These men are called <span class="ital">vagabond Jews, </span>and <span class="ital">exorcists, </span>because they strolled through the countries of the Lesser Asia, practising that magic which was in such vogue among the heathen. But when they came to Ephesus, hearing of the wonderful things which Paul performed in the name of Jesus, and, perhaps, seeing some of them, they <span class="ital">took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits, the name of the Lord Jesus </span>— Vain undertaking! Satan laughs at all those who attempt to expel him, either out of the bodies or souls of men, except by divine faith. <span class="ital">Saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth </span>— They do not say whom we believe in, or depend upon, or have authority from; but <span class="ital">whom Paul preacheth </span>— As if they had said, We will try what that name will do. The exorcists in the Roman Church, who pretend to cast the devil out of melancholy people, by spells and charms which they understand not, and for which they have not any divine warrant, and, therefore, cannot use them in faith, are the followers of these vagabond Jews. <span class="ital">There were seven sons of one Sceva </span>— A Jewish chief priest, who did this, desirous of the honour or profit which they thought would redound from such cures, and imagining there was some secret charm in the name of Jesus, to which these infernal agents would submit. <span class="ital">But the evil spirit </span>— Contemning their adjuration; <span class="ital">answered, Jesus I know, and Paul I know </span>— I know the authority and power of Jesus and Paul, and am ready to obey them; <span class="ital">but who are ye? </span>— What power have you to command us in his name? Or, who gave you any such power? <span class="ital">And the man, in whom the evil spirit was, leaped, </span>or <span class="ital">sprung, on them, and overcame them </span>— To such a degree, as to tear off their clothes from their backs, and beat them with great violence; <span class="ital">so that they fled out of </span>the <span class="ital">house</span> — In which they had attempted the cure; <span class="ital">naked and wounded </span>— And became public spectacles of scorn and derision, in a city where these things were peculiarly regarded. This is written for a warning to all those who name the name of Christ, but do not depart from iniquity. The same enemy, that overcomes them with his temptations, will overcome them with his terrors, and their adjuring him in Christ’s name to let them alone, will be no security to them. If we resist the devil by a true and lively faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by the bare using of Christ’s name, or any part of his word, as a spell or charm, or by merely professing his religion, he will prevail against us.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:13-20 It was common, especially among the Jews, for persons to profess or to try to cast out evil spirits. If we resist the devil by faith in Christ, he will flee from us; but if we think to resist him by the using of Christ's name, or his works, as a spell or charm, Satan will prevail against us. Where there is true sorrow for sin, there will be free confession of sin to God in every prayer and to man whom we have offended, when the case requires it. Surely if the word of God prevailed among us, many lewd, infidel, and wicked books would be burned by their possessors. Will not these Ephesian converts rise up in judgement against professors, who traffic in such works for the sake of gain, or allow themselves to possess them? If we desire to be in earnest in the great work of salvation, every pursuit and enjoyment must be given up which hinders the effect of the gospel upon the mind, or loosens its hold upon the heart.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The vagabond Jews - Greek: Jews going about -  &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  perierchomeno&#772;n. The word "vagabond" with us is now commonly used in a bad sense, to denote "a vagrant; a man who has no home; an idle, worthless fellow." The word, however, properly means "one wandering from place to place, without any settled habitation, from whatever cause it may be." Here it denotes "those Jews who wandered from place to place, practicing exorcism."<p>Exorcists - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;  exorkisto&#772;n.

It was applied in this sense, because those who pretended to be able to expel demons used the formula of an oath, or adjured them, to compel them to leave the possessed persons. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>. They commonly used the name of God, or called on the demons in the name of God to leave the person. Here they used the name Jesus to command them to come out. Such wanderers and pretenders are common in Oriental countries now.

That this art was practiced then, or attempted, is abundantly proved from Irenaeus, Origen, and Josephus (Antiq., book 8, chapter 2, section 5). See Doddridge.

Some think, that though there is certainly no power in the words and syllables which they pronounced, yet that the true God, being rather willing to be known and owned by those names, than that any should call on the names of the false gods, did sometimes put forth his power in casting out of devils at such times, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm" title="And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.">Matthew 12:27</a></span>.

These were certain Jews who went about from place to place, professing by charms and spells to cure diseases. The A.V. “vagabond” conveys in modern language a moral censure, which probably these men well deserved, but which is not in the Greek. The <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> has adopted <span class="bld">strolling</span>, which gives the sense of the original. We read in Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. viii. 2, 5) that “God gave Solomon skill against demons for the help and cure of men. And he arranged certain incantations whereby diseases are assuaged, and left behind him forms of <span class="ital">exorcism</span>, wherewith they so put to flight the overpowered evil spirits that they never return. And this method of curing is very prevalent among us up to the present time.” The Jews at Ephesus were professors of this pretended art of healing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">took upon them to call</span> [Better, <span class="bld">to name</span>] <span class="ital">over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus</span>] From an early date the traditional literature of the Jews ascribed great effects to the utterance of the incommunicable divine name. By means of this (they say) it was that Moses slew the Egyptian, and Elisha brought destruction on the mocking children “by the name of Jehovah.” We can understand therefore, if the fame of St Paul were become known, and the name of Jesus connected with his preaching and with the powers vouchsafed, how these men would make a pretence to the possession of the same secrets by which, as they would declare, the cures were wrought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preacheth</span>] The oldest texts give the singular, <span class="bld">I adjure</span>, and this no doubt is correct, for the words would be uttered only by the one person, who was performing the act of exorcism.

The expulsion of Satan from demoniacs is only an adumbration of the expulsion of Satan in ordinary cases from the hearts of all men. But even as he here mocked at those who attempt to effect the expulsion from demoniacs by a mere literal invocation of the name of Jesus without faith: so he derided, and in the present day laughs at, those who have attempted by works to deliver themselves from his power, ex. gr. priests and monks, etc.; for he then first began to have dominion over them, and to treat them altogether as he pleased.

The words should be construed together, "<span class="accented">strolling</span> Jewish exorcists." That certain Jews in our Savior's time exorcised evil spirits appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm">Matthew 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-49.htm">Luke 9:49</a>. We learn also from Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 8:2, 5, that forms of exorcism, said to have been invented by King Solomon, so efficacious that the devils cast out by them could never come back, were used with great effect in his days. He adds that he himself knew of an instance in which one of his own countrymen, Eleazar by name, had cast out devils in the presence of Vespasian and his <span class="accented">sons</span> and officers and a number of his soldiers. The method used was this: The exorcist applied to the nose of the possessed the bezil of a ring, under which was a certain root prescribed by Solomon, and so drew out the evil spirit through the man's nostrils. The possessed then fell to the ground, and the exorcist commanded the evil spirit in the name of Solomon never to return, and then recited one of Solomon's incantations. To give full assurance to the bystanders that the evil spirit had really left the man, the exorcist placed a vessel full of water at some distance off, and then commanded the ejected spirit to overturn it, which he did.
