Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if we inquire - If you seek to determine any other matters than that pertaining to the alleged wrong which Demetrius has suffered in his business.<p>Other matters - Anything respecting public affairs; anything pertaining to the government and the worship of Diana.<p>In a lawful assembly - In an assembly convened, not by tumult and riot, but in conformity to law. This was a tumultuous assemblage, and it was proper in the public officer to demand that they should disperse; and that, if there were any public grievances to be remedied, it should be done in an assembly properly convened. It may be remarked here that the original word rendered assembly is what is usually in the New Testament rendered church - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ekkle&#772;sia. It is properly rendered by the word "assembly" - not denoting here "a mixed or tumultuous assemblage, but one called out, or convened in the legal manner." The proper meaning of the word is "what is called out." "The church, the Christian assembly &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  ekkle&#772;sia of the faithful," is made up of those who are called out from the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. if ye inquire&#8212;"have any question."<p>concerning other matters&#8212;of a public nature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Other matters; </span> relating to the good government of the city, or maintaining the established religion, which ought not in such a confused manner to be treated of, but in an assembly called by lawful authority, which the Romans did usually call, at least, three times every month. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters,....

Mr. Wood, <span class="ital">Ephesus, App.</span>, p. 38, quotes an inscription in which it was enjoined that a statue of Minerva should be placed in a certain spot, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ πᾶσαν ἔννομον ἐκκλησίαν</span>. But A.V. has “the lawful assembly”: which is the better rendering? “regular” seems to restrict us to <span class="greekheb">νόμιμοι ἐκκλησίαι</span> held on stated customary days, and to exclude from the secretary’s statement any reference to extraordinary meetings, meetings summoned for special business, whereas he would be likely to use a term which would cover all legal meetings. But on the other hand Blass quotes the phrase given above from the inscriptions, and explains <span class="greekheb">ἔννομοι ἐκκλησίαι</span> <span class="ital">sunt, quæ ex lege certis diebus fiebant</span> (so too Wendt, Lightfoot); and if this is correct, “regular” would be the more appropriate rendering, <span class="greekheb">ἔννομος</span> = <span class="greekheb">νόμιμος</span>. But in Ephesus we have to consider how far the old Greek assembly <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span> was or was not under the control of the imperial government. In considering this with reference to the special incident before us, Ramsay, with whom Wendt agrees, p. 321 (1899), gives good reason for regarding the “regular” as equivalent to the “lawful” assemblies: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, extraordinary assemblies which in the Greek period had been legal, but were now so no longer through the jealous desire of Rome to control popular assemblies, abroad as at home. The <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span> could not be summoned without the leave of the Roman officials, and it was not at all likely that that sanction would be extended beyond a certain fixed and regular number, Ramsay, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, February, 1896: “The Lawful Assembly,” and “Ephesus,” Hastings’ B.D., p. 723.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">39</span>. <span class="ital">But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters</span>] <span class="ital">Rev.

If the matter were of such a character as to come before the proconsul, there he was, ready to hear the cause.

Of course the court where the proconsul sat was a “lawful assembly,” though the contrary might be inferred from A.V. The word rendered “lawful” signifies “appointed by law.” The days and time of the meeting of the city courts were defined by law. Thus the <span class="ital">Rev.
