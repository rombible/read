Ephesus, probably, came to be the centre of St. Paul’s activity, from which journeys were made to neighbouring cities; and hence we may legitimately think of the other six churches of Revelation 2, 3 as owing their origin to him. The growth of the new community among both sections of the population became a conspicuous fact, and began to tell upon the number of pilgrims who brought their offerings to the shrine of Artemis, or carried away memorials from it.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-12 When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief and blasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholy company.

See on [2056]Ac 20:31. But during some part of this period he must have paid a second unrecorded visit to Corinth, since the one next recorded (see on [2057]Ac 20:2, 3) is twice called his third visit (2Co 12:14; 13:1). See on [2058]2Co 1:15, 16, which might seem inconsistent with this. The passage across was quite a short one (see on [2059]Ac 18:19)&#8212;Towards the close of this long stay at Ephesus, as we learn from 1Co 16:8, he wrote his First Epistle to the Corinthians; also (though on this opinions are divided) the Epistle to the Galatians. (See [2060]Introduction to First Corinthians, and [2061]Introduction to Galatians). And just as at Corinth his greatest success was after his withdrawal to a separate place of meeting (Ac 18:7-10), so at Ephesus.<p>so that all they which dwelt in&#8212;the Roman province of<p>Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks&#8212;This is the "great door and effectual opened unto him" while resident at Ephesus (1Co 16:9), which induced him to make it his headquarters for so long a period. The unwearied and varied character of his labors here are best seen in his own subsequent address to the elders of Ephesus (Ac 20:17, &c.). And thus Ephesus became the "ecclesiastical center for the entire region, as indeed it remained for a very long period" [Baumgarten]. Churches arose at Colosse, Laodicea, and Hierapolis eastward, either through his own labors or those of his faithful helpers whom he sent out in different directions, Epaphras, Archippus, Philemon (Col 1:7; 4:12-17; Phm 23).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All they; </span> many of all sorts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Asia; </span> Asia the Lesser, or Asia strictly so called, lying about Ephesus: the heathens came thither to worship their Diana; the Jews came thither about their affairs, either in their trades, or law suits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The word of the Lord Jesus; </span> the gospel, which is the word concerning the Lord Jesus; or, the word which he appointed to be preached and published. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And this continued by the space of two years,....

D., i., 720. Nor must we suppose that St. Paul and his fellow-workers confined themselves literally to Ephesus. The seven Churches of Asia may reasonably be referred for their foundation to this period—all of which were centres of trade, and all within reach of Ephesus. Timothy, moreover, may well have been working at Colosse, since in the Epistle to the Colossians he is mentioned with Paul in the inscription of the letter, although the latter had not been personally known to the Churches of Colosse and Laodicea, Ramsay, “Colossæ,” Hastings’ B.D., and <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 274.—<span class="greekheb">Ἕλληνας</span>: comprising no doubt Hellenists and Greeks, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">And this continued by the space of two years</span>] The <span class="ital">Rev.

Speaking to the Ephesian elders at Miletus the Apostle says he ceased not to admonish the church there for “<span class="ital">three</span> years.” The two statements need not be conflicting. To the two years mentioned here when the three months of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm" title="And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.">Acts 19:8</a> are added, and the time which may have preceded his teaching in the synagogue (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-8.htm" title="And he went into the synagogue, and spoke boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.">Acts 19:8</a>), the duration of the Apostle’s stay in Ephesus would be described in Jewish reckoning as “three years,” which in their mode of speech need only consist of one whole year, and parts of that which preceded, and that which followed it. Cp. The reckoning of <span class="ital">three</span> days between the crucifixion and the resurrection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so that all they which dwelt in Asia heard</span>, &c.] The oldest authorities omit “Jesus” from this clause. By Asia is meant “proconsular Asia” (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-10.htm" title="Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes,">Acts 2:10</a>). The seed of the seven churches of the Apocalypse was sown in these two years. It is evident from the tumult described in this chapter that the Christian teaching was making as much way among the Gentiles as among the Jews. The language of St Luke here implies that the audience of St Paul was made up not of the settled inhabitants of Ephesus only, but of those who visited the city for business or pleasure, and carried news of the preacher and his message to all corners of the district. Philemon from Colossæ may have been one of St Paul’s converts during this time.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> <span class="accented">- For</span> for <span class="accented">by</span>, A.V.; Lord for <span class="accented">Lord</span> Jesus, A.V. and T.R. <span class="cmt_word">Two years</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm">Acts 20:31</a>, note). <span class="cmt_word">Both Jews and Greeks</span>.
