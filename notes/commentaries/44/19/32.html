Aristarchus or Gaius, who travelled to Jerusalem with St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-4.htm" title="The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or of men?">Luke 20:4</a>), and were with him also at Rome, may have told him the whole tale of the scene in which they had borne so prominent a part. Possibly, also, following up the hint thrown out in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>, we may think of Tyrannus as having written a report of the tumult to St. Luke. The two conjunctions translated “therefore” (better, <span class= "ital">then</span>) seem to carry the narrative back to what was passing in the theatre, after the parenthetical account of what had been going on between the Apostle, the disciples, and the Asiarchs outside it.<p><span class= "bld">For the assembly was confused.</span>—It is not without interest to note that the Greek word for assembly is the <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>with which we are so familiar as applied to the Church of Christ. Strictly speaking, as the town-clerk is careful to point out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-39.htm" title="But if you inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.">Acts 19:39</a>), this mob gathering was not an <span class= "ital">ecclesia, </span>but the word had come to be used vaguely.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Some therefore cried one thing ... - This is an admirable description of a mob, assembled for what purpose they knew not; but agitated by passions, and strifes, and tumults.<p>And the more part knew not ... - The greater part did not know.

These were wealthy and distinguished citizens of the principal towns of the Asian province, chosen annually, and ten of whom were selected by the proconsul to preside over the games celebrated in the month of May (the same month which Romanism dedicates to the Virgin). It was an office of the highest honor and greatly coveted. Certain of these, it seems, were favorably inclined to the Gospel, at least were Paul's "friends," and knowing the passions of a mob, excited during the festivals, "sent (a message) to him desiring him not to adventure himself into the theater."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> An excellent description of a popular tumult.

Alexander, otherwise entirely unknown, was certainly a <span class="ital">Christian</span>, since only to such a one is the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογεῖσθαι</span> suitable, not a Jew (Beza, Grotius, Ewald, and others). He is commonly, but arbitrarily, especially considering the frequency of the name, considered as identical with the Alexander mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1 Timothy 1:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>, in which case it is in its turn presupposed that the name occurring at those two passages denotes one person. Such completely indemonstrable assumptions cannot serve to prove the genuineness and time of the composition of the Epistles to Timothy (in opposition to Otto). The Alexander in our passage had, in the Christian interest, mixed among the crowd, and was pushed forward by the malicious Jews that he might make a public address and, if possible, become a sacrifice to the fury of the multitude. If we hold him to be a non-Christian Jew (which does not result from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-34.htm" title="But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is Diana of the Ephesians.">Acts 19:34</a>), it is to be supposed that the Jews would be afraid that, on this occasion, they also might be attacked, and therefore pushed forward Alexander, an eloquent man and hostile to Paul, that he might maintain the innocence of the Jews to the destruction of the Christians. But Luke must have called attention to <span class="ital">such</span> a connection,[102] and that the more as the simple <span class="greekheb">ἀπολογεῖσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to make a defence</span>, points quite naturally to the accusation of the <span class="ital">Christians</span> referred to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατασ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">χ</span>.] <span class="ital">moving his hand</span> up and down[103] (for a sign that he wished to speak).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῷ δημῷ</span>] <span class="ital">before the people</span>, Herod. vii. 161; Plat. <span class="ital">Prot</span>. p. 359 A; Lucian. <span class="ital">Gall.</span> 3.
