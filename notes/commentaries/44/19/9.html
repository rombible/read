Originally meaning “leisure,” it was applied to leisure as bestowed on study, then, as here, to the place in which study was pursued; lastly, as in our phrase, “the school of Zeno or Epicurus,” as a collective term for the followers of a conspicuous teacher. In this case, it was probably a lecture-room which, as the private property of the owner, was lent or let to the Apostle.<p>Of the Tyrannus here mentioned nothing more is known with certainty, but the name is connected with one or two interesting coincidences that are more or less suggestive. Like its Latin equivalent, R<span class= "ital">ex</span> it was not uncommon among the class of slaves or freed-men. It is found in the <span class= "ital">Columbarium</span> of the household of Livia on the Appian Way, and as belonging to one who is described as a <span class= "ital">Medicus</span> or physician. Both names and professions in this class were very commonly hereditary, and the hypothesis that this Tyrannus was also a physician, and that, as such, he may have known St. Luke, or, possibly, may have been among the Jews whom the decree of Claudius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>) had driven from Rome, and so shared the faith of Aquila and Priscilla, fits in with and explains the facts recorded. An unconverted teacher of philosophy or rhetoric was not likely to have lent his class-room to a preacher of the new faith. (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-12.htm" title="So that from his body were brought to the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.">Acts 19:12</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:8-12 When arguments and persuasions only harden men in unbelief and blasphemy, we must separate ourselves and others from such unholy company.

It is probable that he was a Jew, who was engaged in this employment, and who might not be unfavorably disposed toward Christians. In his school, or in the room which he occupied for teaching, Paul instructed the people when he was driven from the synagogue.

And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made his defense to the people.">Acts 19:33</a>, where the Jews attempt to put forward a spokesman in the tumult, that they wished the heathen populace to understand that Paul was not approved of by his own nationality.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he departed from them</span>] i.e. ceased to take part in the public services at the synagogue.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and separated the disciples</span>] The Christian part of the congregation, with any of the Jews who were more interested than the rest in his teaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">disputing</span> [Better, <span class="bld">reasoning</span>] <span class="ital">daily</span>] The verb is the same as in the previous verse. Among these more sympathizing hearers, he would only have to set forward the arguments for the faith which he preached unto them. His teaching now could go on constantly, and was not confined to the synagogue times of service.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the school of one Tyrannus</span>] The best authorities omit “one.” The teacher, whether a heathen or a Jew, was a man well known. Otherwise we can conceive no reason for the mention of a proper name. As the name is Greek, some have thought that the place meant was the lecture-room of a philosophic teacher; others, thinking that St Paul would hardly have chosen such a place for his preaching, have preferred to consider it a Jewish school or <span class="ital">Beth-Hammidrash</span>, in which his Jewish hearers would be more willing to assemble. Since the listeners are described, in the next verse, as being partly Jews, and partly Greeks, it is impossible to arrive at a conclusion. No doubt the Jews in Ephesus were numerous enough to render such “schools” necessary for their education, and in their intercourse with Gentiles they not unfrequently adopted a Gentile name in addition to their Jewish one. So Tyrannus may have been a Jew.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὡς</span>—<span class="greekheb">πλήθους</span>, <span class="ital">when</span>—before the <span class="ital">multitude</span>) A cause for just separation is public revilings against the truth.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποστὰς</span>, <span class="ital">having withdrawn</span>) He left their synagogue to them, content with a smaller school, and a more select number: <span class="greekheb">ἀποστὰς ἀφώρισε</span>, <span class="ital">having withdrawn he separated</span>: by his act he influenced other good men; [and so he secured them against the stumbling-block thrown in their way by the evil-speakers.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἡμέραν</span>, <span class="ital">daily</span>) not merely on the Sabbath or Lord’s day.—<span class="greekheb">σχολῇ</span>, <span class="ital">the school</span>) instead of the synagogue.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Some</span> for <span class="accented">divers</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">disobedient</span> for <span class="accented">believed not</span>, A.V.

"<span class="accented">Beth-midrash - The</span> Jewish divinity school, where their doctors disputed of the more high and difficult matters of the Law" (Index to Lightfoot's Works). It was commonly the upper room in the house of a rabbi (Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-13.htm">Acts 2:13</a>, vol. 8:363), whence "house of rabbis "was synonymous with <span class="accented">beth-midrash</span>, house of discussion. The name Tyrannus occurs in 2 Macc. 4:40; Josephus, 'Ant. Jud.,' 16. 10:4; 'Bell Jud.,' 1. 26:6, of an officer in Herod's bodyguard, who might be a Jew or a Greek; and a certain <span class="accented">Tyrannus</span> is described by Suidas as a sophist and an author, possibly the same as is here spoken cf. Lightfoot, Meyer, Alford, and others think that the Tyrannus here spoken of was a Jew; Lange, Olshausen, Howson, Farrar, Lewin, etc., think he was a Greek philosopher or rhetorician. Some think that "the school of Tyrannus" was the name of the lecture-room from some former teacher (see Renan. p. 345). </body></html>
