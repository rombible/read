He was the keeper of the records and archives of the city. The title appears in many of the inscriptions in Mr. Wood’s volume, often in conjunction with those of the Asiarchs and the proconsul. If, as is probable, his office was a permanent one, he was likely to have more weight with the people than the Asiarchs, who were elected only for a year, and who were not all of Ephesus. The language of the public officer is as characteristic in its grave caution as that of Demetrius had been in its brutal frankness. He, like the Asiarchs, obviously looks on St. Paul and his companions with respect. He has no feeling of fanaticism, and would not willingly be a persecutor. He dares not oppose the multitude, but he will try and soothe them with the loud profession of his attachment to the religion of his country. He was, if we may so speak, the Gamaliel of Ephesus, not without parallels among the princes and statesmen and prelates who have lived in the critical times of political and religious changes, and have endeavoured to hold the balance between contending parties.<p><span class= "bld">A worshipper of the great goddess Diana.</span>—The substantive as well as the adjective belonged to the local vocabulary. Its literal meaning is “temple sweeper,” or “sacristan”—one consecrated to the service of the goddess. The Greek word (<span class= "ital">neôkoros</span>) is found on coins and inscriptions of Ephesus as applied to the inhabitants, sometimes in relation to the Emperor, sometimes to the goddess. They looked to her as their guardian and protector. One inscription claims for the city the honour of being the “nurse” of the great goddess (Boeckh. 2954, <span class= "ital">ut supra</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> She was, as it were, to borrow a phraseology which presents only too painful an analogy, “Our Lady of Ephesus.” It is a curious fact that the same month was consecrated to Flora in Rome, and is now the “Mois de Marie” in France and Italy. The omission of the word “goddess” in nearly all the best MSS. is significant. She was, even without that word, emphatically “Artemis the Great” In some of the inscriptions of Ephesus she is described as “the greatest,” the “most High.”<p><span class= "bld">The image which fell down from Jupiter.</span>—The name was often given to old pre-historic images—as, <span class= "ital">e.g., </span>to that of Athenè Polias at Athens. It may have been merely a legendary way of stating that no one knew what artist had sculptured the image, or when it had been first worshipped. Possibly, however, the word may have had a more literal meaning as applied to a meteoric stone which had been employed by the sculptor, or was worshipped in its original form. The many-breasted image of Aitemis described in the Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm" title="For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain to the craftsmen;">Acts 19:24</a> is, however, reported to have been made of olive-wood. The word <span class= "ital">image</span> is not in the Greek, and one familiar word (<span class= "ital">diopetes</span>) was sufficient to express what requires seven in the English paraphrase.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-35.htm" title="And when the town cleark had appeased the people, he said, You men of Ephesus, what man is there that knows not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?...">Acts 19:35-41</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when the town-clerk </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ο γραμματευς</span>, <span class="ital">the scribe; </span>probably the proconsul’s secretary, to whom the direction of the affairs of the city was committed; <span class="ital">had appeased the people </span>— So far as to produce a degree of silence, the rioters, by their violent outcries so long continued, having spent their rage; <span class="ital">he said, What man is there </span>in the world, that has any intelligence of things at all, <span class="ital">that knoweth not that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">νεωκορον</span>, <span class="ital">the temple-keeper, of the great goddess Diana </span>— The expression is compounded of words which, taken together, signify to sweep or clean a temple, being used of a priest or priestess, or other person, whose business it was to look after the temple of any god or goddess, and see that it was not only kept in good repair, but also neat and clean, and beautified in a proper manner. This title was given also to those cities which had the care of the games celebrated in honour of any god or goddess. <span class="ital">And of the image which fell down from Jupiter — </span>They believed that very image of Diana, which stood in their temple, fell down from Jupiter in heaven. Perhaps this town-clerk, or secretary, designed to intimate that this image, as falling down from Jupiter, was not made with hands, and so was not of that sort of idols which Paul had said were no gods. <span class="ital">Seeing then these things cannot be </span>denied — But are plainly incontestable; <span class="ital">ye ought to be quiet </span>— Gentle in your proceedings; <span class="ital">and to do nothing rashly </span>— By which you may run yourselves into vast inconveniences and dangers before you are aware. In this speech, the secretary took hold of the multitude by their prejudices; for without speaking any thing concerning Paul’s doctrine, that images made with hands were no gods, he desired the Ephesians to consider that their privileges, as keepers of the temple of Diana, and of her heaven-descended image, were so universally acknowledged, that there was no danger of their losing that honour through any thing Paul had spoken. <span class="ital">For ye have</span> <span class="ital">brought these men, </span>Gaius and Aristarchus, <span class="ital">hither, which are neither robbers of churches </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ιεροσυλους</span>, <span class="ital">robbers of temples, </span>or sacrilegious persons; <span class="ital">nor yet blasphemers of your goddess </span>— The apostles had simply preached the one God, and the vanity of idols in general. The secretary further told them, that the men whom they had brought into the theatre were not yet proved to be guilty of those crimes which they appeared to lay to their charge; because, though they might have spoken against the images made by the craftsmen, they had said nothing against the image which Jupiter had given them: and added, that <span class="ital">if Demetrius and the craftsmen </span>had these, or any other crimes, to lay to their charge, of which they could prove them guilty, <span class="ital">there </span>were <span class="ital">deputies. </span>— Roman proconsuls, to whom they might apply, as the proper judges in such cases; and <span class="ital">the </span>courts of <span class="ital">law </span>were <span class="ital">open </span>— Where the matters might be fairly tried. <span class="ital">But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters </span>— If ye inquire whether the temple of Diana or her worship be in danger, or what persons or religions should be tolerated in the city, these are public matters, which should be <span class="ital">determined in a lawful assembly </span>— An assembly regularly appointed, and such as has authority to judge in religious and political affairs. <span class="ital">For we are in danger to be called in question </span>by the <span class="ital">Romans for this day’s uproar </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εγκαλεισθαι στασεως</span>, <span class="ital">to be accused of sedition; there being no cause </span>— No sufficient cause; <span class="ital">whereby we may give an account of </span>— May justify; <span class="ital">this concourse </span>— He wisely calls it by an inoffensive name. Fire, inundations, the sudden invasion of enemies, &c., might have excused a sudden concourse of people rushing together with some violence: but the secretary, with great propriety, observes that there was no such cause, nor any other adequate one, to be assigned in this instance. It must be observed, there was a Roman law which made it capital to raise a riot: <span class="ital">Qui cœtum et concursum fecerit capite puniatur. And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly </span>— And set Gaius and Aristarchus at liberty. The secretary’s conduct on this occasion shows that he had a good opinion of the Christian preachers. We may therefore believe, that in preaching against the established worship, Paul and his assistants had spoken nothing against Diana in particular, though their doctrine struck at all the heathen deities in the general: and even that in speaking against the established idolatry, they had used a becoming decency of language. The secretary, therefore, observing their prudence, entertained a good opinion of the cause they were engaged in. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when the town-clerk - &#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  ho grammateus.

It is, however, nowhere else applied to a pagan magistrate. It probably denoted "a recorder; or a transcriber of the laws; or a chancellor" (Kuinoel, Doddridge).

This is the language of strong confidence, of reproof, and of indignation. It implied that the worship of Diana was so well established that there was no danger that it could be destroyed by a few Jews, and he therefore reproved them for what he deemed their unreasonable fears. But he little knew the power of that religion which had been the innocent cause of all this tumult; nor that, at no very distant period, this despised religion would overturn not only the worship of Diana at Ephesus, but the splendid idolatry of the mighty Roman empire.<p>Is a worshipper - &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  neo&#772;koron. Margin, temple-keeper. The word used here does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It is derived from &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;  neo&#772;s, for &#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  naos, a temple, and &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;  koreo&#772;, to sweep, to cleanse. But among the ancients, the office of keeping their temples was by no means as humble as that of sexton is with us. It was regarded as an office of honor and dignity to have charge of the temples of the gods, and to keep them in order. The term was also given to the cities that were regarded as the special patrons or worshippers of certain gods and goddesses. They esteemed it an honor to be regarded as the special keepers of their temples and images, or as having adopted them as their tutelar divinities. Such was Ephesus in regard to Diana. It was considered to be a high honor that the city was everywhere regarded as being entrusted with the worship of Diana, or with keeping the temple regarded by the whole world as especially her own. See Schleusner on this word.<p>And of the image - A special guardian of the image, or statue of Diana.<p>Which fell down ... - Which was reigned or believed to have been sent down from heaven. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a>. It is probable that the image was so ancient that the maker of it was unknown, and it was therefore reigned to have fallen from heaven. It was for the interest of the priest to keep up this impression. Many cities pretended to have been favored in a similar manner with images or statues of the gods, sent directly from heaven. The safety of Troy was supposed to depend on the Palladium, or image of Pallas Minerva, which was believed to have fallen from heaven. Numa pretended that the ancilia, or sacred shields, had descended from heaven. Herodian expressly affirms that "the Phoenicians had no statue of the sun polished by the hand, but only a certain large stone, circular below, and terminated acutely above in the figure of a cone, of a black color, and that they believed it to have fallen from heaven." The same thing was affirmed of the ancient Minerva of the Athenian Acropolis (Paus., Att. 26); of the Paphian Venus, and the Ceres of Sicily (Cic. in Verr., v. 187). It has been supposed by some that this image at Ephesus was merely a conical or pyramidal stone which fell from the clouds - a meteorite - and that it was regarded with superstitious reverence, as having been sent from heaven.

Caused them to cease their loud outcry, so as that he could be heard. This person seems to have been more than a "town clerk", as we render it; or a common "scribe", as the Vulgate Latin, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions render it; rather as the Syriac version, "a chief man of the city"; the Septuagint interpreters in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-6.htm">Exodus 5:6</a> use the word for the Egyptian officers that were over the Israelites; and the Babylonians used to call the priest of (a) Isis by this name; and according to some learned men, this man's office was to register the conquerors' names, and their rewards in the theatre; and who was chosen into this office by the people, and was a man of some considerable authority, as it is very apparent by what follows that this man was: <p>he said, ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is a worshipper of the great goddess Diana? the word "Neocorus", translated "worshipper", signifies an officer in the temple, one that looked after it, beautified and adorned it; for "Neocorus" is from  which signifies to beautify (b); though some etymologists would have the word to signify to sweep and clean, as if this officer was a sexton; rather, he answered to a churchwarden, and to this agrees the Syriac version; though this office belonged not to a single person, but to a city. Now to be a worshipper of Diana, was not peculiar to the city of Ephesus, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-27.htm">Acts 19:27</a> but to be Neocorus, a sacrist to the goddess, was a favour granted to some cities, and accounted a great honour; some had it twice, some thrice, some four times: <p>and of the image which fell down from Jupiter; or "of Diopetes"; so the Palladium, or image of Pallas, was called, because it was supposed to fall down from heaven, which Diomedes and Ulysses are said to take away from Troy; and here it seems to be something distinct from the goddess Diana, and her image, and may design another deity worshipped along with her, and by them, since they make mention of more gods, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-26.htm">Acts 19:26</a>. The Vulgate Latin version takes it to be the same with Diana, reading the words in connection with the preceding, "and the offspring of Jupiter"; she being said to be his daughter by Latona, as before observed; and the Ethiopic version understands it of her image, rendering them thus, "and of that molten image which was sent from Jupiter the great god"; and more expressly the Syriac version, which reads, "and of her image which fell from heaven"; and so was not made with the hands of men, and could not be objected to on that account, or denied to be a deity; and this the people might be the rather induced to believe, since it had been in the temple before the memory of any man. The Arabic version, reading these words in connection with the beginning of the next verse, gives a very different sense, "but neither indeed they that fell from heaven contradict the faith of this thing"; as if it was to be understood of the fallen angels, of which it can hardly be thought Demetrius had any knowledge. This image, Pliny says (c), it was doubted of what it was made; some said of the vine tree, others of ebony; but Athenagoras says, the old image of Diana of the Ephesians was made of olive (d). <p>(a) Alex. ab Alex. l. 2. c. 8.

It would seem that the title at Ephesus was generally used in connection with the imperial <span class="ital">cultus;</span> in the period of this narrative, Ephesus could claim the title as Warden of one Temple of this <span class="ital">cultus</span>, and later on she enjoyed the title of <span class="greekheb">δὶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">τρὶς νεωκόρος</span>, as the number of the temples of the imperial <span class="ital">cultus</span> increased.

The worship of Diana of the Ephesians was entirely Asian and not Greek, although the Greek colonists attempted to establish an identification with their own Artemis on account of certain analogies between them. According to Jerome, <span class="ital">Præfat. ad Ephesios</span>, the Ephesian Artemis was represented as a figure with many breasts, <span class="ital">multimammia</span> (“quam Græci <span class="greekheb">πολύμαστον</span> vocant”), symbolising the reproductive and nutritive powers of Nature which she personified. This description is fully borne out by the common representations of the goddess on coins and statues. No one could say for certain of what the <span class="greekheb">ἄγαλμα</span> was made: according to Petronius it was made of cedar wood, according to Pliny of the wood of the vine, according to Xen. of gold, and according to others of ebony.

Through him all public communications were made to the city, and in his name replies were given.

The speech is full of ability, and shews that the man was fitted for his eminent position.

The Rev.

His office, as appears from the passage in Thucydides, was to read public documents to the people. According to some, it was not a post of much dignity at Athens (Becket, on Thucyd., 7:10); but according to Kuinoel it was an office of first-rate influence in the senate in the Greek cities of Asia, seeing the scribe was the chief registrar, had the drafting of the laws, and the custody of the archives.

The word <span class="accented">Neoceros</span> was a peculiar title, assumed first by persons and then by such cities, in Asia especially, as had the special charge of the temple and sacred rites of any particular god. It first appears on coins of Ephesus, in the reign of Nero, and was deemed a title of great honor.

Some extant coins exhibit the city of Ephesus as <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> both of Diana and the emperor (see Lewin, vol. 1. p. 411; Howson, vol. it. pp. 75, 76). <span class="cmt_word">The image which fell down from Jupiter</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c2;</span>, understand <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, as in the 'Iphig. in Taur.,' 947), <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>; which is described in ver. 88 of the same play as "the image (<span class="greek">&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>) of the goddess Diana, which they say fell down from heaven (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) into her temple in Tauris;" and in line 1349 it is called <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f50;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, "<span class="accented">The</span> image of the daughter of Jove which fell from heaven," brought away from Tauris by Iphigenia and Orestes into Attica. But it does not appear that there was any tradition that the identical image brought from Tauris was carried to Ephesus. There are several representations of the Ephesian Diana, or Artemis, on coins, of which one or two are given by Lewin (vol. 1. p, 411) and by Howson (vol. it. p. 66). The image was of rude form and execution, mummy-shaped, or like an inverted pyramid; <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;</span> (rendered by St. Jerome <span class="accented">multi-mammia</span>, and explained as intending to represent her as the nourisher of all living things: Preface to Ephesians); made of wood variously described as ebony, cedar, and vine wood.
