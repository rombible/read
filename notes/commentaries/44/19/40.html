The “called in question” is the same verb as that rendered “implead” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-38.htm" title="Why if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another.">Acts 19:38</a>. There was a risk of which Demetrius and his party had to be reminded, that they might find themselves defendants, and not plaintiffs, in a suit. A riotous “concourse” (the town-clerk uses the most contemptuous word he can find, “this <span class= "ital">mob meeting”</span>) taking the law into its own hands was not an offence which the proconsuls were likely to pass over lightly. It would hardly be thought a legitimate excuse that they had got hold of two Jews and wanted to “lynch” them.<p>An interesting inscription of the date of Trajan, from an aqueduct at Ephesus, gives nearly all the technical terms that occur in the town-clerk’s speech, and so far confirms the accuracy of St. Luke’s report: “This has been dedicated by the loyal and devoted Council of the Ephesians, and the people that serve the temple (<span class= "ital">Neôkoros</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>Peducæus Priscinus being <span class= "ital">proconsul, </span>by the decree of Tiberius Claudius Italicus, the <span class= "ital">town-clerk</span> of the people.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:32-41 The Jews came forward in this tumult. Those who are thus careful to distinguish themselves from the servants of Christ now, and are afraid of being taken for them, shall have their doom accordingly in the great day. One, having authority, at length stilled the noise. It is a very good rule at all times, both in private and public affairs, not to be hasty and rash in our motions, but to take time to consider; and always to keep our passions under check. We ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly; to do nothing in haste, of which we may repent at leisure. The regular methods of the law ought always to stop popular tumults, and in well-governed nations will do so. Most people stand in awe of men's judgments more than of the judgement of God. How well it were if we would thus quiet our disorderly appetites and passions, by considering the account we must shortly give to the Judge of heaven and earth! And see how the overruling providence of God keeps the public peace, by an unaccountable power over the spirits of men. Thus the world is kept in some order, and men are held back from devouring each other. We can scarcely look around but we see men act like Demetrius and the workmen. It is as safe to contend with wild beasts as with men enraged by party zeal and disappointed covetousness, who think that all arguments are answered, when they have shown that they grow rich by the practices which are opposed. Whatever side in religious disputes, or whatever name this spirit assumes, it is worldly, and should be discountenanced by all who regard truth and piety. And let us not be dismayed; the Lord on high is mightier than the noise of many waters; he can still the rage of the people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To be called in question - By the government; by the Roman authority. Such a tumult, continued for so long. a time, would be likely to attract the attention of the magistrates, and expose them to their displeasure. Popular commotions were justly dreaded by the Roman government; and such an assembly as this, convened without any good cause, would not escape their notice. There was a Roman law which made it capital for anyone to be engaged in promoting a riot.

But a further question arises from the marginal rendering of R.V., “to be accused of riot concerning this day”: so Page, Meyer-Wendt, Zöckler. But Blass, Weiss, Rendall, so Ram say: “to be accused of riot concerning this day’s assembly,” <span class="ital">sc.</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐκκλησία</span>, although Blass thinks it still better to omit <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῆς</span> altogether, and to connect <span class="greekheb">σήμερον</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐγκαλ</span>., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm" title="If we this day be examined of the good deed done to the weak man, by what means he is made whole;">Acts 4:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μηδενὸς αἰτίου ὑπάρχοντος</span>: with this punctuation R.V. renders “there being no cause <span class="ital">for it</span>,” taking <span class="greekheb">αἰτίου</span> as neuter, and closely connecting the phrase with the foregoing, so W. H. Overbeck (so Felten, Rendall) takes <span class="greekheb">αἰτίου</span> as masculine: “there being no man guilty by reason of whom,” etc., and Wendt considers that the rendering cannot be altogether excluded. Vulgate has “cum nullus obnoxius sit”. But <span class="greekheb">αἰτίου</span> may be strictly a noun neuter from <span class="greekheb">αἴτιον</span> = <span class="greekheb">αἰτία</span>, and not an adjective as the last-mentioned rendering demands, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Plummer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-4.htm" title="Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.">Luke 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-14.htm" title="Said to them, You have brought this man to me, as one that perverts the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man touching those things whereof you accuse him:">Luke 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-22.htm" title="And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil has he done?

The A. V. seems here to be incorrect. ‘The word for “uproar” ought not to be joined with “this day.” The construction is contrary to N. T. usage, and the adoption of it has caused some violence to be done to the other words. The verb rendered “called in question” is the verb used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-38.htm" title="Why if Demetrius, and the craftsmen which are with him, have a matter against any man, the law is open, and there are deputies: let them accuse one another.">Acts 19:38</a> in the sense of “accuse,” while the word for “uproar” means “riot,” “sedition.” So the <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> gives, as an alternative version, “For indeed we are in danger to be accused of riot concerning this day.” Of course the town-clerk did not want himself to call it <span class="ital">riot</span>, but he intimates to them that other people may do so. He only styles it a “<span class="ital">concourse</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse</span>] Here the readings of the oldest MSS. raise a considerable difficulty. Their repetition of <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> after <span class="greekheb">περὶ οὖ</span> gives another form to the sentence altogether. But it is not possible to decide with certainty whether the two letters in question should or should not be part of the text. Westcott and Hort place them in their text, but do not think that thus the reading is correct. The rendering of the Received Text is that of the A.V. The text with the additional <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> is translated in the <span class="ital">Rev. Ver.</span> “<span class="bld">there being no cause</span> for it: <span class="bld">and as touching it we shall not be able</span> <span class="ital">to give account of this concourse</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the alternative rendering of the <span class="ital">Rev.

But "<span class="accented">it"</span> must mean "the riot," which is feminine, whereas <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3cb;</span> is masculine; so that the R.T. is impossible to construe. It is much better, therefore, to adhere to the T.R., which has good manuscript authority, and to construe as the A.V. <span class="accented">Whereby</span>, equivalent to "<span class="accented">on</span> the ground of which" (Meyer). With regard to the great tumult to which the foregoing narrative relates, it is certain that St. Luke has by no means exaggerated its importance. In his Second Epistle to the Corinthians, written from Macedonia shortly after his departure from Ephesus, St. Paul speaks as one still smarting under the severity of his sufferings. In the language of trust, yet of a trust sorely tried, he speaks of the Father of mercies" who comforteth us in all our tribulation." He speaks of the sufferings of Christ as abounding in him. And then, referring directly to the trouble which came upon him in Asia, he <span class="accented">says</span>, "We were pressed out of measure, above strength, insomuch that we despaired even of life: but we had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raiseth the dead: who delivered us from so great a death" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm">2 Corinthians 1:4-10</a>). And the same tone breaks out again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-7.htm">2 Corinthians 4:7-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-4.htm">2 Corinthians 6:4-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm">2 Corinthians 11:23-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm">2 Corinthians 12:9, 10</a>. It is also very probable that it was on this occasion that Priscilla and Aquila saved St. Paul's life at the risk of their own, to which he alludes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3, 4</a>, written after he had reached Corinth from Macedonia, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> before Easter of the year  So that it is certain that the riot and the danger to St. Paul's life were even greater than we should have inferred from St. Luke's narrative alone. It should be added, with reference to the three <span class="accented">years</span> residence at Ephesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-21.htm">Acts 20:21</a>) which this nineteenth chapter describes, that one or two important incidents which occurred are not related by St. Luke. The first is that encounter with a savage rabble to which St. Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-32.htm">1 Corinthians 15:32</a>, but of which we have no account in the Acts. It must have happened in the early part of his sojourn at Ephesus. Another is a probable visit to Corinth, inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-14.htm">2 Corinthians 12:14, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-1.htm">2 Corinthians 13:1, 2</a>; and thought to have been caused by bad accounts of the moral state of the Corinthian Church, sent to him at Ephesus. It was probably a hasty visit, and in contrast with it he says, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-7.htm">1 Corinthians 16:7</a>, with reference to his then coming visit, "I will not see you now by the way; but I trust to tarry a while with you." It is also thought that there was another letter to the Corinthians, written from Ephesus, soon after that second visit, which is now lost, but is alluded to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. The First Epistle to the Corinthians was manifestly written at this time from Ephesus (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm">1 Corinthians 16:8, 19</a>). Some think that the Epistle to the Galatians was also written from Ephesus, a little before the First Epistle to the Corinthians (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>); but Renan thinks it was written from Antioch, before he came to Ephesus. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Concourse (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit., a twisting together: hence of anything which is rolled or twisted into a mass; and so of a mass of people, with an underlying idea of confusion: a mob.
