The tabernacles of Moloch, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>, which the Israelites carried about in the wilderness, seem to have been things of the same kind with Diana’s shrines. See Hammond and Whitby. These little temples, or shrines, were in great request, not only in Ephesus, but in other parts of Asia, as being curious and beautiful ornaments, and used for idolatrous purposes. And in this business, it appears, Demetrius employed a great number of workmen, much to their advantage as well as his own. But, perceiving there would be an end of the trade if Paul’s doctrine were suffered to spread, he <span class="ital">called together </span>— Those whom he employed; <span class="ital">with the workmen of like occupation </span>— Employed by others; and <span class="ital">said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft </span>— This manufacture of silver shrines; <span class="ital">we have our wealth </span>— Not only our subsistence, but riches, and, therefore, on no account must we suffer this craft to grow into contempt. It is natural for men to be jealous for that, whether right or wrong, by which they get their wealth: and many have, for this reason alone, set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men off from those employments which are unlawful, how much wealth soever is gotten by them. <span class="ital">Moreover, ye see and hear </span>— That is, ye see what is done in Ephesus, and ye have information of the state of things in other places; <span class="ital">that this Paul hath persuaded much people </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">ου μονον Εφεσου</span>, <span class="greekheb">αλλα σχεδον πασης της Ασιας</span>, <span class="ital">not only of Ephesus, but of all Asia; and turned </span>them <span class="ital">away </span>— From the established religion; <span class="ital">saying, that they be no gods which are made with hands </span>— And could any truth be more plain and self- evident than this affirmed by Paul? or any reasoning more cogent and convincing than that of the prophet, <span class="ital">The workmen made it, therefore it is</span> <span class="ital">not god? </span>The first and most genuine notion that we have of God is, that he has his being of himself, and depends upon none; but that all things have their being from him, and their dependance on him: from which it must follow, that those are no gods which are the creatures of men’s fancy, and the work of men’s hands; and yet, what is here said manifestly shows that the contrary opinion did in those ages generally prevail, namely, that there was a real divinity in the images of their supposed deities; though some of the latter heathen have spoken of them just as the Papists do now. <span class="ital">So that not only our craft is in danger to be set at naught </span>— To come into disgrace and be ruined, which must be the necessary consequence of Paul’s success; <span class="ital">but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised </span>— No wonder a discourse should make a deep impression, which was edged both by interest and superstition; <span class="ital">and her magnificence, </span>or majesty, <span class="ital">destroyed </span>— Miserable majesty, which was capable of being thus destroyed! <span class="ital">Whom all Asia and the world </span>— That is, the Roman empire; <span class="ital">worshippeth </span>— Although under a great variety of titles and characters, as the goddess of hunting, of travelling, child-birth, enchantments, &c.; as Luna, Hecate, Lucina, Proserpine, and so on. Under one or other of which views, she had, undoubtedly, a vast number of votaries. Her temple, raised at the expense of all Asia, was two hundred and twenty years in building, and was four hundred and twenty-five feet long, two hundred and twenty broad, and supported by one hundred and twenty-seven marble pillars, erected by so many kings. It was also adorned with many most beautiful statues, and was considered as one of the seven wonders of the world. It was burned down on the day on which Socrates was poisoned; then again on the night when Alexander the Great was born, by Erostratus, purely that he might be remembered in after ages; and destroyed the last time in the reign of Constantine, pursuant to the edict of that emperor, commanding all the heathen temples to be demolished.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:21-31 Persons who came from afar to pay their devotions at the temple of Ephesus, bought little silver shrines, or models of the temple, to carry home with them. See how craftsmen make advantage to themselves of people's superstition, and serve their worldly ends by it. Men are jealous for that by which they get their wealth; and many set themselves against the gospel of Christ, because it calls men from all unlawful crafts, however much wealth is to be gotten by them. There are persons who will stickle for what is most grossly absurd, unreasonable, and false; as this, that those are gods which are made with hands, if it has but worldly interest on its side. The whole city was full of confusion, the common and natural effect of zeal for false religion. Zeal for the honour of Christ, and love to the brethren, encourage zealous believers to venture into danger. Friends will often be raised up among those who are strangers to true religion, but have observed the honest and consistent behaviour of Christians.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No small stir - No little excitement, disturbance, or tumult &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  tarachos.
