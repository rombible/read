Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Men, brethren, and fathers - This defense was addressed to the Jews, and Paul commenced it with an expression of sincere respect for them. Stephen began his defense with the same form of address. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>.<p>My defence - Against the charges brought against me. Those charges were, that he had endeavored to prejudice people everywhere against the Jews, the Law, and the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-28.htm">Acts 21:28</a>. In order to meet this charge, Paul stated:<p>(1) That he was a Jew by birth, and had enjoyed all the advantages of a Jewish education, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-3.htm">Acts 22:3</a>;<p>(2) He recounted the circumstances of his conversion, and the reason why he believed that he was called to preach the gospel, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm">Acts 22:4-16</a>;<p>(3) He proceeded to state the reasons why he went among the Gentiles, and evidently intended to vindicate his conduct there, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm">Acts 22:17-21</a>; but at this point, at the name Gentiles, his defense was interrupted by the enraged multitude, and he was not permitted to proceed.<p>What would have been his defense, therefore, had he been suffered to finish it, it is impossible to know with certainty. On another occasion, however, he was permitted to make a similar defense, and perhaps to complete the train of thought which he had purposed to pursue here.

Thus e.g. the oration of Gorgias entitled, <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x1f75;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x2c;</span> begins, <span class="greek">&#x1f29;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f72;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. And Demosthenes opposes <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> to accuse, to <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, to make one's defense. And an <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;</span> is to prove that <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, "the things of which the person is accused," were never done. But it is probably from St. Paul's use of the word here that it became common to call the defenses of the Christian religion by the term <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. Thus we have the 'Apologies' of Justin Martyr, of Tertullian, of Minutius Felix, among the ancients; me 'Apologia Ecclesiae Anglicanae,' by Bishop Jewel, and many others. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Defence (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>See on answer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-15.htm">1 Peter 3:15</a>. </body></html>
