The Lord having chosen the sinner, that he should know his will, he is humbled, enlightened, and brought to the knowledge of Christ and his blessed gospel. Christ is here called that Just One; for he is Jesus Christ the righteous. Those whom God has chosen to know his will, must look to Jesus, for by him God has made known his good-will to us. The great gospel privilege, sealed to us by baptism, is the pardon of sins. Be baptized, and wash away thy sins; that is, receive the comfort of the pardon of thy sins in and through Jesus Christ, and lay hold on his righteousness for that purpose; and receive power against sin, for the mortifying of thy corruptions. Be baptized, and rest not in the sign, but make sure of the thing signified, the putting away of the filth of sin. The great gospel duty, to which by our baptism we are bound, is, to seek for the pardon of our sins in Christ's name, and in dependence on him and his righteousness. God appoints his labourers their day and their place, and it is fit they should follow his appointment, though it may cross their own will. Providence contrives better for us than we do for ourselves; we must refer ourselves to God's guidance. If Christ send any one, his Spirit shall go along with him, and give him to see the fruit of his labours. But nothing can reconcile man's heart to the gospel, except the special grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>.<p>I also was standing by - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm">Acts 7:58</a>.<p>And consenting unto his death - <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>.<p>And kept the raiment - The outer robes or garments, which were usually laid aside when they engaged in running or labor.

These circumstances are mentioned here by him as reasons why he knew that he would not be received by Christians as one of their number, and why it was necessary, therefore, for him to turn to the Gentile world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. get &#8230; quickly out of Jerusalem&#8212;compare Ac 9:29.<p>for they will not receive thy testimony &#8230; And I said, Lord, they know, &c.&#8212;"Can it be, Lord, that they will resist the testimony of one whom they knew so well as among the bitterest of all against Thy disciples, and whom nothing short of resistless evidence could have turned to Thee?"<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Martyr</span> is a Greek word, that signifies a witness; and is here, and since by the ecclesiastical writers, appropriated unto such as suffer death for the testimony they give to the truths of God, or doctrine of the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Consenting unto his death; </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm" title="And Saul was consenting to his death.

Stephen was a martyr for Christ, both by confession with his mouth, and by the effusion of his blood; he was the proto-martyr, or "the first martyr" that suffered for Christ; and there are copies, as one of Stephens's, and the Complutensian edition, which so read in this place; his blood was shed by stoning: <p>I also was standing by; to see the inhuman action performed; nor was he an idle and indifferent spectator: <p>and consenting unto his death; being pleased and delighted with it, and rejoicing at it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-1.htm">Acts 8:1</a>. <p>and kept the raiment of them that slew him; the accusers of him, and witnesses against him, whose hands were first on him, and cast the first stones at him, and continued to stone him, until they killed him: these laid their garments at the feet of Saul, who looked after them, that nobody stole them, and run away with them, whilst they were stoning Stephen; which shows how disposed he was to that fact, and how much he approved of it: and these things he mentions to suggest that surely the Jews would receive his testimony, since they knew what a bitter enemy he had been to this way: and therefore might conclude, that he must have some very good and strong reasons, which had prevailed upon him to embrace this religion against all his prejudices, and so might be willing to hear them; and it also shows what an affection the apostle had for the Jews, and how much he desired their spiritual welfare, for which reason he chose to have stayed, and preached among them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting unto his death, and kept the raiment of them that <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> slew him.</span><p>(b) This is properly spoken, for Steven was murdered by a bunch of cutthroats, not by order of justice, but by open force: for at that time the Jews could not put any man to death by law.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-20.htm" title="And when the blood of your martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting to his death, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.">Acts 22:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σου</span>: he identifies himself with Stephen, his testimony like that of the martyr is borne to Christ; on the word see p. 67; the term is here in a transition stage from “witness” to “martyr,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-6.htm" title="And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I wondered with great admiration.">Revelation 17:6</a> : Hackett quotes the Christians of Lyons, towards the close of the second century, refusing to be called “martyrs” because such an honourable name only belonged to the true and faithful Witness, or to those who had sealed their testimony by constancy to the end, and they feared lest they should waver: Euseb., <span class="ital">Hist.</span>, v., 2.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ αὐτὸς</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-13.htm" title="Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.">Acts 8:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-32.htm" title="And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brothers with many words, and confirmed them.">Acts 15:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-24.htm" title="Them take, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges with them, that they may shave their heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning you, are nothing; but that you yourself also walk orderly, and keep the law.">Acts 21:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/24-15.htm" title="And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust....">Acts 24:15-16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-22.htm" title="Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would also hear the man myself.
