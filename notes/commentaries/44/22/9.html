Paul relates the history of his early life very particularly; he notices that his conversion was wholly the act of God. Condemned sinners are struck blind by the power of darkness, and it is a lasting blindness, like that of the unbelieving Jews. Convinced sinners are struck blind as Paul was, not by darkness, but by light. They are for a time brought to be at a loss within themselves, but it is in order to their being enlightened. A simple relation of the Lord's dealings with us, in bringing us, from opposing, to profess and promote his gospel, when delivered in a right spirit and manner, will sometimes make more impression that laboured speeches, even though it amounts not to the full proof of the truth, such as was shown in the change wrought in the apostle.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm">Acts 9:3-7</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-6.htm">Acts 22:6</a><p>As I made my journey - As I was on my journey.<p>About noon - <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-13.htm">Acts 26:13</a>, "at mid-day."

This may be added to what was formerly said, that the men who travelled with Paul may be said not to have heard the voice of him that spake, because they did not understand it, or obey it; they were not converted, as Paul was, by it; the Hebrew language putting hearing for obeying, as in many scriptures; and both St. Paul, who here spake, and Luke, who penned this history, understood exactly the proprieties of that tongue. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they that were with me saw indeed the light,....

Ver.</span> But they are not like anything in the other two accounts, the one of which (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm" title="And the men which journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing a voice, but seeing no man.">Acts 9:7</a>) describes Saul’s companions as being “speechless,” the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-14.htm" title="And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me? it is hard for you to kick against the pricks.">Acts 26:14</a>) as “all falling to the ground.” Therefore it seems best to retain them, as not being due to any annotation, or to the assimilation of one form of the story to another. The last three letters of this phrase are the same as those of the phrase preceding it, and the eye of a scribe in early times may have passed from one to the other, and thus words belonging to the earliest form of the narrative may have been omitted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">heard not the voice</span>] i.e. the words which were spoken to Saul. They were only conscious of a sound around them. See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-7.htm" title="And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why persecute you me?">Acts 22:7</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> <span class="accented">- Beheld</span> for <span class="accented">saw</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Beheld indeed the light [and were afraid</span>, A.V.]. This corresponds with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, that the men who journeyed with Saul "stood speechless." They were dazzled and amazed at the sudden brightness. <span class="cmt_word">But they heard not the voice</span>. This at first sight seems inconsistent with the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>, "hearing the voice." But the apparent inconsistency disappears when we observe that here St. Paul wished to impress upon his hearers that, though his companions had seen the light, they had not heard the words which were addressed to him by the Lord Jesus (see ver. 14); whereas St. Luke, in the narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9.htm">Acts 9</a>, wished rather to insist upon the fact that though the men had seen the light and heard the sound of the voice, they had not seen Jesus. To see and hear the risen Christ was a privilege given to St. Paul alone. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/22.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Heard not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb is to be taken in the sense of understood, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-33.htm">Mark 4:33</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm">1 Corinthians 14:2</a>, which explains the apparent discrepancy with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-7.htm">Acts 9:7</a>. </body></html>
