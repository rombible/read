For the great success which Paul had in converting the idolatrous Gentiles, raised the envy and indignation of the unbelieving Jews to such a pitch, that, transported with a blind and furious zeal, they hired (<span class="greekheb">των αγοραιων τινας ανδρας πονηρους</span>) certain dissolute fellows who frequented the market-place, and were prepared to do any thing, however bad, for a small reward. These <span class="ital">gathered a company </span>— Collected a mob; and soon <span class="ital">set all the city in an uproar </span>— Threw it into the greatest confusion; and <span class="ital">assaulted the house of Jason </span>— Where Paul and his assistants lodged; <span class="ital">and sought to bring them out to the people </span>— Whom they had incensed and enraged against them, and by whom they hoped to see them pulled in pieces. <span class="ital">And when they found them not </span>— As they expected, in the house; (the apostles, it seems, having been advised to withdraw, as being most obnoxious;) <span class="ital">they drew Jason — </span>A converted Jew; <span class="ital">and certain brethren </span>— Who were with him; <span class="ital">unto the rulers </span>— To whom they represented them as very criminal, in having received and harboured dangerous persons, not fit to be tolerated, enemies to the public peace, who threw every thing into disorder wherever they came: <span class="ital">crying, These that have turned the world upside down — </span>With their new doctrine; <span class="ital">are come hither also </span>— To create the same disturbance among us; <span class="ital">whom Jason hath received </span>— Hath sheltered under his roof, and so hath made himself responsible for all the mischief they may do here; <span class="ital">and these all do contrary to the decrees of Cesar </span>— Not to any particular decree, for there was as yet no law of the empire against Christianity; but contrary to Cesar’s power in general to make decrees; <span class="ital">saying, that there is another king — </span>Not only a king of the Jews, as Christ was himself charged before Pilate with saying; but a universal Monarch, a <span class="ital">Lord of all, </span>as Peter called him in the first sermon he preached to the Gentiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-36.htm" title="The word which God sent to the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)">Acts 10:36</a>; for doubtless they alluded to the Christian doctrine concerning the Lordship, or universal dominion of Jesus, which they pretended was inconsistent with the universal lordship of Cesar. It is true, the Roman government, both while it was a commonwealth, and after it came into the hands of the Cesars, was very jealous of any governor under their dominion taking upon him the title of king, and there was an express law against it; but Christ’s kingdom was not of this world. His followers said, indeed, that Jesus was a king, but not an earthly king: not a rival with Cesar, nor one whose ordinances interfered with the decrees of Cesar; but who made it a law of his kingdom, <span class="ital">to render unto Cesar the things that were Cesar’s. </span>There was nothing in the doctrine of Christ that tended to the dethroning of princes, or the depriving of them of any of their prerogatives, as they knew very well; and it was against their consciences that they laid any thing of this kind to the charge of Christ’s disciples. And of all people, it ill became the Jews to do it, who hated Cesar and his government, and sought the ruin both of him and it; and who expected a Messiah that should be a temporal prince, and overturn <span class="ital">the thrones of kingdoms; </span>and were therefore opposing our Lord Jesus because he did not appear under that character. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-9 The drift and scope of Paul's preaching and arguing, was to prove that Jesus is the Christ. He must needs suffer for us, because he could not otherwise purchase our redemption for us; and he must needs have risen again, because he could not otherwise apply the redemption to us. We are to preach concerning Jesus that he is Christ; therefore we may hope to be saved by him, and are bound to be ruled by him. The unbelieving Jews were angry, because the apostles preached to the Gentiles, that they might be saved. How strange it is, that men should grudge others the privileges they will not themselves accept! Neither rulers nor people need be troubled at the increase of real Christians, even though turbulent spirits should make religion the pretext for evil designs. Of such let us beware, from such let us withdraw, that we may show a desire to act aright in society, while we claim our right to worship God according to our consciences.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moved with envy - That they made so many converts, and met with such success.<p>Certain lewd fellows of the baser sort - This is an unhappy translation. The word "lewd" is not in the original. The Greek is, "And having taken certain wicked people of those who were about the forum," or market-place. The forum, or market-place, was the place where the idle assembled, and where those were gathered together that wished to be employed, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-3.htm">Matthew 20:3</a>. Many of these would be of abandoned character, the idle, the dissipated, and the worthless, and, therefore, just the materials for a mob. It does not appear that they felt any particular interest in the subject; but they were, like other mobs, easily excited, and urged on to any acts of violence. The pretence on which the mob was excited was, that they had everywhere produced disturbance, and that they violated the laws of the Roman emperor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6-7</a>. It may be observed, however, that a mob usually regards very little the cause in which they are engaged. They may be roused either for or against religion, and become as full of zeal for the insulted honor of religion as against it. The profane, the worthless, and the abandoned thus often become violently enraged for the honor of religion, and full of indignation and tumult against those who are accused of violating public peace and order.<p>The house of Jason - Where Paul and Silas were, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm">Acts 17:7</a>.

The Alexandrian copy, the Vulgate Latin, and Syriac versions leave out the words, "which believed not"; but whether this character is expressed or not, it is certain that the unbelieving Jews are here intended: <p>moved with envy; at the success of the apostles, many of their own people and of their proselytes, and some of the better sort being converted by them: or "with zeal"; for what they called the glory of God, but it was not according to knowledge; it was a blind and ignorant zeal, a zeal for the rites and ceremonies of the law of Moses, and for the traditions of the elders: <p>took unto them certain lewd fellows of the baser sort; or of the market folks, who sat and sold things in the market, and were generally of the meaner and vulgar sort, as the word may signify; or who stood idle in the market place, squandering away their time in an idle manner, not caring to work, and so were fit persons, and who could easily be gathered together, for such service as the unbelieving Jews employed them in; or they were a sort of officers and servants, that attended courts of judicature, and cited persons thither, and assisted in the business done there, and who were commonly men of profligate and abandoned lives: <p>and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar; they raised a mob, and made a clamour, which brought people out of their houses to inquire what was the matter, and so gave great disturbance and uneasiness to the inhabitants: <p>and assaulted the house of Jason: who by what follows appears to have been a disciple of Christ, a believer in him, and the host of the apostle and his companions, who being an inhabitant of Thessalonica, at least having a dwelling house there, received them into it. This Jason is said to be one of the seventy disciples, and afterwards bishop of Tarsus, but this is not certain; nor whether he was a Jew or a Greek, very probably the former: we read of Jason the brother of Onias the high priest, a Jew, <p>"But after the death of Seleucus, when Antiochus, called Epiphanes, took the kingdom, Jason the brother of Onias laboured underhand to be high priest,'' (2 Maccabees 4:7) <p>whose name was Jesus, the same with Joshua, but as Josephus (i) says, he called himself Jason; and so this man's Hebrew name might be Jesus or Joshua, and his Greek name Jason; and very likely he was a believer in Christ before the apostle came to Thessalonica, and it may be is the same who is spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>.  See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>. Some of the ancients (k) make mention of a disputation between Jason, a Christian Hebrew, and Papiscus, an Alexandrian Jew, but there is no reason to believe that he is the Jason here spoken of: <p>and sought to bring them out to the people; they expected to have found Paul and Silas in Jason's house, where they lodged, and their intention was to have dragged them out and exposed them to popular fury, to be beaten or stoned by the people; and so the Arabic version reads, "requiring those two apostles, that they might set them before the people"; or put them into the hands of the mob, which they had gathered, to do as they would with them. <p>(i) Antiqu. l. 12. c. 5. sect. 1.((k) Origen. contr. celsum, 1. 4. p. 199.

We have no English word sufficiently dignified to use for such a term in translation. “Loafer” comes nearest, but of course is too colloquial. The word “lewd” meant in old English “people,” but afterwards came to signify (1) “the common people” and (2) “the ignorant and rude among the people,” which is the sense intended by the A. V. The word nearest akin to “lewd” is the Germ. <span class="ital">leute</span> = people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">set all the city on an uproar</span>] There is no word in the Greek for “all.” The Jews in Thessalonica must have been numerous and influential to bring about such a tumult, but they preferred to raise (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-7.htm" title="Whom Jason has received: and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.">Acts 17:7</a></span>) the cry that the new teachers were enemies of the Roman power.

If, as is very probable, the Jason here mentioned is the same person as the Jason of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-21.htm">Romans 16:21</a>, it would seem that he joined the apostle, either at this time or on his visit to Macedonia mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-3.htm">Acts 20:3</a>, and went with him to Corinth, where the Epistle to the Romans was written. He was a relation, <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, of St. Paul's, and doubtless a Jew. <span class="accented">Jason</span> was a Romanized form of the name <span class="accented">Jesus</span>, or <span class="accented">Joshua, as</span> we see in the case of the high priest, the brother of Chins (Josephus, ' Ant.

It was borne also by Jason of Cyrene, the Jewish historian (2 Macc. 2:23), and by another mentioned in 1 Macc. 7. 1:17, etc. St. Luke seems to introduce Jason as a well-known person. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/17.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Of the baser sort (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>From &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;, the market-place; hence loungers in the market-place; the rabble.
