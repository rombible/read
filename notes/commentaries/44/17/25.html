Men have to think of God as the supreme Giver, not as requiring anything at their hands but justice, mercy, and truth. Both Jewish and heathen writers had borne their witness of the same truth: David had said, “Thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm" title="For you desire not sacrifice; else would I give it: you delight not in burnt offering.">Psalm 51:16</a>), and the Latin Epicurean poet had written of the Divine nature, that it was—<p>“Ipsa suis pollens opibus, nihil indiga nostri,<p>Nec bene promeritis capitur, nec tangitur ira.”<p>[“Strong in itself, it needeth nought of ours,<p>Is neither won by gifts, nor moved by wrath.”]<p><span class= "ital">Lucret.</span> ii. 649-50.<p>The passage is found also in some editions in i. 61, 62.<p><span class= "bld">Life and breath.</span>—If we can draw a distinction between the two words, the first may be held to mean the higher element of man’s life, the latter that which he shares, by virtue of his organization, with other animals. Stoics and Epicureans would, probably, both of them, so far, accept a teaching which echoed much that was taught in their own schools.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither is worshipped with men's hands - The word here rendered "worshipped" (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  therapeuetai) denotes to "serve"; to wait upon; and then to render religious service or homage. There is reference here, undoubtedly, to a notion prevalent among the pagan, that the gods were fed or nourished by the offerings made to them. The idea is prevalent among the Hindus that the sacrifices which are made, and which are offered in the temples, are consumed by the gods themselves. Perhaps, also, Paul had reference to the fact that so many persons were employed in their temples in serving them with their hands; that is, in preparing sacrifices and feasts in their honor. Paul affirms that the great Creator of all things cannot be thus dependent on his creatures for happiness, and consequently, that that mode of worship must be highly absurd. The same idea occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-12</a>;<p>For every beast of the forest is mine;<p>And the cattle upon a thousand hills.<p>I know all the fowls of the mountain;<p>And the wild beasts of the field are mine.<p>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee;<p>For the world is mine, and the fulness thereof.<p>Seeing he giveth - Greek: he having given to all, etc.<p>Life - He is the source of life, and therefore he cannot be dependent on that life which he has himself imparted.<p>And breath - The power of breathing, by which life is sustained. He not only originally gave life, but he gives it at each moment; he gives the power of drawing each breath by which life is supported. It is possible that the phrase "life and breath may be the figure hendyades, by which one thing is expressed by two words. It is highly probable that Paul here had reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; "And the Lord God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." The same idea occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-10.htm">Job 12:10</a>;<p>In whose hand is the life (margin) of every living thing;<p>And the breath of all mankind.<p>And all things - All things necessary to sustain life. We may see here how dependent man is on God. There can be no more absolute dependence than that for every breath. How easy it would be for God to suspend our breathing! How incessant the care, how unceasing the providence, by which, whether we sleep or wake - whether we remember or forget him, he heaves our chest, fills our lungs, restores the vitality of our blood, and infuses vigor into our frame!
