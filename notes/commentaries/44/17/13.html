It is apparently with reference to this that St. Paul says of them that “they please not God and are contrary to all men, forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-15.htm" title="Who both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they please not God, and are contrary to all men:">1Thessalonians 2:15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:10-15 The Jews in Berea applied seriously to the study of the word preached unto them. They not only heard Paul preach on the sabbath, but daily searched the Scriptures, and compared what they read with the facts related to them. The doctrine of Christ does not fear inquiry; advocates for his cause desire no more than that people will fully and fairly examine whether things are so or not. Those are truly noble, and likely to be more and more so, who make the Scriptures their rule, and consult them accordingly. May all the hearers of the gospel become like those of Berea, receiving the word with readiness of mind, and searching the Scriptures daily, whether the things preached to them are so.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Stirred up the people - The word used here &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  saleuein denotes properly "to agitate" or "excite," as the waves of the sea are agitated by the wind. It is with great beauty used to denote the "agitation and excitement of a popular tumult," from its resemblance to the troubled waves of the ocean.
