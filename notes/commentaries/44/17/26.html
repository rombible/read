This gives his Philosophy of History. And the position was one which no Greek, above all, no Athenian, was likely to accept. For him the distinction between the Greek and the barbarian was radical and essential. The one was by nature meant to be the slave of the other. (Aristot. <span class= "ital">Pol.</span> i. 2, 6.) In rising above his own prejudices of fancied superiority of race, the Apostle felt that he could attack, as from a vantage-ground, the prejudices of others. He naturally accepted the truth as it was presented to him in the Mosaic history of the Creation; but the truth itself, stated in its fullest form, would remain, even if we were to accept other theories of the origin of species and the history of man. There is a oneness of physical structure, of conditions and modes of life, of possible or actual development, which forbids any one race or nation, Hebrew, Hellenic, Latin, or Teutonic, to assume for itself that it is the cream and flower of humanity.<p><span class= "bld">Hath determined the times before appointed.</span>—The better MSS. give simply, “the appointed seasons.” Few words, even in St. Paul’s teaching, are more pregnant with significance. They justify all that the wise of heart have said as to the “manifold wisdom of God,” as seen in history and in the education of mankind. The special gifts of character of each race—Hebrew thought of God, Greek sense of beauty, Roman sense of law, Teutonic truthfulness, Keltic impulsiveness,  docility—have all their work to do. All local circumstances of soil and climate that influence character come under the head of the “bounds of men’s habitation.” All conditions of time—the period at which each race has been called to play its part in the drama of the world’s history—come under the head of the “appointed seasons.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:22-31 Here we have a sermon to heathens, who worshipped false gods, and were without the true God in the world; and to them the scope of the discourse was different from what the apostle preached to the Jews. In the latter case, his business was to lead his hearers by prophecies and miracles to the knowledge of the Redeemer, and faith in him; in the former, it was to lead them, by the common works of providence, to know the Creator, and worship Him. The apostle spoke of an altar he had seen, with the inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. This fact is stated by many writers. After multiplying their idols to the utmost, some at Athens thought there was another god of whom they had no knowledge. And are there not many now called Christians, who are zealous in their devotions, yet the great object of their worship is to them an unknown God? Observe what glorious things Paul here says of that God whom he served, and would have them to serve. The Lord had long borne with idolatry, but the times of this ignorance were now ending, and by his servants he now commanded all men every where to repent of their idolatry. Each sect of the learned men would feel themselves powerfully affected by the apostle's discourse, which tended to show the emptiness or falsity of their doctrines.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And hath made of one blood - All the families of mankind are descended from one origin or stock. However different their complexion, features, or language, yet they are derived from a common parent. The word blood is often used to denote "race, stock, kindred." This passage affirms that all the human family are descended from the same ancestor; and that, consequently, all the variety of complexion, etc., is to be traced to some other cause than that they were originally different races created. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1.htm">Genesis 1</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm">Malachi 2:10</a>. The design of the apostle in this affirmation was probably to convince the Greeks that he regarded them all as brethren; that, although he was a Jew, yet he was not enslaved to any narrow notions or prejudices in reference to other people. It follows from the truth here stated that no one nation, and no individual, can claim any pre-eminence over others in virtue of birth or blood. All are in this respect equal; and the whole human family, however they may differ in complexion, customs, and laws, are to be regarded and treated as brethren. It follows, also, that no one part of the race has a right to enslave or oppress any other part, on account of difference of complexion. No one has a right because:<p>He finds his fellow guilty of a skin<p>Not colored like his own; and having power<p>T' enforce the wrong, for such a worthy cause to<p>Doom and devote him as his lawful prey.<p>For to dwell ... - To cultivate and until the earth. This was the original command <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>; and God, by his providence, has so ordered it that the descendants of one family have found their way to all lands, and have become adapted to the climate where he has placed them.<p>And hath determined - Greek: &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  horisas. Having fixed, or marked out a boundary. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>. The word is usually applied to a field. It means here that God "marked out," or "designated in his purpose," their future abodes.<p>The times before appointed - This evidently refers to the dispersion and migration of nations. And it means that God had, in his plan, fixed the times when each country should be settled, and the rise, the prosperity, and the fall of each nation. The different continents and islands have not, therefore, been settled by chance, but by a wise rule, and in accordance with God's arrangement and design.<p>And the bounds of their habitation - Their limits and boundaries as a people. By customs, laws, inclinations, and habits he has fixed the boundaries of their habitations, and disposed them to dwell there. We may learn:<p>(1) That the revolutions and changes of nations are under the direction of infinite wisdom;<p>(2) That people should not be restless and dissatisfied with the place where God has located them;<p>(3) That God has given sufficient limits to all, so that it is not needful to invade others; and,<p>(4) That wars of conquest are evil.<p>God has given to people their places of abode, and we have no right to disturb those abodes, or to attempt to displace them in a violent manner. This strain of remark by the apostle was also opposed to all the notions of the Epicurean philosophers, and yet so obviously true and just that they could not gainsay or resist it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27. and hath made of one blood all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth&#8212;Holding with the Old Testament teaching, that in the blood is the life (Ge 9:4; Le 17:11; De 12:23), the apostle sees this life stream of the whole human race to be one, flowing from one source [Baumgarten].<p>and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation&#8212;The apostle here opposes both Stoical Fate and Epicurean Chance, ascribing the periods and localities in which men and nations flourish to the sovereign will and prearrangements of a living God.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hath made of one blood:</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

That is, of one man's blood; the Vulgate Latin version reads, "of one"; and the Arabic version of De Dieu reads, "of one man"; of Adam, the first parent of all mankind, and who had the blood of all men in his veins: hence the Jews (u) say, <p>"the first man was  , "the blood of the world";'' <p>and this by propagation has been derived from him, and communicated to all mankind. They also say (w), that <p>"the reason why man was created alone (or there was but one man created) was, on account of families, that they might not be stirred up one against another;'' <p>that is, strive and contend with one another about pre-eminence: and they add, <p>"that the righteous might not say we are the sons of the righteous, and ye are the sons of the wicked.'' <p>And it is a certain truth that follows upon this, that no man has any reason to vaunt over another, and boast of his blood and family; and as little reason have any to have any dependence upon their being the children of believers, or to distinguish themselves from others, and reject them as the children of unbelievers, when all belong to one family, and are of one man's blood, whether Adam or Noah: of whom are <p>all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; for from Adam sprung a race of men, which multiplied on the face of the earth, and peopled the world before the flood; these being destroyed by the flood, and Noah and his family saved, his descendants were scattered all over the earth, and repeopled it: and this is the original of all the nations of men, and of all the inhabitants of the earth; and stands opposed to the fabulous accounts of the Heathens, which the apostle might have in his view, that men at first grew up out of the earth, or after the flood were formed of stones, which Deucalion and Prometheus threw over their heads; and particularly the Athenians boasted that they sprung out of the earth, which Diogenes ridiculed as common with mice and worms. But the apostle ascribes all to one blood: <p>and hath determined the times before appointed; how long the world he has made shall continue; and the several distinct periods, ages, and generations, in which such and such men should live, such and such nations should exist, and such monarchies should be in being, as the Assyrian, Persian, Grecian, and Roman, and how long they should subsist; as also the several seasons of the year, as seedtime and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night; and which are so bounded, and kept so distinct in their revolutions, as not to interfere with, and encroach upon each other; and likewise the several years, months, and days of every man's life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-1.htm">Job 7:1</a> to which may be added, the times of the law and Gospel; the time of Christ's birth and death; the time of the conversion of particular persons; and all their times of desertion, temptation, affliction, and comfort; the times of the church's sufferings, both under Rome Pagan and Rome Papal; of the holy city being trodden under foot, of the witnesses prophesying in sackcloth, and of their being killed, and their bodies lying unburied, and of their resurrection and ascension to heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm">Revelation 2:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-12.htm">Revelation 11:12</a> the time of antichrist's reign and ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-5.htm">Revelation 13:5</a> and of Christ's personal coming, and the day of judgment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-15.htm">1 Timothy 6:15</a> and of his reign on earth for a thousand years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-4.htm">Revelation 20:4</a>. All these are appointed times, and determined by the Creator and Governor of the world: <p>and the bounds of their habitation; where men shall dwell, and how long they shall continue there the age or distinct period of time, in which every man was, or is to come into the world, is fixed and determined by God; nor can, nor does anyone come into the world sooner or later than that time; and also the particular country, city, town, and spot of ground where he shall dwell; and the term of time how long he shall dwell there, and then remove to another place, or be removed by death. And to this agrees the Ethiopic version, which renders the whole thus, "and hath appointed his times, and his years, how long they shall dwell"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm">Deuteronomy 32:8</a> to which the apostle seems to refer. <p>(u) Caphtor, fol. 37. 2.((w) T.

When Renan and others speak of Christianity extending its hand to the philosophy of Greece in the beautiful theory which it proclaimed of the moral unity of the human race (<span class="ital">Saint Paul</span>, p. 197) it must not be forgotten that Rome and not Greece manifested the perfection of Pagan ethics, and that, even so, the sayings of a Seneca or an Epictetus wanted equally with those of a Zeno “a lifting power in human life”. The cosmopolitanism of a Seneca no less than that of a Zeno failed; the higher thoughts of good men of a citizenship, not of Ephesus or elsewhere, but of the world, which were stirring in the towns where St. Paul preached, all these failed, <span class="ital">Die Heraklitischen Briefe</span>, p. 91 (Bernays); it was not given to the Greek or to the Roman, but to the Jew, separated though he was from every other nation, to safeguard the truth of the unity of mankind, and to proclaim the realisation of that truth through the blood of a Crucified Jew (Alford).

St. Paul owed his doctrine of Providence to no school of philosophy, but to the sacred Scriptures of his nation, which had proclaimed by the mouth of lawgiver, patriarch, psalmist, and prophet alike, that the Most High had given to the nations their inheritance, that it was He Who had spread them abroad and brought them in, that it was His to change the times and the seasons, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-8.htm" title="When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 32:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-23.htm" title="He increases the nations, and destroys them: he enlarges the nations, and straitens them again.">Job 12:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-16.htm" title="The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth has he given to the children of men.">Psalm 115:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-21.htm" title="And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:">Daniel 2:21</a>, see further the note on <span class="greekheb">πρόνοια</span>, Wisdom of Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-3.htm" title="Long time therefore stayed they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony to the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.">Acts 14:3</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-2.htm" title="And Paul, as his manner was, went in to them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,">Acts 17:2</a>), <span class="ital">Speaker’s Commentary</span> (Farrar).—<span class="greekheb">τὰς ὁροθεσίας τῆς κατοικίας</span>: the first noun is not found elsewhere either in classical or biblical Greek, but <span class="ital">cf.</span> Blass, <span class="ital">Gram.</span>, p. 69. <span class="greekheb">κατοικία</span>: only here in N.T., but frequent in LXX; found also in Polyb., of a dwelling; so in Strabo, of a settlement, a colony.

Smith, <span class="ital">Historical Geography of the Holy Land</span>, pp. 112, 113, and 302, 303 ff.; Curtius, “Paulus in Athen.,” <span class="ital">Gesammelte Abhandlungen</span>, ii., 531, 536.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">and hath made of one blood</span>] All the best MSS. omit the word “blood.” And this seems to bring out more fully what the Apostle desires to dwell on; the Fatherhood of God. It is not that men are all of one family and so all equal in God’s eyes, and ought to be in the eyes of one another. But when we read “they are made of One” we are carried back to the higher thought of the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-10.htm" title="Have we not all one father? has not one God created us? why do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by profaning the covenant of our fathers?">Malachi 2:10</a>), “Have we not all one Father?” This was a philosophy not likely to be acceptable to the Athenians among whom the distinction between Greeks and Barbarians was as radical as that which has grown up in America between white man and “ ,” or between Europeans and natives in India.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for to dwell on all the face of the earth</span>] For His children the Father provided a home.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and hath determined the times before appointed</span>] The word <span class="greekheb">προστεταγμένους</span> has more authority than <span class="greekheb">προτεταγμένους</span> and gives a better sense. The times (rather <span class="ital">seasons</span>) are appointed unto men, but it is not so clear what “before-appointed” could mean. Read “<span class="ital">And hath determined</span> <span class="bld">their appointed seasons</span>.” (So <span class="ital">R.

From the unity of God Paul deduces the unity of the human race, all created by God, all sprung from one ancestor, or one blood (whichever reading we take), and so not to have their several national gods, but all to be united in the worship of the one true and living God, the Father of them all. It may be remarked by the way that the languages of the earth, differing like the skins and the features of the different races, and corresponding to those various bounds assigned by God to their habitations, yet bear distinct and emphatic testimony to this unity.
