St. John, who was present at the Council (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), and who, though he took no part in the debate, may well have had a share in drawing up the letter, uses a like mode of speech, “They went out from us, but they were not of us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-19.htm" title="They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us: but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they were not all of us.">1John 2:19</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Subverting your souls.</span>—The Greek verb, literally, <span class= "ital">turning upside down, </span>implies throwing into a state of excitement and agitation. The Gentiles had been “unsettled” by the teaching of the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">And keep the law.</span>—Assuming the Epistle of St. James to have been already written, there is something almost like a touch of irony in his repeating the phrase of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">James 2:10</a>. The teachers who bade the Gentiles keep the Law were reminded in that Epistle that they, in their servile respect of persons, were breaking the Law deliberately in one point, and were therefore guilty of all. Putting the two passages together, they bring St. James before us as speaking in the very accents of St. Paul, “Thou, therefore, which teachest another, teachest thou not thyself?” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-21.htm" title="You therefore which teach another, teach you not yourself? you that preach a man should not steal, do you steal?">Romans 2:21</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">To whom we gave no such commandment.</span>—The word “such” is a needless interpolation. What St. James declares is that the teachers had had no commission of any kind from him. The passage is important as throwing light on the nature of a later claim set up by the same party (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:...">Acts 15:24-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Forasmuch as we have heard, </span>&c. — The simplicity, weightiness, and conciseness of this letter, are highly observable; <span class="ital">that certain which went out from us </span>— That is, pretending to be sent out by us; <span class="ital">have troubled you with words </span>— By requiring you to be circumcised and to keep the law; <span class="ital">subverting your souls </span>— That is, unsettling your minds; <span class="ital">to</span> <span class="ital">whom we gave no such commandment — </span>No commission to make use of our names, or teach any such doctrine. <span class="ital">It seemed good unto us </span>— After duly considering the matter in a general assembly, called for the purpose; <span class="ital">to send chosen men unto you </span>— Men of our own body; <span class="ital">with our beloved Barnabas and Paul </span>— Whom we greatly respect, as <span class="ital">men that have hazarded their lives </span>— In repeated instances, and with great courage; <span class="ital">for the name of our Lord Jesus </span>— Such a testimony as this to the reputation of Paul and Barnabas was by no means a mere compliment, but exceedingly prudent, as it might tend to remove the prejudices conceived against them by the Jewish converts or teachers, who, as appears from many passages of the epistles, endeavoured as much as possible to lessen the character of these apostles. It would also be an evidence of the harmony subsisting between them and those of the circumcision. <span class="ital">We have sent therefore Judas and Silas </span>— Men that have heard our debates, and are perfectly acquainted with our judgment and decision. This precaution of sending approved witnesses along with the copy of the decree, which was delivered to Barnabas and Paul, was intended to prevent the zealous and bigoted Judaizers from affirming that the letter did not contain a just account of what was determined by the church. For these chosen men, having assisted at the council, would not only tell the brethren of Antioch the same things by mouth, but attest that it was the unanimous opinion of the whole assembly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:22-35 Being warranted to declare themselves directed by the immediate influence of the Holy Ghost, the apostles and disciples were assured that it seemed good unto God the Holy Spirit, as well as to them, to lay upon the converts no other burden than the things before mentioned, which were necessary, either on their own account, or from present circumstances. It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch - Since we have heard.<p>That certain - That some, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>.<p>Have troubled you with words - With doctrines.

It properly means "to collect together the vessels used in a house the household furniture - for the purpose of removing it." It is applied to marauders, robbers, and enemies who remove and bear off property, thus producing distress, confusion, and disorder. It is thus used in the sense of disturbing or destroying, and here denotes that they "unsettled their minds" - that they produced anxiety, disturbance, and distress by these doctrines about Moses.<p>To whom we gave no such commandment - They went, therefore, without authority. Self-constituted and self-sent teachers not infrequently produce disturbance and distress. Had the apostles been consulted on this subject, the difficulty would have been avoided. By thus saying that they had not given them a command to teach these things, they practically assured the Gentile converts that they did not approve of the course which those who went from Judea had taken. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-27.

By the report of Paul and Barnabas, who were sent by the church at Antioch to Jerusalem, to acquaint them with the state of their case: <p>that certain which went out from us; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a><p>have troubled you with words, or doctrines: <p>subverting your souls; removing them from the doctrine of grace to another Gospel, and which deserved not the name of a Gospel; and was very destructive to their souls, at least to the peace and com fort of them: this shows what an opinion the apostles, and elders, and members of the church at Jerusalem had of these "judaizing" preachers, and their tenets; they looked upon them as troublers of God's Israel, and upon their doctrines as subversive of spiritual joy and comfort. <p>Saying, ye must be circumcised and keep the law; the ceremonial law; the Alexandrian copy, and the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions leave out this clause; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm">Acts 15:5</a>. <p>to whom we gave no such commandment: it looks as if these "judaizing preachers" not only pretended to be sent out by the apostles, to preach; but that they had particularly this in their instructions from them, that they should insist upon it, that the Gentiles that were received into the churches, should be circumcised, and be obliged to keep the other parts of the ceremonial law, when they had no such orders from them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> went out from us have troubled you with words, <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> subverting your souls, saying, <i>Ye must</i> be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no <i>such</i> commandment:</span><p>(10) The council of Jerusalem concludes that the ones who trouble men's consciences are they who teach us to seek salvation in any other means than in Christ alone, apprehended by faith, no matter where they come from, and whoever they pretend to be the author of their calling.<p>(k) From our congregation.<p>(l) A borrowed type of speech taken of those who pull down that which was built up: and it is a very common metaphor in the scriptures, to say the Church is built, for the Church is planted and established.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>. On the similarity of this verse in phraseology to St. Luke’s preface, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-1.htm" title="For as much as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,">Luke 1:1</a>, Schwegler, Zeller, Weiss, Friedrich, Hilgenfeld, and others have commented. But, after all, in what does the likeness consist? Simply in the fact that here as there we have <span class="greekheb">ἐπειδή</span> introducing the antecedent clause, and <span class="greekheb">ἔδοξεν</span> the subsequent clause. Friedrich (p. 46) considers this as too striking to be a matter of chance, but strangely he writes each of the two passages as if they commenced with the same word, see below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-28.htm" title="For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay on you no greater burden than these necessary things;">Acts 15:28</a>—<span class="greekheb">ἐπειδήπερ</span>.

From this comes the more general meaning to lay waste, or ravage. The idea here is that of turning the minds of the Gentile converts upside down; throwing them into confusion like a dismantled house.<p>We gave no commandment (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787; &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;)<p>The word originally means to put asunder; hence, to distinguish, and so of a commandment or injunction, to distinguish and emphasize it. Therefore implying express orders, and so always in the New Testament, where it is almost uniformly rendered charge. The idea here is, then, "we gave no express injunction on the points which these Judaizers have raised." </body></html>
