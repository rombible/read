It bore its witness that the government of the Christian society was not to rest in the autocracy of a single will, but in the deliberative decision of those who, directly or indirectly, having been appointed by the choice, or with the approval, of the people, represented the whole community. Presbyters had an equal voice with the Apostles, whose position was analogous to that of the later bishops. Those whom we should call the laity were present at the deliberations, and, though we have no absolute proof that they took part in them, gave their vote. (Comp. Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-23.htm" title="And they wrote letters by them after this manner; The apostles and elders and brothers send greeting to the brothers which are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia.">Acts 15:23</a>.) Strictly speaking, it was, in the later ecclesiastical language, a provincial and not an œcumenical synod, called to decide what seemed a question of discipline rather than of doctrine; but the ground on which the question had been argued made it one of world-wide dogmatic importance. If circumcision was necessary, then faith in Christ was insufficient. St. Paul saw and felt this in all its fulness, and therefore would not “give way by subjection, no, not for an hour” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm" title="To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.">Galatians 2:5</a>). We have no <span class= "ital">data</span> for estimating the number of the presbyters who were present. Probably they included those of the neighbouring towns and villages of Judæa as well as of Jerusalem, and if so, we may fairly think of some number between fifty and a hundred.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-6.htm" title="And the apostles and elders came together for to consider of this matter....">Acts 15:6-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the apostles, &c., came together to consider of this matter </span>— As the apostles commonly resided at Jerusalem, the greater part of them may have come together on this occasion; and the elders likewise, men most respectable for their grace and gifts, having been chosen to the office of elders from among those on whom the Holy Ghost descended on the day of pentecost. Many of the brethren, too, of the church of Jerusalem were present in this assembly. For the decree, which was passed on the question, runs in the name of the whole church. <span class="ital">And when there had been much disputing </span>— Occasioned by those of the sect of the Pharisees, who maintained the necessity of circumcision. It does not appear that this debate was among the apostles themselves; but if it was, if they themselves really debated the matter first, yet might their final decision be from an unerring direction. For how really soever they were inspired, we need not suppose their inspiration was always so instantaneous and express, as to supersede any deliberation in their own minds, or any consultation with each other. <span class="ital">Peter rose up </span>— And put the assembly in mind, how he had been ordered by God to preach the gospel to Cornelius and the other Gentiles who were with him; and how <span class="ital">God, who knoweth the hearts </span>of men, <span class="ital">bare them witness </span>— That he accepted them without circumcision, having given them the Holy Ghost, even as to the Jews, <span class="ital">and put no difference between them </span>— And the Jews; <span class="ital">purifying their hearts </span>— Not by the rites and ceremonies of the law, but <span class="ital">by faith. Now therefore </span>— Said he, why do ye not acquiesce in such a determination? <span class="ital">Why tempt ye God to put a yoke on the neck of the disciples </span>— So grievous and burdensome, that <span class="ital">neither our fathers nor we were able to bear it? </span>— Why provoke ye God by making circumcision necessary to the salvation of the Gentiles, contrary to his declared will in this matter, and contrary to your own conviction. For <span class="ital">we </span>— Who have been educated in the Jewish religion, and especially we who are apostles, <span class="ital">believe, that through the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</span> — And not through obedience to the law of Moses, <span class="ital">we </span>— Jews, <span class="ital">shall be saved even as they </span>— The Gentiles, are to be saved; in one and the same way, namely, through the grace of Christ alone.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-6 Some from Judea taught the Gentile converts at Antioch, that they could not be saved, unless they observed the whole ceremonial law as given by Moses; and thus they sought to destroy Christian liberty. There is a strange proneness in us to think that all do wrong who do not just as we do. Their doctrine was very discouraging. Wise and good men desire to avoid contests and disputes as far as they can; yet when false teachers oppose the main truths of the gospel, or bring in hurtful doctrines, we must not decline to oppose them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the apostles and elders ... - They came together in accordance with the authority in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-19.htm">Matthew 18:19-20</a>.
