This in itself was a proof of his interest in the mission-work among the Gentiles, and no one, perhaps, could be found so well fitted to fill the place of Barnabas. He too had the gift of prophetic utterance, and, as we have seen (Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>), was probably able to speak as one who had followed the Lord Jesus, and could bear witness of the Resurrection.<p><span class= "bld">Being recommended by the brethren.</span>—See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a>.

It does not follow from the historian's silence that Barnabas was not so recommended, too; for this is the last mention of Barnabas in the history, whose sole object now is to relate the proceedings of Paul. Nor does it seem quite fair (with De Wette, Meyer, Howson, Alford, Hacket, Webster and Wilkinson, &c.) to conclude from this that the Church at Antioch took that marked way of showing their sympathy with Paul in opposition to Barnabas.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The favour of God, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a></span>, which the wisest and holiest men stand in need of in all their undertakings; as also his gracious conduct and assistance. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Paul chose Silas,....

This sympathy on the part of Silas would be the more marked and significant as he was himself almost certainly a Hebrew; otherwise we cannot account for his high position in the Jerusalem Church, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>, although his Roman citizenship is implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>; perhaps this latter fact may account for his freedom from narrow Jewish prejudices.

For St. Peter’s First Epistle contains the names of the two men, Mark and Silvanus, who had originally been members of the Jerusalem Church, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-22.htm" title="Then pleased it the apostles and elders with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas and Silas, chief men among the brothers:">Acts 15:22</a>, and moreover the two oldest of St. Paul’s associates, whose brotherly Christian concord had been broken for the time (when Paul chose the latter in the place of Barnabas, and rejected Mark’s services altogether), but who are now both found at St. Peter’s side in Rome (assuming that Babylon is Rome), evidently at one with him and with each other; the one the bearer of a letter, the other the sender of greetings, to <span class="ital">Pauline</span> Churches. If St. Paul had passed to his rest, and the leader had thus changed, the teaching was the same, as the names of Silvanus and Mark assure us, and St. Peter takes up and carries on the work of the Apostle of the Gentiles, see Dr. Swete, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 87, 88.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξῆλθε</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-6.htm" title="And they departed, and went through the towns, preaching the gospel, and healing every where.">Luke 9:6</a>, 3 John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-7.htm" title="And when there had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said to them, Men and brothers, you know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.">Acts 15:7</a>, where the word is used of going forth for missionary work.—<span class="greekheb">παραδοθεὶς</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-26.htm" title="And there sailed to Antioch, from where they had been recommended to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.">Acts 14:26</a>.
