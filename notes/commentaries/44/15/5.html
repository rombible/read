The position which they occupied was that of accepting Jesus as a teacher sent from God, proved by the Resurrection to be the Christ, and as such the Head of a kingdom which was to present to mankind a restored and glorified Judaism, the Law kept in its completeness, the Temple ritual still maintained, Gentiles admitted only on their confessing their inferiority and accepting the sign of incorporation with the superior race. It appears, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a>, that here, as in so many later controversies, the general issue was debated on an individual case. Was Titus—a Greek, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a Gentile, whom St. Paul had brought up with him—to be circumcised, or not? Was he to be admitted to communion with the Church, or treated as a heathen? Here, probably, there was no official rank as in the case of Cornelius, no previous transition stage in passing through the synagogue as a proselyte of the gate. He was a Gentile pure and simple, and as such his case was a crucial one. Circumcision, however, did not stand alone. It carried with it every jot and tittle of the Law, the Sabbaths and the feasts, the distinction between clean and unclean meats. It may be noted that the position which Titus occupied in this controversy gave him a special fitness for the work afterwards assigned to him, of contending against the party of the circumcision, with their “Jewish fables” and false standards of purity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm" title="For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, specially they of the circumcision:">Titus 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth.">Titus 1:14-15</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-6 Some from Judea taught the Gentile converts at Antioch, that they could not be saved, unless they observed the whole ceremonial law as given by Moses; and thus they sought to destroy Christian liberty.

The teachers at Antioch had not been described as Pharisees though they probably were so. But in no other passage of the N. T. are the Pharisees mentioned away from Jerusalem. As soon as the Apostolic narrative was heard by the church certain of their party <span class="ital">stood forth from</span> the church body and lodged their protest against what had been done. The Pharisaic teaching concerning the necessity of circumcision was based on such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a>, where the covenant mentioned was held to be that of circumcision. And they supported their position by such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/52-1.htm" title="Awake, awake; put on your strength, O Zion; put on your beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for from now on there shall no more come into you the uncircumcised and the unclean.">Isaiah 52:1</a>, where the uncircumcised are excluded from the holy city.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">saying, That it was needful</span>] Better, “saying, <span class="ital">It is</span> needful, &c.” The words are a direct utterance, and suit better so rendered with St Luke’s narrative, in which he is describing what occurred before the church at Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The visit of St Paul to Jerusalem which St Luke here describes is now generally admitted to be the same of which St Paul speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-9</a>. The chronology offers no obstacle to this conclusion, while the purpose of the visit, and the companionship of Barnabas and the persons who were at the head of the church in Jerusalem are all accordant in the two notices. In the Epistle, St Paul tells us that he took Titus with him, and nothing is more likely than that while he had the company of some members of the Judaizing party, he would also take a companion with him from among those converts on whose behalf he was making the journey. He says too that it was ‘by revelation’ that he went up, while the narrative of the Acts represents him as sent by the church of Antioch. But here need be no contradiction. An inward monition may have furnished the true reason why the Apostle consented to make an appeal to the central authorities in Jerusalem. St Luke would not necessarily be aware of this; it was important in St Paul’s argument to the Galatians that he should mention it. (For a fuller comparison of the two notices, see Bp Lightfoot’s <span class="ital">Ep. to Galatians</span>, note, pp. 122–127.)<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐξανέοτησαν</span>, <span class="ital">rose up</span>) before the rest, at Jerusalem.—<span class="greekheb">Φαρισαίων</span>, <span class="ital">of the Pharisees</span>) Even converted persons have from time to time accompanying them their former state of the understanding, of the will, and of the affections.—<span class="greekheb">πεπιστευκότες</span>, <span class="ital">who had believed</span>) who had passed from Judaism to Christianity.—[<span class="greekheb">δεῖ</span>, <span class="ital">it is needful</span>) They were not waiting for the decision of the apostles.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">τὸν νόμον Μωϋσέως</span>, <span class="ital">the law of Moses</span>) Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-24.htm" title="For as much as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, You must be circumcised, and keep the law: to whom we gave no such commandment:">Acts 15:24</a>.

[The division of the law into the moral and ceremonial was not as familiar to the Jews as it is to us; for both alike were then in force.] And yet in this passage a more express mention of the moral law is not to be thought requisite: for Paul, although he denied that righteousness (justification) is to be obtained by it, yet “established the law:” <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-31.htm" title="Do we then make void the law through faith?
