Barnabas wished his nephew John Mark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, and guard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not think him worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departed from them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But Paul thought not good - Did not think it proper.

He did not think him worthy, or a fit and proper person to go with them, as the word used seems to signify, and therefore he refused to take him: the Syriac version renders it, "but Paul would not take him with them"; and, the Ethiopic version is very expressive, though it renders it in softer language, "Paul prayed, or entreated Barnabas that he would leave Mark"; that is, behind them at Antioch: his reasons were as follow: <p>who departed from them from Pamphylia; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm">Acts 13:13</a>; either through the fatigue of the journey, or fear of danger, or weariness in his work, or affection to his mother; or be it what it will, it seems in the apostle's opinion of the matter, he was very blameworthy, and on account of it very undeserving, at least at present, of being a companion of theirs in their travels: <p>and went not with them to the work; the Arabic version adds, "of preaching"; that is, the Gospel, in the several places whither they went, and to which the Holy Ghost had called them, and for which the church at Antioch had separated, and sent them forth; but in the midst of this John deserted them; and which the apostle resented, he having, as yet, not given any evidence of his sense of his evil, and of his repentance for it, to his satisfaction; though it seems as if he afterwards did, since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a> he speaks of him with great respect, as one of his fellow workers, and who had been a comfort to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work....">Acts 15:38-39</a>. <span class="ital">But Paul judged it not right</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἠξίου</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm" title="But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.">Acts 28:22</a>; Xen. <span class="ital">Anab.</span> v. 5. 9; <span class="ital">Mem.</span> ii. 1. 9) <span class="ital">to take with them this one who had fallen away from them from Pamphylia, etc.</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm" title="Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.">Acts 13:13</a>).[45] Observe the <span class="greekheb">μὴ συμπαραλαβεῖν</span> standing in sharp opposition to the <span class="greekheb">συμπαραλαβεῖν</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-37.htm" title="And Barnabas determined to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 15:37</a>, and the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτον</span> significantly repeated at the close.

"He did not go with them to <span class="accented">the work"</span> to which God called them, as he ought to have done. The whole phrase, too, which follows is strongly worded. "Paul thought good," as regards one who had turned back from the work, "not <span class="accented">to take</span> that man." The <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 38 is, as Meyer observes, sharply opposed to the <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> of ver. 37. Luke evidently sides strongly with Paul, and almost reproduces the <span class="accented">ipsis-sima verba</span> of the "sharp contention." One would infer that this passage was penned by Luke before the reconciliation which appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, and that we have here an indication of the early date of the publication of "The Acts." Perhaps also there is an indication in the narrative, coupled with Mark's subsequent attach-merit to Peter, that Mark rather leant at this time to Judaizing views, and that his previous departure "from the work" was partly owing to a want of complete sympathy with St. Paul's doctrine. St. Paul would have no half-hearted helper in his grand and arduous work. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Him (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., that one.
