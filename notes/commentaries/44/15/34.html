It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding ... - This whole verse is missing in many mss.; in the Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic versions; and is regarded as spurious by Mill, Griesbach, and by other critics. It was probably introduced by some early transcriber, who judged it necessary to complete the narrative. The Latin Vulgate reads, "It seemed good to Silas to remain, but Judas went alone to Jerusalem." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34, 35. it pleased Silas&#8212;Silas determined.<p>to abide there still&#8212;(The authorities against the insertion of this verse are strong. It may have been afterwards added to explain Ac 15:40). Doubtless the attraction to Antioch for Silas was Paul's presence there, to whom he seems to have now formed that permanent attachment which the sequel of this book and Paul's Epistles show to have existed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Though, having performed his message, he was discharged, and might have returned; yet, for the further benefit of that church, he continued at Antioch. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still,.... Though he had leave to go, and was actually dismissed with Judas; and doubtless intended to have gone with him, but for some reason or another he changed his mind, and thought fit to continue at Antioch some time longer: and the design of Providence in it seems to have been this; that he might be a companion with the Apostle Paul in his travels among the Gentiles, as he afterwards was, and was very useful to him. This verse is wanting in the Alexandrian copy, and in the Syriac and Arabic versions; the Ethiopic version reads, "and Paul proposed", or "determined to abide", as he did some little time longer, as appears from the following verse: the Vulgate Latin version here adds, and "Judas went alone to Jerusalem"; and so it is read in one of Beza's copies, and in one of Stephens's. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-34.htm" title="Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.">Acts 15:34</a>.

The question is left in doubt by the Greek MSS., and by the arguments derived from the context: whence we have marked it in the Apparatus, pp. 625, 626, as equally balanced on both sides, although in the same place, and in the margin, we have prefixed an obelus. [But the case is otherwise in the margin of ed. ii., which is followed by the Vers. Germ. And now it will be of use to compare App. Crit., ed. ii., on this passage.[93]] But now we embrace the opinion derived from the Greek MSS. which contain the verse, especially since the versions, the Æthiopic and Arabic, quoted in Ludov. de Dieu, contain it, and the Coptic (Memphitic) in the excerpta sent by La Crozius is not opposed to it.[94] In the other authorities, when Luke, who is different both in name and in the derivation of his name, and in reality, from Silas (see <span class="ital">Ord. Temp.</span>, p. 278; ed. ii., p. 239), had written, <span class="greekheb">ἀπελύθησαν</span>—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς τοὺς ἀποστείλαντας αὐτοὺς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἔδοξε δὲ τῷ Σίλᾳ ἐπιμεῖναι αὐτοῦ</span>, the leap was made from <span class="greekheb">αὐτοὺς</span> to <span class="greekheb">αὐτῦ</span>, which caused the hiatus in the Codex Alexandrinus and others, and in the Greek commentators, concerning whom in this passage the Anti-Millius of Whitby is silent, and also in the Syriac version. I feel grateful to my very great friend, D. Hauber, who was the cause of my weighing the present passage more carefully. But the same friend thinks that Silas went to Jerusalem with the intention of returning, and that thence there is ascribed to him an <span class="ital">abiding</span> at Antioch.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[93] CD Vulg.

But Silas may have returned to Jerusalem, as stated in ver. 33, and come back again to Antioch, from having formed a strong attachment to St. Paul and his views. </body></html>
