The Jews claimed for themselves the exclusive right to the latter term. They alone were the “people,” the rest of mankind were the “nations”—the “heathen.” St. James proclaims that out of those heathen nations a people had been taken who were as truly God’s people as Israel had ever been. He, too, recognises the change as fully as St. Paul does, when in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-26.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people; there shall they be called the children of the living God.">Romans 9:26</a> he quotes the memorable prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>. St. James as well as St. Peter had, it is clear, profited by the private teaching referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Simeon - This is a Hebrew name.

James begins with taking notice of Peter's speech, and agrees to it, and confirms it; for by Simeon is not meant, as some have thought, the Simeon that took Christ in his arms, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm">Luke 2:25</a> who had been dead long ago; but Simon Peter, who had spoken before. Simon and Simeon are one and the same name; the former is only a contraction of the latter in the Syriac language; Simeon was his pure Hebrew name, and James speaking to an assembly of Hebrews, uses it; and observes, that he had given a very clear and distinct narrative, how God at the first preaching of the Gospel, quickly after the day of Pentecost, was pleased to look upon the Gentiles, and show favour to them, and visit them in a way of grace and mercy, by sending the Gospel to them, and his Spirit to make it effectual: this was a gracious visit; he came and looked upon them, quickened them, and spoke comfortably to them, and bestowed special favours upon them; the set time for such a visit being come: the Arabic version renders it, "how God first promised"; referring to the promises concerning the calling of the Gentiles, which James afterwards confirms by citing a passage out of the prophets to the same purpose: the Syriac version, "how God began to choose out of the Gentiles": that is, by calling them by his grace; and the Ethiopic version, "how God first had mercy on the Gentiles"; who before had not obtained mercy: <p>to take out of them a people for his name; for himself, for his own glory, to call upon his name, and to be called by his name, to bear his name, and support his Gospel, cause and interest: the distinguishing grace of God may be seen herein; it was grace to visit them, to look upon them, when for many hundreds of years he had overlooked them, he had taken no notice of them; and it was distinguishing grace to take some out of them, to be a special and peculiar people to himself; to separate them from the rest by his powerful and efficacious grace, and form them into a church state, that they might show forth his praise and glorify him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Simeon hath declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.</span><p>(7) James confirms the calling of the Gentiles out of the word of God, in this agreeing with Peter.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name....">Acts 15:14-17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συμεών</span>] formed after the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">שִׁמְעוֹן</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm" title="Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:">2 Peter 1:1</a>; LXX. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-33.htm" title="And she conceived again, and bore a son; and said, Because the LORD has heard I was hated, he has therefore given me this son also: and she called his name Simeon.">Genesis 29:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-25.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was just and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Ghost was on him.">Luke 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-30.htm" title="Which was the son of Simeon, which was the son of Juda, which was the son of Joseph, which was the son of Jonan, which was the son of Eliakim,">Luke 3:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-7.htm" title="Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand.

The Jews after they came to have much intercourse with Gentiles had frequently two forms of name, one of which was employed on religious and solemn occasions, the other in intercourse with non-Jews and in the ordinary transactions of life. Thus in the Apocrypha (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-17.htm" title="Then said Judas unto Simon his brother, Choose thee out men, and go and deliver thy brethren that are in Galilee, for I and Jonathan my brother will go into the country of Galaad.">1Ma 5:17</a>, &c.) the name of the Maccabean prince is written <span class="ital">Simon</span>, though on his coins it stands <span class="ital">Symeon</span> (see Gesenius, <span class="ital">s.v.</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">how God at the first</span>] Better, <span class="ital">how God did first visit</span>, &c. It was not <span class="ital">at the first</span>, but some time after the mission of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles that Cornelius was converted. What St Peter had narrated was the <span class="ital">first</span> acceptance of a Gentile into the church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">visit the Gentiles</span>] In the old sense of “look upon,” and generally with the accompanying notion of kindness. (Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm" title="Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he has visited and redeemed his people,">Luke 1:68</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm" title="Through the tender mercy of our God; whereby the dayspring from on high has visited us,">Luke 1:78</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-16.htm" title="And there came a fear on all: and they glorified God, saying, That a great prophet is risen up among us; and, That God has visited his people.">Luke 7:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm" title="But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man, that you are mindful of him? or the son of man that you visit him?">Hebrews 2:6</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a people for his name</span>] Thus “the chosen people” were no longer to be Jews only, and so those ceremonial ordinances which had hitherto marked out Jews from Gentiles might be seen to be unnecessary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-14.htm" title="Simeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.">Acts 15:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συμεὼν</span>) The Latin Vulg. has <span class="ital">Simon</span> [So Amiat.

This is the only place (unless <span class="accented">Symeon</span> is the right reading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-1.htm">2 Peter 1:1</a>) in which Simon Peter's name is given in this Hebrew form, which is most proper in the month of James speaking to Palestine Jews. Singularly enough, Chrysostom was misled by it, and thought the prophecy of Simeon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-31.htm">Luke 1:31</a> was meant, <span class="cmt_word">How first</span>; corresponding to the" good while ago" of ver. 7. <span class="cmt_word">Did visit</span>, etc. The construction <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> is very unusual, and indeed stands alone. The verb always has an accusative case after it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-3.htm">Acts 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-23.htm">Acts 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-36.htm">Acts 15:36</a>), unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-68.htm">Luke 1:68</a> is an exception, which, however, it hardly is. There are two ways of construing the phrase. One is to consider it as elliptical, and to supply, as the A.V. and R.V. do, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x1f75;</span>. So Alford, who compares the construction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-25.htm">Luke 1:25</a>, where <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;</span> must be supplied. But this is a harsh construction. The other and better way is to take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>, not in the sense of" visiting," but of" looking out," or "endeavoring to find something." The sense of the infinitive after the verb is nearly equivalent to" look out for and took," literally, <span class="accented">looked out how he might take.</span> With a slight modification of meaning, Irenaeus (in 'Speaker's Commentary') renders it" Excogitavit accipere," "planned" or "contrived to take." <span class="cmt_word">A people for his Name</span>; 1.<span class="accented">e.</span> to be called by his Name. <span class="greek">&#x39b;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> was the peculiar designation of "the people" of God, answering to the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dd;</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-10.htm">1 Peter 2:10</a>, <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f50;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>). </body></html>
