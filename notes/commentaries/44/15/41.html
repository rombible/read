Barnabas wished his nephew John Mark to go with them. We should suspect ourselves of being partial, and guard against this in putting our relations forward. Paul did not think him worthy of the honour, nor fit for the service, who had departed from them without their knowledge, or without their consent: see ch.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Syria and Cilicia - These were countries lying near to each other, which Paul, in company with Barnabas, had before visited.<p>Confirming the churches - Strengthening them by instruction and exhortation. It has no reference to the rite of confirmation. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>.<p>In regard to this unhappy contention between Paul and Barnabas, and their separation from each other, we may make the following remarks:<p>(1) That no apology or vindication of it is offered by the sacred writer. It was undoubtedly improper and evil. It was a melancholy instance in which even apostles evinced an improper spirit, and engaged in improper strife.<p>(2) in this contention it is probable that Paul was, in the main, right. Barnabas seems to have been influenced by attachment to a relative; Paul sought a helper who would not shrink from duty and danger. It is clear that Paul had the sympathies and prayers of the church in his favor <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-40.htm">Acts 15:40</a>, and it is more than probable that Barnabas departed without any such sympathy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-39.htm">Acts 15:39</a>.<p>(3) there is reason to think that this contention was overruled for the furtherance of the gospel. They went to different places, and preached to different people. It often happens that the unhappy and wicked strifes of Christians are the means of exciting their mutual zeal, and of extending the gospel, and of establishing churches. But no thanks to their contention; nor is the guilt of their anger and strife mitigated by this.<p>(4) this difference was afterward reconciled, and Paul and Barnabas again became traveling companions, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-6.htm">1 Corinthians 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>.<p>(5) there is evidence that Paul also became reconciled to John Mark, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-10.htm">Colossians 4:10</a>; Plm 1:24; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>. How long this separation continued is not known; but perhaps in this journey with Barnabas John gave such evidence of his courage and zeal as induced Paul again to admit him to his confidence as a traveling companion, and as to become a profitable fellow-laborer. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm">2 Timothy 4:11</a>, "Take Mark, and bring him with thee; for he is profitable to me for the ministry."<p>(6) this account proves that there was no collusion or agreement among the apostles to impose upon mankind. Had there been such an agreement, and had the books of the New Testament been an imposture, the apostles would have been represented as perfectly harmonious, and as united in all their views and efforts. What impostor would have thought of the device of representing the early friends of the Christian religion as divided, and contending, and separating from each other? Such a statement has an air of candor and honesty, and at the same time is apparently so much against the truth of the system, that no impostor would have thought of resorting to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>41. and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches&#8212;"It is very likely that Paul and Barnabas made a deliberate and amicable arrangement to divide the region of their first mission between them; Paul taking the continental, and Barnabas the insular, part of the proposed visitation. If Barnabas visited Salamis and Paphos, and if Paul (travelling westward), after passing through Derbe, Lystra, and Iconium, went as far as Antioch in Pisidia, the whole circuit of the proposed visitation was actually accomplished, for it does not appear that any converts had been made at Perga and Attalia" [Howson]. "This second missionary tour appears to have proceeded at first solely from the desire of visiting the churches already planted.

And that there were also churches in Cilicia, is very manifest; and particularly there was one at Tarsus, the chief city in it.

In the "second" century there was a church in that city, to which Ignatius wrote an epistle, still extant (o), in which he makes mention of Philo their deacon: in the "third" century Helenus presided over this church, and was present at a synod at Antioch, when Paulus Samosatenus was condemned for heresy (p): in the "fourth" century mention is made of several churches in Cilicia, and the bishops of them; there was a church at Apsis in Cilicia, Amphion was bishop of Epiphania, Theodorus of Mopsuestia, Cyriacus of Adanan, and Sylvanus of Tarsus, the metropolis; in which last place, in the beginning of this century, several martyrs suffered under Dioclesian, particularly Tharatus, Probus, and Andronicus: here the orthodox, in the times of Valens, would have convened a synod against the Arians, but were hindered by him; and in this century Diodorus, bishop of Tarsus, had the care of all the churches in Cilicia committed to him; in this age also we read of Antoninus, a presbyter of this church, afterwards made bishop of it: in the "fifth" century mention is made of the bishops of several churches in Cilicia, as of Mopsuesta, Irenopolis, Epiphania, Tarsus, Anazarbus, Sebaste, and others who were present at several councils held at different places in this century; in the "sixth" century, out of the cities of Cilicia, Jotapa, Pisidia, Pompeiopolis, Tarsus, Coricus, Anemurius, bishops are said to come to the synod at Rome and Constantinople: in the seventh century, Tarsus was the metropolitan church of Cilicia; and mention is made of the bishops of that and of other cities in this country, who assisted at the sixth council at Constantinople: in the "eighth" century, notice is taken of a Church at Sida in Cilicia (q); so long the Christian name was in those parts.

If we cannot fully endorse this, it is at all events noticeable that critics of widely different schools of thought have refused to regard the alleged differences between the two as irreconcilable; in this conservative writers like Lechler, Godet, Belser, Knabenbauer and Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, ii., 627, 628; scientific critics, as we may call them, like Reuss, B. Weiss; and still more advanced critics like Lipsius and H. Holtzmann are agreed. This general agreement is recognised and endorsed by Wendt, p. 255 (1899), see also K. Schmidt, “Apostelkonvent,” in <span class="ital">Real-Encyclopädie für protest. Theol.</span> (Hauck), p. 704 ff. Amongst English writers Lightfoot, Hort, Sanday, Salmon, Drummond, Turner may be quoted on the same side (so too McGiffert, <span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 208), (see for the points of agreement, Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 123; Drummond, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 73 ff.; Salmon, “Galatians,” B.D.2; Reuss, <span class="ital">Geschichte des h. . des N.

But the recent forcible attempt of Professor Ramsay to identify <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a> with St. Paul’s second visit to Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>, and not with the third visit, Acts 15, has opened up the whole question again (see on the same identification recently proposed from a very different point of view by Völter, <span class="ital">Witness of the Epistles</span>, p. 231, and also by Spitta, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 184). At first sight it is no doubt in favour of this conclusion that according to Acts the journey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>, is the second made by St. Paul to Jerusalem, and the journey in 15 the third, whilst <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a> also describes a journey which the Apostle himself represents as his second to the mother-city. We cannot fairly solve this difficulty by cutting the knot with McGiffert, who regards <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-15.htm" title="And as I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us at the beginning.">Acts 11:15</a> as = <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a>, and thinks that Luke found two independent accounts of the same journey, and supposed them to refer to separate events (<span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, p. 171); or by concluding with Drummond, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 78, that the writer of Acts made a mistake in bringing St. Paul to Jerusalem at the time of the famine, so that Galatians 2 and Acts 15 both refer to his second visit (<span class="ital">cf.</span> to the same effect, Wendt, p. 218 (1899), who looks upon the visit described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-25.htm" title="Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul:">Acts 11:25</a> as a mistake of the author, at all events as regards Paul). But McGiffert and Drummond are both right in emphasising one most important and, as it seems to us, crucial difficulty in the way of the view advocated by Ramsay; if he is correct, it is difficult to see any object in the visit described in Acts 15. After the decision already arrived at in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a> : <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>, the question then <span class="ital">ex hypothesi</span> at issue could scarcely have been raised again in the manner described in Acts 15. Moreover, whilst Ramsay admits that another purpose was achieved by the journey to Jerusalem described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a>, although only as a mere private piece of business, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 57, he maintains that the special and primary object of the visit was to relieve the poor. But if the pillars of the Church were already aware, as <span class="ital">ex hypothesi</span> they must have been aware, that St. Paul came to Jerusalem bringing food and money for the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:...">Acts 11:29-30</a>), we may be pardoned for finding it difficult to believe that the “one charge alone” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>) which they gave him was to do the very thing which he actually came for the purpose of doing. If, too, Barnabas and Saul had just been associated in helping the poor, and if the expression <span class="greekheb">ὃ καὶ ἐσπούδασα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>, refers, as Professor Ramsay holds, to this service, we should hardly have expected Paul to use the first person singular, but rather to have associated Barnabas with himself in his reference to their work of love and danger. Professor Ramsay emphasises the fact (<span class="ital">Expositor</span>, p. 183, March, 1896) that Luke <span class="ital">pointedly records</span> that the distribution was carried out to its completion by Barnabas and Saul in person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>). Why then does Paul only refer to his own zeal in remembering the poor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-29.htm" title="Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief to the brothers which dwelled in Judaea:">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a> = <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a>?

Further: Dr. Sanday has emphasised the fact that at the time of St. Paul’s second visit to Jerusalem the state of things which we find in Acts 15 (the third visit) did not exist; that a stage in the controversy as to the terms of admission of Gentile converts had been reached by the date of Acts 15 which had not been reached at the date of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; that at this latter date, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, there was no such clear demarcation of spheres between St. Peter and St. Paul, and that it is not until <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-46.htm" title="Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing you put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, see, we turn to the Gentiles.">Acts 13:46</a> that the turning-point is actually reached: henceforth St. Paul assumes his true “Apostleship of the Gentiles,” and preaches a real “Gospel of the uncircumcision”; see especially <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, July, 1896, p. 62. Of course Professor Ramsay’s theory obliges us to place <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a> <span class="ital">before</span> the Apostolic Conference, and to suppose that when the events narrated in Galatians 2 took place, the journey of Acts 13, 14 was still in the future.

Mr. Turner, “Chronology of the N.T.,” Hastings’ B.D., i., 424, is inclined to adopt this view, which identifies the two Judaising missions from Jerusalem to Antioch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm" title="And certain men which came down from Judaea taught the brothers, and said, Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you cannot be saved.">Acts 15:1</a>, while he still maintains the ordinary view that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also....">Galatians 2:1-10</a> = Acts 15.

It may be noted that Paley, <span class="ital">Horæ Paulinæ</span>, v., 9, had remarked that there is nothing to hinder us from supposing that the dispute at Antioch was prior to the Conference at Jerusalem. Moreover it may be fairly urged that this view puts a more favourable construction on the conduct of St. James and St. Peter in relation to the compact which they had made with Paul at the Jerusalem Conference. But on the attitude of St. James and the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐλθεῖν τινὰς ἀπὸ Ἰακώβου</span>, see Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 79; Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm" title="For before that certain came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles: but when they were come, he withdrew and separated himself, fearing them which were of the circumcision.">Galatians 2:12</a>; Drummond, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 85; and with regard to the conduct of St. Peter, see Hort, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 76; Lightfoot on the collision at Antioch, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 125 ff.; and Salmon, “Galatians,” B.D.2, p. 1114; Drummond, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 78.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On Zahn’s position that the dispute between Peter and Paul took place before the Apostolic Conference, when the former betook himself to Antioch after his liberation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm" title="Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church to God for him.">Acts 12:5</a> ff, a view put forward also by Schneckenburger, <span class="ital">Zweck der Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 109 ff., see <span class="ital">Neue Kirchl.

Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>A further question arises as to why the particular prohibitions of the Decree are mentioned. According to a very common view they represented the Seven Precepts of Noah, six of which were said to have been given by God to Adam, while the seventh was given as an addition to Noah. The Seven Precepts were as follows: (1) against profanation of God’s name; (2) against idolatry; (3) against fornication; (4) against murder; (5) against theft; (6) to obey those in authority; (7) against eating living flesh, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, flesh with the blood in it, see Schürer <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. ii., p. 318, E.T.; Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 69. No doubt there are points of contact between these Precepts and the four Prohibitions of the Decree, but at the same time it would seem that there are certainly four of the Precepts to which there is nothing corresponding in the Decree. The Precepts were binding on every <span class="ital">Gêr Toshav</span>, a stranger sojourning in the land of Israel, but it has been erroneously supposed that the <span class="ital">Gêr Toshav</span> = <span class="greekheb">σεβόμενος</span>, and thus the conclusion is drawn that the idea of the four prohibitions was to place Gentiles on the footing of <span class="greekheb">σεβόμενοι</span> in the Christian community. Against this identification of the <span class="ital">Gêr Toshav</span> and the <span class="greekheb">σεβόμενος</span> Schürer’s words are decisive, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 318, 319. But if this view was valid historically, the position of the Gentile Christians under such conditions would have been far from satisfactory, and we cannot suppose that Paul would have regarded any such result as a success; still circumcision and the keeping of the law would have been necessary to entitle a man to the full privilege of the Christian Church and name. Ritschl, who takes practically the same view as Wendt below, admits that in a certain degree the Gentile Christians would be regarded as in an inferior position to the Jewish Christians, <span class="ital">Altkatholische Kirche</span>, pp. 131, 133, second edition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It seems even more difficult to trace the prohibitions of the Decree to the Levitical prohibitions, Leviticus 17, 18, which were binding on strangers or sojourners in Israel (LXX <span class="greekheb">προσήλυτοι</span>), since, if the written law was to be the source of the Jerusalem prohibitions, it is inexplicable that the variations from it both in matter and number should be so observable (Hort, <span class="ital">u. s.</span>, p. 70); and although Wendt (so Ritschl, Overbeck, Lipsius, Zöckler, Holtzmann, and others; see on the other hand, Weiss, <span class="ital">Biblische Theol.</span>, p. 145; Felten, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 297; Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Galatians</span>, p. 306; Hilgenfeld, <span class="ital">Zeitschrift für wissenschaft. Theol.</span>, i., 72, 73, 1896) adopts the view that in the four prohibitions of the Jerusalem Decree we have the form in which prohibitions binding upon proselytes in the wider sense, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, upon the uncircumcised <span class="greekheb">φοβούμ</span>. or <span class="greekheb">σεβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν Θεόν</span>, existed in the Apostolic days, he can only say that this is “very probable”: of direct historical evidence, as Zöckler admits, there is none. The difficulty is so great in supposing that Paul and Barnabas could have submitted to the distinction drawn between the Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians that it has led to doubts as to the historical character of the decree. Weizsäcker and McGiffert maintain that the decree was formulated after Paul’s departure, when James had reconsidered the matter, and had determined that some restriction should be put upon the complete Gentile liberty which had been previously granted. But this view can only be maintained by the sacrifice of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem.">Acts 16:4</a>, where Paul is distinctly said to have given the decrees to the Churches to keep.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ramsay, agreeing with Lightfoot, calls the Decree a compromise, and although, as he points out, it seems impossible to suppose that St. Paul would have endorsed a decree which thus made mere points of ritual compulsory, it is probable, he thinks, that after the exordium in which the Jewish party had been so emphatically condemned, the concluding part of the Decree would be regarded as a strong recommendation that the four points should be observed in the interests of peace and amity (<span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 172). In a previous passage, p. 167, he seems to take a very similar view to Wendt, who answers the question as to how the Precepts of the Decree were to be observed by the Gentile converts by maintaining that they were an attempt to make intercourse more feasible between the Jewish Christians and their Gentile brethren, p. 265 (1899).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We naturally ask why the Decree apparently fell so quickly into abeyance, and why it did not hold good over a wider area, since in writing to Corinth and Rome St. Paul never refers to it. But, to say nothing of the principle laid down in the reading of Codex [292] (see above on p. 323), St. Paul’s language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
