They had proclaimed salvation through faith in Christ. Their converts were now told that they had been teaching a soul-destroying falsehood.<p><span class= "bld">No small dissension and disputation.</span>—The first of the two words was that which had been used by classical writers, like Thucydides (iii. 82) and Aristotle (<span class= "ital">Polit.</span> v. 2), to express the greatest evil of all political societies—the spirit of party and of faction. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-7.htm" title="And there was one named Barabbas, which lay bound with them that had made insurrection with him, who had committed murder in the insurrection.">Mark 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-19.htm" title="(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)">Luke 23:19</a>, it is used of the “insurrection” in which Barabbas had been the ringleader. That element of evil was now beginning to show itself in the Christian Church.<p><span class= "bld">They determined that Paul and Barnabas.</span>—These were naturally chosen as the representatives of the cause of which they had been the chief advocates. The “certain others” are not named, but the prophets of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>, and the men of Cyprus and Cyrene of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-20.htm" title="And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, which, when they were come to Antioch, spoke to the Grecians, preaching the LORD Jesus.">Acts 11:20</a>, were likely enough to have been chosen, and Titus was apparently taken up as an example of the fruits of St. Paul’s labours (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-3.htm" title="Grace be to you and peace from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ,">Galatians 1:3</a>). Looking to the Roman name which this disciple bore, it is not unlikely that he may have been among the first to whom the term <span class= "ital">Christian</span> was applied. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-26.htm" title="And when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.">Acts 11:26</a>.) The fulness with which the history of the Council is given, suggests the possibility that St. Luke himself may have been present at it. If not, he must have based his report on materials supplied by St. Paul or one of the other delegates from Antioch, possibly Manaen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-1.htm" title="Now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers; as Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, which had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.">Acts 13:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders.</span>—The circumstances of the journey make it all but certain that we may identify it with that of which St. Paul speaks in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a>. The only other visits that can dispute its claim are those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-22.htm" title="And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.">Acts 18:22</a>; but though the latter view has been taken by some able writers (<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>Lewin’s <span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>i., p. 302), there are, it is believed, decisive grounds for rejecting both. Against the first there are the facts, (1) that it is not easy to place fourteen years between the visit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-27.htm" title="But Barnabas took him, and brought him to the apostles, and declared to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.">Acts 9:27</a>, and that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>; (2) the visit of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a> appears in the history as confined to the single object of carrying relief to the suffering poor of the Church at Jerusalem; (3) the question as to enforcing circumcision had not then been raised, after its apparent settlement in the case of Cornelius; (4) had the agreement referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a> preceded the Council, it would assuredly have been appealed to in the course of the debate at the Council. Against the second there are the facts (1) that the interval would, in that case, have been more than fourteen years; and (2) that it was not likely that the question should have been raised again after the decision of the Council. The only arguments of any weight on the other side are, (1) that the narrative of Acts 15 makes no mention of Titus; and (2) that that of Galatians 2 makes no mention of the Council; but these arguments from omission tell equally against both the other visits. These points will be dealt with as we proceed, and are, in any case, not sufficient to outweigh the evidence in the other scale. The reference of the question to the “Apostles and elders” is in many ways important. (1) As against the dogmatic system of the Church of Rome. On her theory, in its latest forms, the reference should have been to Peter, and to Peter alone, as the unerring guide of the Church into all truth. (2) As a recognition of the authority of the mother-Church of Jerusalem by the daughter-Church of Antioch; and as a precedent for referring local disputes to the decision of a central authority. (3) As showing the confidence which Paul and Barnabas felt that the decision would be in their favour. They could not believe that St. Peter would be false to the lesson which the history of Cornelius had taught him, nor that St. James would recall the definition which he had so recently given of “pure and undefiled religion” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">James 1:27</a>). (4) We note that St. Paul ascribes the journey to a “revelation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm" title="Then fourteen years after I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, and took Titus with me also.">Galatians 2:1</a>). The thought came into his mind as by an inspiration that this, and not prolonged wranglings at Antioch, was the right solution of the problem.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-6 Some from Judea taught the Gentile converts at Antioch, that they could not be saved, unless they observed the whole ceremonial law as given by Moses; and thus they sought to destroy Christian liberty. There is a strange proneness in us to think that all do wrong who do not just as we do. Their doctrine was very discouraging. Wise and good men desire to avoid contests and disputes as far as they can; yet when false teachers oppose the main truths of the gospel, or bring in hurtful doctrines, we must not decline to oppose them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had no small dissension an disputation - The word rendered "dissension" &#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  stasis denotes sometimes "sedition" or "intestine war," and sometimes "earnest and violent disputation or controversy," <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/23-7.htm">Acts 23:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm">Acts 23:10</a>. In this place it clearly denotes that there was earnest and warm discussion; but it is not implied that there was any improper heat or temper on the part of Paul and Barnabas. Important principles were to be settled in regard to the organization of the church. Doctrines were advanced by the Judaizing teachers which were false, and which tended to produce great disorder in the church. Those doctrines were urged with zeal, were declared to be essential to salvation, and would therefore tend to distract the minds of Christians, and to produce great anxiety. It became, therefore, necessary to meet them with a determined purpose, and to establish the truth on an immovable basis. And the case shows that it is right to "contend earnestly for the faith" Jde 1:3; and, when similar cases occur, that it is proper to resist the approach of error with all the arguments which may be at our command, and with all the weapons which truth can furnish. It is further implied here that it is the duty of the ministers of the gospel to defend the truth and to oppose error. Paul and Barnabas regarded themselves as set for this purpose (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm">Philippians 1:17</a>, "Knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel"); and Christian ministers should be qualified to defend the truth, and should be willing with a proper spirit and with great earnestness to maintain the doctrines revealed.<p>They determined - There was no prospect that the controversy would be settled by contention and argument. It would seem, from this statement, that those who came down from Judea were also willing that the whole matter should be referred to the apostles at Jerusalem. The reason for this may have been:<p>(1) That Jerusalem would be regarded by them as the source of authority in the Christian church, as it had been among the Jews.<p>(2) most of the apostles and the most experienced Christians were there. They had listened to the instructions of Christ himself; had been long in the church; and were supposed to be better acquainted with its design and its laws.<p>(3) those who came from Judea would not be likely to acknowledge the authority of Paul as an apostle: the authority of those at Jerusalem they would recognize.<p>(4) they might have had a very confident expectation that the decision there would be in their favor. The question had not been agitated there. They had all been Jews, and it is certain that they continued as yet to attend in the temple service, and to conform to the Jewish customs. They might have expected, therefore, with great confidence, that the decision would be in their favor, and they were willing to refer it to those who resided at Jerusalem.<p>Certain other of them - Of the brethren; probably of each party. They did not go to debate, or to give their opinion, or to vote in the ease themselves, but to lay the question fairly before the apostles and elders.<p>Unto the apostles - The authority of the apostles in such a case would be acknowledged by all. They had been immediately instructed by the Saviour, and had the promise of infallible guidance in the organization of the church. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-19.htm">Matthew 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18</a>.<p>And elders - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. Greek: presbyters. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>. Who these were, or what was their office and authority, is not easy now to determine. It may refer either to the aged men in the church at Jerusalem, or to those who were appointed to rule and to preach in connection with the apostles. As in the synagogue it was customary to determine questions by the advice of a bench of elders, there is no improbability in the supposition that the apostles would imitate that custom, and appoint a similar arrangement in the Christian church (Grotius). It is generally agreed that this is the journey to which Paul refers in <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1-10</a>. If so, it happened fourteen years after his conversion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>. It was done in accordance with the divine command, "by revelation," <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm">Galatians 2:2</a>. Among those who went with him was Titus, who was afterward so much distinguished as his companion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-3.htm">Galatians 2:3</a>.<p>About this question - The question whether the ceremonial laws of Moses were binding on Christian converts. In regard to the nature and design of this council at Jerusalem, see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/15-30.htm">Acts 15:30-31</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

And the church of Jerusalem being the most ancient church, and several of the apostles residing here, who had seen Christ in the flesh, and had received their mission and commission from him, and had been extraordinarily endowed with the Holy Ghost;

The rest might have contended that those two ought not to be the deputies to Jerusalem, but that others, whose judgment was more unbiassed, should be deputed. But on both sides all things are done in a moderate and candid spirit. It was an easier thing to make a Christian of a Gentile, than to overcome Pharisaic false teaching.—<span class="greekheb">καί τινας</span>, <span class="ital">and certain persons</span>) It is a joyful thing to have associates both in the faith and in one’s journeying.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἀποστόλους καὶ πρεσβυτέρους</span>, <span class="ital">the apostles and presbyters</span> [<span class="ital">elders</span>]) The order of apostles therefore was distinct from that of the presbyters or elders. Hebr. <span class="greekheb">זקנים</span>, elders.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - And <span class="accented">when</span> for <span class="accented">when therefore</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">questioning</span> for <span class="accented">disputation</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">the brethren</span> (in italics) <span class="accented">appointed</span> for <span class="accented">they determined</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Certain other of them</span>. One of these would be Titus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>). The circumstance that, on this occasion, St. Paul did go up to those who were apostles before him, to consult with them on a matter of doctrine, shows at once why he refers so pointedly to this visit in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>, etc., and is almost conclusive evidence that this visit is the one there referred to. The companionship of Barnabas; the agreement of the expression, "I went up by revelation," with the fact that he was sent by the Church, doubtless in obedience to some voice of the Spirit, like that mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-2.htm">Acts 13:2</a>; the occasion, a dispute about the circumcision of Gentile converts; the line taken by Paul and Barnabas in declaring the conversion of the Gentiles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-4.htm">Acts 15:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2.htm">Galatians 2</a>:27), and the result (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-19.htm">Acts 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-5.htm">Galatians 2:5, 7, 9</a>), are all strong, not to say conclusive, marks of the identity of the two visits. <span class="cmt_word">The apostles and elders</span>. This phrase marks the constitution of the governing part of the Church of Jerusalem. The addition in vers. 22 and 23 of "the whole Church," and (according to the T.R.) of "the brethren," shows the part the body of the believers had in approving and sanctioning the decisions of the elders. The transaction marks the position of the Church of Jerusalem as the metropolitan Church of Christendom. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/15.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Question (&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>Found only in the Acts, and always of a question in dispute. </body></html>
