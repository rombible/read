It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A space - For some time.<p>They were let go in peace - An expression implying that they departed with the affectionate regard of the Christians to whom they had ministered, and with their highest wishes for their prosperity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-11.htm">1 Corinthians 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-10.htm">2 John 1:10</a>.<p>Unto the apostles - At Jerusalem.
