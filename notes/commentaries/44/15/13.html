No one speaks after him; he sum up the whole debate; he proposes the decree which is to be submitted to the Council for approval.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:7-21 We see from the words purifying their hearts by faith, and the address of St. Peter, that justification by faith, and sanctification by the Holy Ghost, cannot be separated; and that both are the gift of God. We have great cause to bless God that we have heard the gospel. May we have that faith which the great Searcher of hearts approves, and attests by the seal of the Holy Spirit. Then our hearts and consciences will be purified from the guilt of sin, and we shall be freed from the burdens some try to lay upon the disciples of Christ. Paul and Barnabas showed by plain matters of fact, that God owned the preaching of the pure gospel to the Gentiles without the law of Moses; therefore to press that law upon them, was to undo what God had done. The opinion of James was, that the Gentile converts ought not to be troubled about Jewish rites, but that they should abstain from meats offered to idols, so that they might show their hatred of idolatry. Also, that they should be cautioned against fornication, which was not abhorred by the Gentiles as it should be, and even formed a part of some of their rites. They were counselled to abstain from things strangled, and from eating blood; this was forbidden by the law of Moses, and also here, from reverence to the blood of the sacrifices, which being then still offered, it would needlessly grieve the Jewish converts, and further prejudice the unconverted Jews. But as the reason has long ceased, we are left free in this, as in the like matters. Let converts be warned to avoid all appearances of the evils which they formerly practised, or are likely to be tempted to; and caution them to use Christian liberty with moderation and prudence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>James answered - James the Less, son of Alpheus.

James had an authority not less than that of Peter. It is possible that he might have been next in age (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-7.htm">1 Corinthians 15:7</a>); and it seems morally certain that he remained for a considerable part of his life in Jerusalem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-17.htm">Acts 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-18.htm">Acts 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-19.htm">Galatians 1:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm">Galatians 2:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-12.htm">Galatians 2:12</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13.

His decision, though given as his own judgment only, could not be of great weight with the opposing party, from his conservative reverence for all Jewish usages within the circle of Israelitish Christianity.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">After they had held their peace; </span> Barnabas and Paul had finished their narrative. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">James, </span> who was surnamed the Just, and was the son of Alpheus, and a kinsman to our Saviour, now being president of this council. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answered; </span> that is, began to speak. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And after they had held their peace,....
