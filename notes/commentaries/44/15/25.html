It was a comfort to hear that carnal ordinances were no longer imposed on them, which perplexed the conscience, but could not purify or pacify it; and that those who troubled their minds were silenced, so that the peace of the church was restored, and that which threatened division was removed. All this was consolation for which they blessed God. Many others were at Antioch. Where many labour in the word and doctrine, yet there may be opportunity for us: the zeal and usefulness of others should stir us up, not lay us asleep.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch - Since we have heard.<p>That certain - That some, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-1.htm">Acts 15:1</a>.<p>Have troubled you with words - With doctrines.

It properly means "to collect together the vessels used in a house the household furniture - for the purpose of removing it." It is applied to marauders, robbers, and enemies who remove and bear off property, thus producing distress, confusion, and disorder. It is thus used in the sense of disturbing or destroying, and here denotes that they "unsettled their minds" - that they produced anxiety, disturbance, and distress by these doctrines about Moses.<p>To whom we gave no such commandment - They went, therefore, without authority. Self-constituted and self-sent teachers not infrequently produce disturbance and distress. Had the apostles been consulted on this subject, the difficulty would have been avoided. By thus saying that they had not given them a command to teach these things, they practically assured the Gentile converts that they did not approve of the course which those who went from Judea had taken. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. our beloved Barnabas and Paul&#8212;Barnabas is put first here, and in Ac 15:12, on account of his former superior position in the church at Jerusalem (see Ac 9:27; 11:22)&#8212;an evidence this that we have the document precisely as written, as also of the credibility of this precious history.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With one accord; </span> with one mind, as if they had all but one soul, (they had but one Spirit, the Spirit of truth), as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-12.htm" title="And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders worked among the people; (and they were all with one accord in Solomon's porch.">Acts 5:12</a></span>; their unanimity adding great strength to the decree they sent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord,....
