The scene was the theatre at Cæsarea, which had been built by Herod the Great. Agrippa was celebrating games in honour of the Emperor Claudius, who had succeeded Caligula in A.D. 41, possibly in honour of his return from Britain in A.D. 44. He was arrayed in a robe of silver tissue, such as Caligula had been wont to wear at banquets and games in Rome, which glittered with a dazzling brightness under the rays of the morning sun. His courtiers, taking up the Roman fashion of showing honour to kings and emperors, hailed him as a god, and prayed him, as such, to be propitious to them. The king did not repress the flattery, which fell on the ears of all Jewish by-standers as a fearful blasphemy. He accepted for himself the divine honours which he had dissuaded Caligula from claiming. He looked up, and saw an owl perched on a rope behind him, and recognised in it an omen of evil, fulfilling a prediction which had been made to him by a fellow-prisoner during his confinement at Rome (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 8). Sharp pain fell on him, and in five days he died.<p>Comparing St. Luke’s narrative with this, it seems probable that the delegates from Tyre and Sidon were among those who raised the cry, “Be thou propitious to us,” and that their friend Blastus, knowing the weak point in Herod’s character, had instructed them that this was the way to obtain his favour. We feel, as we read the narrative, the contrast between St. Peter’s refusal even of Cornelius’s attitude of homage, and Agrippa’s acceptance of the profane apotheosis of the multitude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/12-21.htm" title="And on a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat on his throne, and made an oration to them....">Acts 12:21-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">And upon a set day </span>— When shows and games were exhibited by him in honour of Claudius Cesar; <span class="ital">Herod, arrayed in royal apparel — </span>In a garment so wrought with silver, that the rays of the rising sun, striking upon, and reflected from it, dazzled the eyes of the beholders; <span class="ital">sat upon his throne </span>— In a public theatre; <span class="ital">and made an oration unto them</span> — Not to the Tyrian and Sidonian deputies merely, but unto all the people assembled on this grand occasion. <span class="ital">And the people gave a shout, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man </span>— Such profane flattery the heathen frequently paid to princes. But the commonness of a wicked custom rather increases than lessens the guilt of it. And the unhappy king, instead of expressing a just indignation at such base and impious adulation, hearkened to it with a secret pleasure. <span class="ital">And immediately — </span>For frequently God does not delay to vindicate his injured honour; an <span class="ital">angel of the Lord smote him</span> — Of this, other historians say nothing; so wide a difference there is between divine and human history! An angel of the Lord brought out Peter, an angel smote Herod. Men did not see the instruments in either case: these were only known to the people of God. <span class="ital">Because he gave not God the glory </span>— Did not reject these blasphemous applauses, but willingly received them, and thus filled up the measure of his iniquities. So then vengeance tarried not. <span class="ital">And he was eaten of worms </span>— Or vermin, which bred in his bowels, and rendered him a most loathsome and horrible spectacle to all about him; <span class="ital">and </span>he <span class="ital">gave up the ghost </span>— Expired in agony and infamy, (as his grandfather, Herod the Great, had done, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-19.htm" title="But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appears in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,">Matthew 2:19</a>,) and sunk as much below the common state of human nature, as his flatterers endeavoured to raise him above it! The Jewish historian, Josephus, confirms St. Luke’s account of the end of this miserable man. He tells us, that “as he did not rebuke the impious flattery addressed to him, he was immediately seized with exquisite and racking tortures in his bowels, so that he was compelled, before he left the place, to own his folly in admitting such acclamations, and upbraided those about him with the wretched condition in which they then saw their god; and being carried out of the assembly to his palace, he expired in violent agonies, the fifth day after he was taken, in the fifty-fourth year of his age, and the seventh of his reign.” <span class="ital">Antiq., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-7.htm" title="And all the men were about twelve.">Acts 19:7</a></span>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:20-25 Many heathen princes claimed and received Divine honours, but it was far more horrible impiety in Herod, who knew the word and worship of the living God, to accept such idolatrous honours without rebuking the blasphemy. And such men as Herod, when puffed with pride and vanity, are ripening fast for signal vengeance. God is very jealous for his own honour, and will be glorified upon those whom he is not glorified by. See what vile bodies we carry about with us; they have in them the seeds of their own dissolution, by which they will soon be destroyed, whenever God does but speak the word. We may learn wisdom from the people of Tyre and Sidon, for we have offended the Lord with our sins. We depend on him for life, and breath, and all things; it surely then behoves us to humble ourselves before him, that through the appointed Mediator, who is ever ready to befriend us, we may be reconciled to him, lest wrath come upon us to the utmost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And upon a set day - An appointed, public day. This was the second day of the sports and games which Herod celebrated in Caesarea in honor of Claudius Caesar. Josephus has given an account of this occurrence, which coincides remarkably with the narrative here. The account is contained in his "Antiquities of the Jews," book 19, chapter 8, section 2, and is as follows: "Now when Agrippa had reigned three years over all Judea, he came to the city Caesarea, which was formerly called Strato's Tower; and there he exhibited shows in honor of Caesar, upon his being informed that there was a certain festival celebrated to make vows for his safety. At which festival a great multitude was gotten together of the principal persons, and such as were of dignity throughout his province. On the second day of which shows he put on a garment made wholly of silver," etc.<p>Arrayed in royal apparel - In the apparel of a king. Josephus thus describes the dress which Herod wore on that occasion. "He put on a garment made wholly of silver, and of wonderful contexture, and early in the morning came into the theater place of the shows and games, at which time the silver of his garment, being illuminated by the first reflection of the sun's rays upon it, shone after a surprising manner, and was so resplendent as to spread a horror over those that looked intently on him."<p>Sat upon his throne - This does not denote a throne in the usual sense of that word, but "a high seat" in the theater, where he sat, and from whence he could have a full view of the games and sports. From this place he made his speech.<p>Made an oration - Addressed the people.' What was the subject of this speech is not intimated by Luke or Josephus. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

This festival itself is not defined more exactly by Josephus than as held <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς σωτηρίας</span> of the emperor. Hence different hypotheses concerning it, such as that of Anger: that it celebrated the return of Claudius from Britain; and that of Wieseler: that it was the Quinquennalia, which, however, was not celebrated until August; a date which, according to the context (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>), is too late.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐδημηγόρει πρὸς αὐτούς</span>] <span class="ital">he made a speech in public assembly of the people</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-22.htm" title="And the people gave a shout, saying, It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.">Acts 12:22</a>) <span class="ital">to them</span>, namely, to the Tyrians and Sidonians, to whom (to whose representatives) he thus publicly before the people declared in a speech directed to them his decision on their request, his sentiments, etc. Only this simple view of <span class="greekheb">πρὸς αὐτούς</span>: <span class="ital">to them</span> (comp.

Having therefore turned his eyes towards his friends, ‘Behold,’ said he, ‘I the god, as you called me, am commanded to leave life, the fatal necessity of death confuting your lie; and I, whom ye hailed as immortal, am hurried away by a mortal stroke.’—Then worn out by the torture, which did not at all abate for five days in continuation, he ended life.”—<span class="greekheb">πρὸς αὐτοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">unto them</span>) It is probable that among his hearers were ambassadors of the Tyrians and Sidonians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> <span class="accented">- Arrayed himself</span> for <span class="accented">arrayed</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">and sat</span> for <span class="accented">sat</span>, A.V. and T.R.; <span class="accented">on the throne</span> for <span class="accented">upon his throne</span>, A.V.
