These Christians continued in prayer for Peter, for they were truly in earnest. Thus men ought always to pray, and not to faint. As long as we are kept waiting for a mercy, we must continue praying for it. But sometimes that which we most earnestly wish for, we are most backward to believe. The Christian law of self-denial and of suffering for Christ, has not done away the natural law of caring for our own safety by lawful means. In times of public danger, all believers have God for their hiding-place; which is so secret, that the world cannot find them. Also, the instruments of persecution are themselves exposed to danger; the wrath of God hangs over all that engage in this hateful work. And the range of persecutors often vents itself on all in its way.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he had considered ... - Thinking on the subject; considering what he should do in these circumstances.<p>He came to the house of Mary ... - Probably this house was near him; and he would naturally seek the dwelling of a Christian friend.<p>The mother of John ... - Probably this was the John Mark who wrote the gospel.

This relationship accounts for the way in which the uncle clung to his nephew, even when St Paul declined to have Mark as a companion on their second proposed missionary journey. We do not read of the father of Mark anywhere, so it is probable that Mary was a widow, and, like her brother, was possessed of means which enabled her to put a house, or a part thereof, at the service of the Church, as a meeting-place for prayer.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gathered together praying</span>] The Greek has “<span class="ital">and</span> praying.” The introduction of the conjunction seems to indicate not that this was a special or solitary occasion when the disciples were gathered at the house of Mary, but rather that this house was a place in which such gatherings were usual, and at the time when Peter was delivered such an assembly was there and making supplication (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-5.htm" title="Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the church to God for him.">Acts 12:5</a></span>) for his deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνιδὼν</span>, <span class="ital">having considered</span>) viz. what he ought to do.

If Paul and Barnabas were not in her house at the time (which there is no evidence that they were), it is likely that all the particulars of Peter's escape may have been communicated to Paul by John Mark, and by him repeated to Luke. That they went to the house of Mary before their return seems certain from their taking Mark with them to Antioch (ver. 25), possibly to deliver him from the danger Christians were in at Jerusalem at this time. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/12.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>When he had considered (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;)<p>The verb strictly means to see together, or at the same time.

Peter's mental condition is described by two expressions: First, he came to himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>), or, lit., when he had become present in himself; denoting his awaking from the dazed condition produced by his being suddenly roused from sleep and confronted with a supernatural appearance (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-9.htm">Acts 12:9</a>). Secondly, when he had become aware (&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;); denoting his taking in the situation, according to the popular phrase. I do not think that any of the commentators have sufficiently emphasized the force of &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;, together, as indicating his comprehensive perception of all the elements of the case. They all refer the word to his recognition of his deliverance from prison, which, however, has already been noted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-11.htm">Acts 12:11</a>. While it may include this, it refers also to all the circumstances of the case present at that moment. He had been freed; he was there in the street alone; he must go somewhere; there was the house of Mary, where he was sure to find friends. Having taken in all this, perceived it all, he went to the house of Mary.  </body></html>
