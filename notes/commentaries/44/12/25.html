And such men as Herod, when puffed with pride and vanity, are ripening fast for signal vengeance. God is very jealous for his own honour, and will be glorified upon those whom he is not glorified by. See what vile bodies we carry about with us; they have in them the seeds of their own dissolution, by which they will soon be destroyed, whenever God does but speak the word. We may learn wisdom from the people of Tyre and Sidon, for we have offended the Lord with our sins. We depend on him for life, and breath, and all things; it surely then behoves us to humble ourselves before him, that through the appointed Mediator, who is ever ready to befriend us, we may be reconciled to him, lest wrath come upon us to the utmost.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Returned from Jerusalem - They had gone to Jerusalem to carry alms, and they now returned to Antioch, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>.<p>When they had fulfilled their ministry - When they had accomplished the purpose for which they had been sent there; that is, to deposit the alms of the church at Antioch in the hands of the eiders of the churches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>.<p>John, whose surname was Mark - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm">Acts 12:12</a>. From this period the sacred historian records chiefly the labors of Paul. The labors of the other apostles are, after this, seldom referred to in this book, and the attention is fixed almost entirely on the trials and travels of the great apostle of the Gentiles. His important services, his unwearied efforts, his eminent success, and the fact that Luke was his companion, may be the reasons why his labors are made so prominent in the history. Through the previous chapters we have seen the church rise from small beginnings, until it was even now spreading into surrounding regions. We have seen it survive two persecutions, commenced and conducted with all the power and malice of Jewish rulers. We have seen the most zealous of the persecutors converted to the faith which he once destroyed, and the royal persecutor put to death by the divine judgment. And we have thus seen that God was the protector of the church; that no weapon formed against it could prosper; that, according to the promise of the Redeemer, the gates of hell could not prevail against it. In that God and Saviour who then defended the church, we may still confide, and may be assured that he who was then its friend has it still "engraved on the palms of his hands," and designs that it shall extend until it fills the earth with light and salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

The taking of <span class="greekheb">ὑπέστρεψαν</span> in the sense of the <span class="ital">pluperfect</span> (“jam ante Herodis obitum,” etc., Heinrichs, Kuinoel), rests on the erroneous assumption that the collection-journey of this passage coincides with Galatians 2. The course of events, according to the Book of Acts, is as follows:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While (<span class="greekheb">κατ</span> ̓ <span class="greekheb">ἐκεῖνον τὸν καιρόν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church.">Acts 12:1</a>) Barnabas and Saul are sent with the collection to <span class="ital">Judaea</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>), there occurs in <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span> the execution of James and the imprisonment and deliverance of Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/12-2.htm" title="And he killed James the brother of John with the sword....">Acts 12:2-18</a>), and then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-19.htm" title="And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death.

From this it follows that, according to the Acts, they visited first the other churches of Judaea and came to Jerusalem <span class="ital">last</span>; so that the episode, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/12-1.htm" title="Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth his hands to vex certain of the church....">Acts 12:1-23</a>, is to be assigned to that time which Barnabas and Saul on their journey in Judaea spent with the different churches, <span class="ital">before they came to Jerusalem</span>, from which, as from the termination of their journey, they returned to Antioch. Perhaps what Barnabas had heard on his journey among the country-churches of Judaea as to the persecution of the Christians by Agrippa, and as to what befell James and Peter, induced him (in regard to Paul, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm" title="Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.">Acts 11:30</a>) not to resort to the capital, until he had heard of the departure and perhaps also of the death of the king.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συμπαραλαβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] from Jerusalem; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-12.htm" title="And when he had considered the thing, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying.">Acts 12:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/12.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-25.htm" title="And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had fulfilled their ministry, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.">Acts 12:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπέστρεψαν ἐξ Ἱ</span>., see critical notes, and Ramsay, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, pp. 63, 64, and note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance;">Acts 22:17</a>, below.—<span class="greekheb">πληρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν διακ</span>.; if the visit extended over as long a period as Ramsay believes, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, from the time when the failure of harvest in 46 turned scarcity into famine until the beginning of 47 (<span class="ital">u. s.</span>, pp. 51, 63), no doubt the delegates could not have simply delivered a sum of money to the elders, but would have administered the relief (not money), and carried a personal message of cheer to the distressed (Ramsay, p. 49 ff., <span class="ital">u. s.</span>), and so have “fulfilled” their ministry.

The fact here stated of their taking John Mark with them, is very interesting in connection with ver. 12. Whether or no Saul and Barnabas were in the house of Mary at the time of Peter's deliverance from prison, they evidently went there shortly before or shortly after. As regards the sequence of events related in this chapter, it is by no means necessary to suppose that Barnabas and Saul did not leave Jerusalem till after the death of Agrippa. Luke, connecting the death of Agrippa with his murder of James and his intended murder of Peter, as Eusebius and Chrysostom and others rightly say, would naturally follow up the narrative of the persecution by the narrative of the persecutor's awful death; and then go on to relate the return of the two apostles to Antioch in continuation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-30.htm">Acts 11:30</a>. We have no means of deciding whether, in point of fact, they returned before or after Agrippa's death. It seems most probable that they returned before, as, under the circumstances, they would not tarry at Jerusalem longer than was necessary for the fulfillment of their ministration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
