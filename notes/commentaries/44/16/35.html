Paul does not always plead this privilege of being a Roman; but in a country where they were entire strangers, such treatment, if suffered without animadversion, might have brought upon them a suspicion of their having been guilty of some uncommon crime; and so have hindered the success of the gospel. Now when the pretors <span class="ital">heard that they were Romans, </span>they were afraid of being called to an account for their conduct toward them, well knowing that even to have torn the garments of a citizen, and much more to have scourged him, especially thus publicly, and without hearing his defence, was a crime which might have exposed them to very high penalties, if the person injured had entered a complaint against them in the legal forms. <span class="ital">They came </span>— Therefore, in their own persons, to the prison where Paul and Silas were, <span class="ital">and besought them </span>— Not to resent the injury that had been done them, or, as the word <span class="greekheb">παρεκαλεσαν</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">besought, </span>is rendered in the next verse, <span class="ital">they comforted them, </span>namely, by acknowledging their innocence, and commending the patience and fortitude with which they had borne the punishment so rashly inflicted upon them, as well as by other kind and conciliating speeches. <span class="ital">And brought them out </span>— With the most respectful treatment; <span class="ital">and desired them to depart out of the city </span>— With all convenient speed, to prevent any of those popular tumults which might be the consequence of their longer abode in it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:35-40 Paul, though willing to suffer for the cause of Christ, and without any desire to avenge himself, did not choose to depart under the charge of having deserved wrongful punishment, and therefore required to be dismissed in an honourable manner. It was not a mere point of honour that the apostle stood upon, but justice, and not to himself so much as to his cause. And when proper apology is made, Christians should never express personal anger, nor insist too strictly upon personal amends. The Lord will make them more than conquerors in every conflict; instead of being cast down by their sufferings, they will become comforters of their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when it was day ... - It is evident from the narrative that it was not contemplated at first to release them so soon, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm">Acts 16:22-24</a>. But it is not known what produced this change of purpose in the magistrates. It is probable, however, that they had been brought to reflection, somewhat as the jailor had, by the earthquake, and that their consciences had been troubled by the fact, that in order to please the multitude, they had caused strangers to be beaten and imprisoned without trial and contrary to the Roman laws. An earthquake is always suited to alarm the guilty; and among the Romans it was regarded as an omen of the anger of the gods, and was therefore adapted to produce agitation and remorse. The agitation and alarm of the magistrates were shown by the fact that they sent the officers as soon as it was day. The judgments of God are eminently suited to alarm sinners. Two ancient mss. read this, "The magistrates who were alarmed by the earthquake, sent, etc." (Doddridge). Whether this reading be genuine or not, it doubtless expresses the true cause of their sending to release the apostles.<p>The serjeants - &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  rabdouchous. Literally, those having rods; the lictors. These were public officers who walked before magistrates with the emblems of authority. In Rome they bore before the senators the fasces; that is, a bundle of rods with an axe in its center, as a symbol of office. They performed somewhat the same office as a beadle in England, or as a constable in our courts (America). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>35, 36. when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go&#8212;The cause of this change can only be conjectured. When the commotion ceased, reflection would soon convince them of the injustice they had done, even supposing the prisoners had been entitled to no special privileges; and if rumor reached them that the prisoners were somehow under supernatural protection, they might be the more awed into a desire to get rid of them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The serjeants; </span> their messengers, or officers, which did carry a mace, or a rod, from whence they had their name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saying, Let those men go; </span> probably being terrified with the earthquake, which if it had not been general, they could not yet have heard of. Their consciences might also accuse them for having unjustly punished them for a good deed which they had done, only to gratify the rage of the multitude; as also because they had acted against the custom of the Romans, (though they did not yet know that they had the privilege of Roman citizens), and had beaten strangers without any legal trial, or form of law. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when it was day,.... In one copy Beza says, these words are added, <p>"the magistrates came together in one place in the court, and remembering the earthquake that was made, they were afraid, and sent the sergeants;'' <p>but they seem to be no other than a gloss, which crept into the text; however, it seems reasonable to suppose, that in the morning the magistrates met together, to consider what was further to be done with Paul and Silas; when upon cooler thoughts, they judged it best to be content with what punishment they had inflicted on them, and dismiss them; and if they had felt anything of the earthquake, or had heard of it in the prison, and of the converts that had been made there, they might be the more induced to let them go: <p>the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, let these men go; the Arabic version reads, "these two men"; that is, Paul and Silas: who these sergeants were, is not very certain; they seem to be so called in the Greek language, from their carrying rods, or little staves in their hands, and were a sort of apparitors; by these the magistrates sent orders, either by word of mouth, or in writing, to the jailer, to let Paul and Silas out of prison, and set them at liberty, to go where they would; the same power that shook the foundations of the prison, and loosed the bands of the prisoners, wrought upon the hearts of the magistrates, to let the apostles go free. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{19}</span> And when it was day, the magistrates sent the serjeants, saying, Let those men go.</span><p>(19) Shame and confusion is in due time the reward of wicked and unjust magistrates.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-35.htm" title="And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go....">Acts 16:35-36</a>. The news of the miraculous earthquake, perhaps also the particulars which they might in the meantime have learned concerning the two prisoners, may have made the praetors have scruples concerning the hasty maltreatment. They consider it advisable to have nothing further to do with them, and to get rid of them forthwith by releasing them. Curtly and contemptuously (<span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἀνθρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνους</span>), in order to maintain at least thereby their stern official attitude, they notified the order by their lictors (<span class="greekheb">ῥαβδούχους</span>, bearers of the <span class="ital">fasces</span>) to the jailor, who, with congratulatory sympathy, announces it to the prisoners. According to Baumgarten, the motives for the severity of the previous day had lost their force with the praetors during the night,—a point in which there is expressed a distinction from the persistent enmity of the Sanhedrists in Jerusalem. But this would not furnish an adequate ground for a proceeding running so entirely counter to the course of criminal procedure. The praetors must have become haunted by apprehension and ill at ease, and they must therefore have received some sort of information concerning the miraculous occurrences.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνῃ</span>] <span class="ital">happily</span>.
