The statement that “her household” were baptised has often been urged as evidence that infant baptism was the practice of the apostolic age. It must be admitted, however, that this is to read a great deal between the lines, and the utmost that can be said is that the language of the writer does not exclude infants. The practice itself rests on firmer grounds than a precarious induction from a few ambiguous passages. (See Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.">Matthew 19:13-15</a>.) In this instance, moreover, there is no evidence that she had children, or even that she was married. The “household” may well have consisted of female slaves and freed-women whom she employed, and who made up her <span class= "ital">familia.</span> It follows, almost as a necessary inference, that many of these also were previously proselytes. For such as these, Judaism had been a “schoolmaster,” leading them to Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm" title="Why the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.">Galatians 3:24</a>.) We may think of Euodias and Syntyche, and the other women who “laboured in the gospel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2-3</a>), as having been, probably, among them. The names of the first two occur frequently in the inscriptions of the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> of this period, now in the Vatican and Lateran Museums, the Borghese Gardens, and elsewhere, as belonging to women of the slave or <span class= "ital">libertinæ</span> class.<p><span class= "bld">She besought us.</span>—Up to this time the teachers, four in number, had been, we must believe, living in a lodging and maintaining themselves, as usual, by labour—St. Paul as a tentmaker, St. Luke, probably, as a physician. Now the large-hearted hospitality of Lydia (the offer implies a certain measure of wealth, as, indeed, did her occupation, which required a considerable capital) led her to receive them as her guests. They did not readily abandon the independent position which their former practice secured them, and only yield to the kind “constraint” to which they were exposed.<p><span class= "bld">If ye have judged.</span>—The words contain a modest, almost a pathetic, appeal to the fact that the preachers had recognised her faith by admitting her to baptism. If she was fit for that, was she unfit to be their hostess?<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:6-15 The removals of ministers, and the dispensing the means of grace by them, are in particular under Divine conduct and direction. We must follow Providence: and whatever we seek to do, if that suffer us not, we ought to submit and believe to be for the best. People greatly need help for their souls, it is their duty to look out for it, and to invite those among them who can help them. And God's calls must be complied with readily. A solemn assembly the worshippers of God must have, if possible, upon the sabbath day. If we have not synagogues, we must be thankful for more private places, and resort to them; not forsaking the assembling together, as our opportunities are. Among the hearers of Paul was a woman, named Lydia. She had an honest calling, which the historian notices to her praise. Yet though she had a calling to mind, she found time to improve advantages for her soul. It will not excuse us from religious duties, to say, We have a trade to mind; for have not we also a God to serve, and souls to look after? Religion does not call us from our business in the world, but directs us in it. Pride, prejudice, and sin shut out the truths of God, till his grace makes way for them into the understanding and affections; and the Lord alone can open the heart to receive and believe his word. We must believe in Jesus Christ; there is no coming to God as a Father, but by the Son as Mediator.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when she was baptized - Apparently without any delay.

No mention is made of their having believed, and the case is one that affords a strong presumptive proof that this was an instance of household or infant baptism. Because:<p>(1) Her believing is particularly mentioned.<p>(2) it is not intimated that they believed.<p>(3) it is manifestly implied that they were baptized because she believed. It was the offering of her family to the Lord. It is just such an account as would now be given of a household or family that were baptized upon the faith of the parent.<p>If ye have judged me to be faithful - If you deem me a Christian or a believer.<p>And she constrained us - She urged us.

And when &#8230; baptized &#8230; and her household&#8212;probably without much delay. The mention of baptism here for the first time in connection with the labors of Paul, while it was doubtless performed on all his former converts, indicates a special importance in this first European baptism. Here also is the first mention of a Christian household. Whether it included children, also in that case baptized, is not explicitly stated; but the presumption, as in other cases of household baptism, is that it did. Yet the question of infant baptism must be determined on other grounds; and such incidental allusions form only part of the historical materials for ascertaining the practice of the Church.<p>she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord&#8212;the Lord Jesus; that is, "By the faith on Him which ye have recognized in me by baptism." There is a beautiful modesty in the expression.<p>And she constrained us&#8212;The word seems to imply that they were reluctant, but were overborne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And her household; </span> when Lydia had right to baptism, by reason of her faith in Jesus Christ, all her family, whom she could undertake to bring up in the knowledge of Christ, were admitted to that ordinance also; as all the servants, and such others as were born in his house, or bought with his money, were circumcised with Abraham, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm" title="And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.">Genesis 17:12</a>,13</span>. Now the gospel does not contract in any respect, but enlarges, the privileges of believers in all things. And if they might under the law have their children and servants admitted into a covenant with God, (which could not but rejoice religious parents and masters, who value the relation they and theirs have to God, above all earthly things), surely under the gospel none of our families are excluded, unless they wilfully exclude themselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">She constrained us; </span> as the two disciples that were going to Emmaus constrained our Saviour, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-29.htm" title="But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent.

See also Lange, <span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt</span>. II. p. 504 ff. But on this question the following remarks are to be made: (1) If, in the Jewish and Gentile families which were converted to Christ, there were children, their baptism is to be assumed in <span class="ital">those cases</span>, when they were so far advanced that they could and did confess their faith on Jesus as the Messiah; for this was the universal, absolutely necessary qualification for the reception of baptism; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-31.htm" title="And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house....">Acts 16:31-33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm" title="And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.">Acts 18:8</a>. (2) If, on the other hand, there were children still incapable of confessing, baptism could not be administered to those to whom that, which was the necessary presupposition of baptism for Christian sanctification, was still wanting. (3) Such young children, whose parents were Christians, rather fell under the point of view of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-14.htm" title="For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy.">1 Corinthians 7:14</a>, according to which, in conformity with the view of the apostolic church, the children of Christians were no longer regarded as <span class="greekheb">ἀκάθαρτοι</span>, but as <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span>, and that not on the footing of having received the character of holiness by baptism, but as having part in the Christian <span class="greekheb">ἁγιότης</span> by their fellowship with their Christian parents. See on 1 Cor. <span class="ital">l.c</span>. Besides, the circumcision of children must have been retained for a considerable time among the Jewish-Christians, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-21.htm" title="And they are informed of you, that you teach all the Jews which are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise their children, neither to walk after the customs.">Acts 21:21</a>. Therefore (4) the baptism of the children of <span class="ital">Christians</span>, of which no trace is found in the N.T. (not even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-1.htm" title="Children, obey your parents in the Lord: for this is right.">Ephesians 6:1</a>, in opposition to Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 192), is not to be held as an apostolic ordinance (Origen, <span class="ital">in ep. ad Rom</span>. lib. v.: “Ab apostolis <span class="ital">traditione</span> accepit ecclesia”), as, indeed, it encountered early and long resistance; but it is an <span class="ital">institution of the church</span>,[54] which gradually arose in post-apostolic times in connection with the development of ecclesiastical life (comp. Ehrenfeuchter, <span class="ital">prakt. Theol</span>. I. p. 82 f.) and of doctrinal teaching, not certainly attested before Tertullian, and by him still decidedly opposed, and, although already defended by Cyprian, only becoming general after the time of Augustine in virtue of that connection. Yet, even apart from the ecclesiastical premiss of a stern doctrine of original sin and of the devil going beyond Scripture, from which even exorcism arose, the continued <span class="ital">maintenance</span> of infant baptism, as the objective attribution of spiritually creative grace in virtue of the plan of salvation established for every individual in the fellowship of the church, is so much the more justified, as this objective <span class="ital">attribution</span> takes place with a view to the future subjective <span class="ital">appropriation</span>. And this subjective appropriation has so necessarily to emerge with the development of self-consciousness and of knowledge through faith, that in default thereof the church would have to recognise in the baptized no true members, but only <span class="ital">membra mortua</span>. This relation of connection with creative grace, in so far as the church is its sphere of operation, is a theme which, in presence of the attacks of Baptists and Rationalists, must overstep[55] the domain of exegesis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-14.htm" title="Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.">Matthew 18:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-13.htm" title="And they brought young children to him, that he should touch them: and his disciples rebuked those that brought them.">Mark 10:13</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-6.htm" title="That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.">John 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-3.htm" title="Know you not, that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death?">Romans 6:3</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-12.htm" title=" Buried with him in baptism, wherein also you are risen with him through the faith of the operation of God, who has raised him from the dead.">Colossians 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm" title="Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;">Titus 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-21.htm" title="The like figure whereunto even baptism does also now save us (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection of Jesus Christ:">1 Peter 3:21</a>[56]), and be worked out in that of dogmatics, yet without the addition of confirmation as any sort of supplement to baptism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἰ κεκρίκατε</span>] <span class="ital">if ye have judged</span>.
