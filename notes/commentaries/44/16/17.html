Here it will be enough to note the same symptom of a divided consciousness. We lose much of the human interest of the narrative if we merely think of a demon bearing, as in mockery, his witness to the work of Christ, in order that he might thwart that work. That continual cry spoke, we may well believe, of the girl’s mind as longing for deliverance, and peace, and calm. She sees in the preachers those whom she recognises as able to deliver her, as unlike as possible to the masters who traded on her maddened misery. And yet the thraldom in which she found herself led her to cries that simply impeded their work. We note, as characteristic, the recurrence of the name of the Most High God, which meets us from the lips of the demoniac in the Gospels. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-7.htm" title="And cried with a loud voice, and said, What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the most high God? I adjure you by God, that you torment me not.">Mark 5:7</a>.) As the name which was often in the mouths of exorcists, it became familiar to those who were regarded as subjects for their treatment. As she seems day by day to have gone to the river-side oratory, it is probable that she also had some points of contact with the faith of those who worshipped there, and had listened there to the preaching of the Apostles. Might not she claim a share in “the way of salvation” which was proclaimed to them?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation....">Acts 16:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">The same followed Paul and us — </span>Luke, Silas, and Timothy; <span class="ital">and cried, saying </span>— With great earnestness of voice and gesture; <span class="ital">These men are the servants of the most high God, </span>&c. — A great truth: but they did not need, nor would accept of, such testimony. <span class="ital">And this she did many </span>succeeding <span class="ital">days.

It may have been:<p>(1) That as she prophesied for gain, she supposed that Paul and Silas would reward her if she publicly proclaimed that they were the servants of God. Or,<p>(2) Because she was conscious that an evil spirit possessed her, and she feared that Paul and Silas would expel that spirit, and by proclaiming them to be the servants of God she hoped to conciliate their favor. Or,<p>(3) More probably it was because she saw evident tokens of their being sent from God, and that their doctrine would prevail; and by proclaiming this she hoped to acquire more authority, and a higher reputation for being herself inspired.

Silas, Luke, and Timothy; the Arabic version reads, "the same followed Paul and Silas"; as they were going to the oratory: <p>and cried, saying, these men are the servants of the most high God; not of Python, or Apollo, as she and her masters were; or of any of the deities of the Gentiles; nor of sin, nor of Satan, nor of men, but of the one only true and living God, one of whose titles is  "Elion", the "Most High", <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-22.htm">Genesis 14:22</a> and these men were his servants, not merely by right of creation, as all men are, or should be; nor only through the power of divine grace upon their souls, bringing them into a willing obedience to him, as all the saints are; but by office, being ministers of the word: wherefore it follows, <p>which show unto us the way of salvation; which is not by the works of men; for by them the justice of God cannot be satisfied, nor his law fulfilled; God has declared against this way of salvation; it would make void the death of Christ, and frustrate the design of God in it; which is to magnify his grace, and exclude boasting in man: to which may be added, that the best works of men being imperfect, and attended with much sin, would rather damn than save; wherefore it is sinful, dangerous, and vain, to attempt salvation in this way. The only way of salvation is by the Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the law is fulfilled, satisfaction is made for sin, peace and pardon are procured, an everlasting righteousness is brought in, and through whom grace and glory are given: and this is a way of salvation, agreeable to all the perfections of God; in which the vilest sinner made sensible of his sins, and of his need of this, has no reason to despair; it is exceeding suitable to his case, and is a way in which none ever perish, that are directed to it: and now this way of salvation is only shown in the Gospel, by the ministers of it; not by the light of nature, for to men who only have that, it is foolishness; nor by the law of Moses, for to such who are under that, it is a stumbling block; nor by the carnal reason of men, it is not of men, nor after men, but by divine revelation: and therefore the natural man receives it not, it is hid from such; and therefore they project various ways of salvation, which are pleasing in their own eyes, but the end of them are the ways of death; the way to life and immortality, is only brought to light in the Gospel: whether she said this of her own accord, or was obliged to it by divine impulse; and whether it was through fear of Paul, and in flattery to him, or was with a good or bad design, is not easy to determine: however, certain it is, what she said was truth; and sometimes the devil himself, the father of lies, is obliged to speak it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which shew unto us the way of salvation.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-17.htm" title="The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the most high God, which show to us the way of salvation....">Acts 16:17-18</a>. The soothsaying damsel, similar to a somnambulist,[57] reads in the souls of the apostle and his companions, and announces their characteristic dignity. But Paul, after he had first patiently let her alone for many days, sees in her exclamation a recognition on the part of the demon dwelling within her, as Jesus Himself met with recognition and homage from demons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-11.htm" title="And unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, You are the Son of God.">Mark 3:11</a>); and in order not to accept for himself and his work demoniacal testimony, which would not of itself be hushed, at length being painfully grieved (<span class="greekheb">διαπονηθείς</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm" title="Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.">Acts 4:2</a>), and turning to her as she followed him, he, in the name of Jesus Christ (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-7.htm" title="And when they had set them in the middle, they asked, By what power, or by what name, have you done this?">Acts 4:7</a>), commands the demon to come out of her. Now, as the slave considered Paul to be the servant of the <span class="ital">most high</span> God, who thus must have power over the god by whom she believed herself possessed, her fixed idea was at once destroyed by that command of power, and she was consequently restored from her overstrained state of mind to her former natural condition.
