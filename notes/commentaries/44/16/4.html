The decrees were clearly still regarded by the Gentile converts as being the charter on which they might take their stand in any dispute with the Judaisers, and doubtless helped to determine many who had previously hesitated, to seek admission into the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-4.htm" title="And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep, that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were at Jerusalem....">Acts 16:4-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">And </span>— In order that peace might be secured among the brethren in these parts, and no unnecessary burden might be imposed upon the Gentile converts, through the arts of any Judaizing teachers; as Paul and his companions <span class="ital">went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep </span>— Committed to the custody of each church an exact and attested copy of the decrees, made by the council at Jerusalem.

But when men will submit in nothing, and oblige in nothing, the first elements of the Christian temper seem to be wanting; and there is great reason to believe that the doctrines and precepts of the gospel will not be successfully taught. The design of the decree being to set aside the ceremonial law, and its carnal ordinances, believers were confirmed in the Christian faith, because it set up a spiritual way of serving God, as suited to the nature both of God and man. Thus the church increased in numbers daily.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And as they went through the cities - The cities of Syria, Cilicia, etc.<p>They delivered them - Paul and Silas delivered to the Christians in those cities.<p>The decrees - &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;  ta dogmata.

But St. Paul might well feel himself bound to deliver the decree to the Churches evangelised by him before the conference in Jerusalem.
