As the third person is now resumed, we may infer that St. Luke remained at Philippi, Timothy accompanying the other two. It would seem from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-2.htm" title="And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,">Acts 20:2</a> that the Evangelist made Philippi the centre of his evangelising work for many years. Under the care of the beloved physician, the good work went on, and we may probably trace to his influence, and to Lydia’s kindness, the generous help which was sent to St. Paul once and again when he was at Thessalonica (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Philippians 4:15-16</a>), and, probably, at Corinth also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2Corinthians 11:9</a>). Long years afterwards he cherished a grateful memory of the men and women who had laboured with him at Philippi. Among these we may think of the Clement, of whom he thus speaks, possibly identical with the Flavius Clemens, who occupies a prominent position among the apostolic fathers, and was traditionally the third Bishop of Rome. (See, however, Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.)<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-40.htm" title="And they went out of the prison, and entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brothers, they comforted them, and departed.">Acts 16:40</a></span>. <span class="ital">And they went out, </span>&c. — The servants of Christ, being honourably cleared from every crime by this public release, left the prison quietly, and went to <span class="ital">the house of Lydia </span>— With whom they had lodged before; <span class="ital">and when they had seen the brethren </span>— The disciples whom they had made; <span class="ital">they comforted them </span>— By rehearsing what God had done both for them and by them, in prison; and <span class="ital">exhorted them </span>(as the word also signifies) to steadfastness in the faith, and such exemplary conduct as Christianity always requires, and was peculiarly suitable to their present circumstances; <span class="ital">and </span>then they <span class="ital">departed — </span>Though many circumstances now invited their stay at Philippi; yet they showed great wisdom in complying with the request of the magistrates, that they might not seem to express any degree of obstinacy or revenge, or give any suspicion of a design to stir up the people.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may observe here, that of all the churches planted by Paul, this at Philippi seems to have loved and respected him the most. The sufferings he had undergone in their city, for the sake of giving them the knowledge of the gospel, more precious than gold, greatly endeared him to them. Accordingly, while he was at Thessalonica, they sent him money twice, that, by making the gospel without expense to the Thessalonians, they might give the more heed to the things which Paul spake, when they found him a teacher of a different character from the Greek philosophers, who taught only for hire. They likewise sent him money during his first imprisonment at Rome, that he might want nothing necessary for him. In short, the injurious treatment which Paul and Silas met with in this first city of Europe, where they had preached, was abundantly compensated by the readiness of mind with which many of its inhabitants received the gospel; and by the excellent disposition which they showed after their conversion, in the great love which they all along expressed toward their spiritual father. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:35-40 Paul, though willing to suffer for the cause of Christ, and without any desire to avenge himself, did not choose to depart under the charge of having deserved wrongful punishment, and therefore required to be dismissed in an honourable manner. It was not a mere point of honour that the apostle stood upon, but justice, and not to himself so much as to his cause. And when proper apology is made, Christians should never express personal anger, nor insist too strictly upon personal amends. The Lord will make them more than conquerors in every conflict; instead of being cast down by their sufferings, they will become comforters of their brethren.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They comforted them - They exhorted them, and encouraged them to persevere, notwithstanding the opposition and persecution which they might meet with.<p>And departed - That is, Paul and Silas departed. It would appear probable that Luke and Timothy remained in Philippi, or, at least, did not attend Paul and Silas. For Luke, who, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-10.htm">Acts 16:10</a>, uses the first person, and speaks of himself as with Paul and Silas, speaks of them now in the third person, implying that he was not with them until Paul had arrived at Troas, where Luke joined him from Philippi, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm">Acts 20:5-6</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>, also, Timothy is mentioned as being at Berea in company with Silas, from which it appears that he did not accompany Paul and Silas to Thessalonica.

And they went out of the prison&#8212;Having attained their object&#8212;to vindicate their civil rights, by the infraction of which in this case the Gospel in their persons had been illegally affronted&#8212;they had no mind to carry the matter farther. Their citizenship was valuable to them only as a shield against unnecessary injuries to their Master's cause. What a beautiful mixture of dignity and meekness is this! Nothing secular, which may be turned to the account of the Gospel, is morbidly disregarded; in any other view, nothing of this nature is set store by:&#8212;an example this for all ages.<p>and entered into the house of Lydia&#8212;as if to show by this leisurely proceeding that they had not been made to leave, but were at full liberty to consult their own convenience.<p>and when they had seen the brethren&#8212;not only her family and the jailer's, but probably others now gained to the Gospel.<p>they comforted them&#8212;rather, perhaps, "exhorted" them, which would include comfort. "This assembly of believers in the house of Lydia was the first church that had been founded in Europe" [Baumgarten].<p>and departed&#8212;but not all; for two of the company remained behind (see on [2038]Ac 17:14): Timotheus, of whom the Philippians "learned the proof" that he honestly cared for their state, and was truly like-minded with Paul, "serving with him in the Gospel as a son with his father" (Php 2:19-23); and Luke, "whose praise is in the Gospel," though he never praises himself or relates his own labors, and though we only trace his movements in connection with Paul, by the change of a pronoun, or the unconscious variation of his style. In the seventeenth chapter the narrative is again in the third person, and the pronoun is not changed to the second till we come to Ac 20:5. The modesty with which Luke leaves out all mention of his own labors need hardly be pointed out. We shall trace him again when he rejoins Paul in the same neighborhood. His vocation as a physician may have brought him into connection with these contiguous coasts of Asia and Europe, and he may (as Mr. Smith suggests, "Shipwreck," &c.) have been in the habit of exercising his professional skill as a surgeon at sea [Howson].   <p>Ac 15:41-16:5.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-5.htm" title="These going before tarried for us at Troas.">Acts 20:5</a> we again have <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> introduced, and the inference is that St. Luke remained at Philippi during the interval, or at least for a part of it; and it is reasonable to infer that he laboured there in the Gospel, although he modestly refrains (as elsewhere) from any notice of his own work. The Apostle’s first visit to Philippi represented in epitome the universality of the Gospel, so characteristic of St. Luke’s record of our Lord’s teaching, and so characteristic of the mind of St. Paul. Both from a religious and social point of view the conversions at Philippi are full of significance. The Jew could express his thankfulness in his morning prayer that God had not made him a Gentile—a woman—a slave. But at Philippi St. Paul taught in action the principle which he enforced in his Galatian Epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>, and again in writing to the <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-11.htm" title=" Where there is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor uncircumcision, Barbarian, Scythian, bond nor free: but Christ is all, and in all.">Colossians 3:11</a> : “Christ was all and in all”; in Him the soothsaying slave-girl, the proselyte of Thyatira, the Roman jailor, were each and all the children of God, and fellow-citizens with the saints, Lightfoot, Introduction to <span class="ital">Philippians;</span> Taylor, <span class="ital">Sayings of the Jewish Fathers</span>, pp. 15, 26, 137 (second edition).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The narrative of St. Paul’s visit to Philippi has been made the object of attack from various quarters. Most of the objections have been stated and met by Professor Ramsay, and a summary of them with their refutation is aptly given in a recent article by Dr. Giesekke (<span class="ital">Studien und Kritiken</span>, 1898) described at length in the <span class="ital">Expository Times</span>, March, 1898, see also Knabenbauer, pp. 292, 293. The view that the narrative is simply a fiction modelled upon the escape of St. Peter in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm" title="Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.">Acts 4:12</a> is untenable in face of the many differences in the narratives (see the points of contrast in Nösgen, <span class="ital">Apostel geschichte</span>, pp. 315, 316). (Schneckenburger in his list of parallels between Peter and Paul in Acts apparently makes no mention of the supposed parallel here.) Zeller’s attempt to connect the narrative with the story in Lucian’s <span class="ital">Toxaris</span>, c. 27, is still more absurd, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Zöckler, <span class="ital">Apostelgeschichte</span>, p. 262 (second edition), and Farrar, <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, i., 501, whilst more recently Schmiedel (1898) attempts to find a parallel in Euripides, <span class="ital">Bacchæ</span>, 436–441, 502, 602–628, see Wendt’s note, p. 282 (1899). Weizsäckcr boldly refuses to admit even the imprisonment as a fact, and regards only the meeting of Paul with the soothsayer as historical. But it should be noted that he allows the Apostle’s intercourse with Lydia and his instruction of the women to be genuine historical incidents, and he makes the important remark that the name of Lydia is the more credible, since the Philippian Epistle seems to support the idea that women received Paul and contributed to the planting of the Church (<span class="ital">Apostolic Age</span>, i., 284, E.T.). Holtzmann represents in a general manner the standpoint of modern advanced criticism, when he divides the narrative of the events at Philippi into two parts, the one concerned with events transacted under the open heaven, belonging not only to the “We” source but bearing also the stamp of reality, whilst the other part is not guaranteed by the “We” source, and is full of legendary matter. Thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-25.htm" title="And at midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises to God: and the prisoners heard them....">Acts 16:25-34</a> are dismissed as a later addition, and Ramsay’s fresh and careful explanations are dismissed by Holtzmann as “humbug”! <span class="ital">Theologische Literaturzeitung</span>, No. 7, 1899.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Additional Note.—Chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-12.htm" title="And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.">Acts 16:12</a>, “which is a city of Macedonia, the first of the district,” R.V. This <span class="ital">might</span> mean, so far as <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> is concerned, that Philippi was the city nearest in the district, and the city which they first reached. Neapolis, which actually came first on the route, was not generally regarded as Macedonian but Thracian; so Lightfoot, Rendall, O. Holtzmann. Or it might also mean that it was “the chief” (A.V.), the leading city of its division of Macedonia (Ramsay). Here again Ramsay sees a proof of St. Luke’s intimate acquaintance with the rivalries of the Greek cities, and of his special interest in Philippi. In B.C. 167 the province Macedonia had been divided by the Romans into four districts, <span class="greekheb">μερίς</span>, and even if this division were obsolete at the time, another would be likely to succeed to it (so Ramsay, <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, p. 158, as against Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, p. 50, who takes <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> as denoting not the political but the geographical position of Philippi.) At this time Amphipolis was the chief (<span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span>) city of the district to which both it and Philippi belonged, but though Amphipolis held the rank, Philippi claimed the same title, a case of rivalry between two or even three cities which often occurred. This single passage Ramsay regards as conclusive of the claims of Philippi, see <span class="ital">St. Paul</span>, p. 207, and <span class="ital">Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia</span>, ii., 429. As to whether <span class="greekheb">μερίς</span> can be used in the sense of a division of a province, <span class="ital">cf.</span> Ramsay, <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, p. 158, and the instances quoted from Egypt, and also <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, October, 1897, p. 320, as against Hort’s limitation of the term. Hort, W.H[301], App. 96 (to whose view Rendall inclines, <span class="ital">cf.</span> also Zahn, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>, i., p. 375), thinks that <span class="greekheb">μερίδος</span> must be a corruption, and proposes <span class="greekheb">Πιερίδος</span>, Pieria being an ancient name of that part of Macedonia; but he declines to draw any positive conclusion in its favour. Wendt, following Meyer, regards <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> as signifying rank, and so far he is in agreement with Ramsay. But as Amphipolis was really the chief town of the district, he contends that <span class="greekheb">πόλις κολωνία</span> might be taken as one phrase (see also Hackett, Overbeck, Weiss, Holtzmann), and so he regards the whole expression as signifying that Philippi is spoken of as the most considerable colony-town in that district of Macedonia, whilst he agrees with Hort and Lightfoot in maintaining that <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> is only classical as an absolute title of towns in Asia Minor. This Ramsay allows, but the title was frequent in Asia and Cilicia, and might easily have been used elsewhere, <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, p. 156; Holtzmann quite admits that the term may have been applied as in Asian towns to signify the enjoyment of certain privileges. For Ramsay’s criticism of Codex [302], which substitutes <span class="greekheb">κεφαλὴ τῆς Μ</span>. and omits <span class="greekheb">μερίδος</span> altogether, see <span class="ital">Church in the Roman Empire</span>, pp. 156, 157, and <span class="ital">Expositor, u. s.</span>, <span class="greekheb">κεφαλή</span> being evidently substituted because the term <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> is ambiguous, and so liable to be misunderstood. Blass himself finds fault with , and also considers <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> wrong, not only because Amphipolis was superior in rank, but because Thessalonica was called <span class="greekheb">πρώτη Μακεδόνων</span>, <span class="ital">C. T. Gr</span>[303], 1967. But this would not prevent the rivalry amongst other towns in the various subdivisions of the province.

("<span class="accented">they</span> had passed," etc.) that St. Luke stopped at Philippi, and probably made it his head-quarters till St. Paul's last journey from Macedonia to Jerusalem, some six or seven years later (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-6.htm">Acts 20:6</a>).
