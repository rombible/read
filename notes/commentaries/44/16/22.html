This, therefore, takes its place as one of the three instances to which St. Paul refers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2Corinthians 11:25</a>. The question naturally occurs, why he did not, on these occasions, claim, as he did afterwards at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>), the privileges of a Roman citizen. Some have supposed that the violence of the mob rendered it impossible for his claim to be heard. Others have even questioned the truthfulness of his claim. A more natural supposition is that he would not assert in this instance a right which would only have secured exemption for himself, and left his companion to suffer the ignominious penalty of the law, and that by putting the <span class= "ital">strategi</span> in the wrong, he sought to secure for his disciples afterwards a more tolerant treatment. As far as the first part of this hypothesis is concerned, it may, perhaps, be accepted (see, however, Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>); but such of the Philippian disciples as belonged to the <span class= "ital">colonia, were</span> already protected from outrages of this kind as Roman citizens. Others, however, of the freed-men class, were still liable to them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-22.htm" title="And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them....">Acts 16:22-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the multitude rose up against them </span>— Excited and inflamed by these accusations; <span class="ital">and the magistrates </span>— Or the pretors; <span class="ital">rent off their clothes </span>— That is, the clothes of Paul and Silas; for such was the Roman method of proceeding in such cases. Their magistrates were wont to command the lictors <span class="ital">to rend open the clothes of the criminals, and to beat their bodies with rods; </span>as Grotius here observes. <span class="ital">And when they had laid many stripes upon them </span>— Had severely scourged them; (either they did not immediately say they were Romans, or in the tumult it was not regarded;) <span class="ital">they cast them into prison, charging the jailer to keep them safely </span>— Lest, among their numerous friends, a rescue should be attempted; <span class="ital">who, having received such a charge </span>— A charge so strict, and from persons of such great rank; <span class="ital">thrust them into the inner prison — </span>Where he thought them perfectly secure; especially as he also <span class="ital">made their feet fast in the stocks </span>— These were probably those large pieces of wood, in use among the Romans, which not only loaded the legs of the prisoner, but kept them extended in a very painful manner. So that it is highly probable the situation of Paul and Silas here was much more painful than that of an offender sitting in the stocks among us, especially if they lay, as it is very possible they did, with their backs, so lately scourged, on the damp and dirty ground. These multiplied injuries, however, these servants of God, conscious of their integrity, and enjoying a sense of the divine favour, bore not only with entire resignation, but with great joy.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:16-24 Satan, though the father of lies, will declare the most important truths, when he can thereby serve his purposes.

Of this Paul afterward justly complained, as it was a violation of the privileges of a Roman citizen, and contrary to the laws. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm">Acts 16:37</a>.

They who should have been their protectors until they had had a fair trial according to law.<p>Rent off their clothes - This was always done when one was to be scourged or whipped. The criminal was usually stripped entirely naked. Livy says (ii. 5), "The lictors, being sent to inflict punishment, beat them with rods, being naked." Cicero, against Verres, says, "He commanded the man to be seized, and to be stripped naked in the midst of the forum, and to be bound, and rods to be brought."<p>And commanded to beat them - &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  rabdizein. To beat them with rods. This was done by lictors, whose office it was, and was a common mode of punishment among the Romans. Probably Paul alludes to this as one of the instances which occurred in his life of his being publicly scourged, when he says <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, "Thrice was I beaten with rods." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. the multitude rose up together against them&#8212;so Ac 19:28, 34; 21:30; Lu 23:18.<p>the magistrates rent off their&#8212;Paul's and Silas'<p>clothes&#8212;that is, ordered the lictors, or rod-bearers, to tear them off, so as to expose their naked bodies (see on [2035]Ac 16:37).

And at the same time (“cum ancillae dominis,” Bengel) the multitude rose up (in a tumultuary manner) against them; therefore the praetors, intimidated thereby, in order temporarily to still the urgency of the mob, commanded the accused to be scourged without examination, and then, until further orders, to be thrown into strict confinement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περιῤῥήξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια</span>] <span class="ital">after having torn off their clothes</span>.

Erasmus erroneously desired to read <span class="greekheb">αὑτῶν</span>, so that the praetors would have rent their own clothes from indignation. Apart from the <span class="ital">non-Roman</span> character of such a custom, there may be urged against this view the compound <span class="greekheb">περιῤῥ</span>., which denotes that the rending took place all <span class="ital">round about</span> the whole body (Plat. <span class="ital">Crit.</span> p. 113 D: <span class="greekheb">περιῤῥήγνυσι κύκλῳ</span>, Polyb. xv. 33, 4, <span class="ital">al.;</span> comp.

Men of strong character may, amidst unjust suffering, exhibit in presence of their oppressors their <span class="ital">moral defiance</span>, even in <span class="ital">resignation</span>. We make this remark in opposition to Zeller (comp. Baur), who finds the brutal conduct of the praetors, and the non-employment by the apostles of their legal privilege in self-defence (which Paul, moreover, renounced not merely on this occasion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>), inexplicable. Bengel well remarks: “Non semper omnibus praesidiis omni modo utendum; divino regimini auscultandum.” In a similar plight, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>, Paul found it befitting to interpose an assertion of his privilege, which he here only used for <span class="ital">the completion of his victory</span> over the persecution, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>,—a result which, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>, according to the divine destination which he was aware of, he recognised as unattainable.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/16.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-22.htm" title="And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.">Acts 16:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">συνεπέστη</span>: only here in N.T., <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm" title="And when Gallio was the deputy of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,">Acts 18:12</a>, not in LXX, but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-3.htm" title="And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, You take too much on you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then lift you up yourselves above the congregation of the LORD?">Numbers 16:3</a>, used in classical Greek, but not in same sense. No reason is given, but the <span class="greekheb">ὄχλος</span> would have been easily swayed by hatred of the Jews, and further incensed perhaps at finding an end put to their love of the revelations of fortune-telling.—<span class="greekheb">περιῤῥήξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν τὰ ἱμάτια</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, they rent off the garments of Paul and Silas; just as there is no change of subject before <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθ</span>., so here probably what was done by the lictors is said to have been done by the magistrates. There is no need to suppose with Bengel that the prætors tore off the prisoners’ clothes with their own hands. Grotius (but see on the other hand Calvin’s note <span class="ital">in loco</span>) takes the words as meaning that the prætors rent off their own clothes (reading <span class="greekheb">αὑτῶν</span>); so Ramsay speaks of the prætors rending their garments in horror at the <span class="greekheb">ἀσέβεια</span>, the impiety. But not only would such an act be strange on the part of Roman magistrates, but also the verb seems to make against the interpretation; it means in classical and in later Greek to rend all round, tear off, <span class="ital">cf.</span> the numerous instances in Wetstein, and so it expresses the rough way in which the lictors tore off the garments of the prisoners. In <a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-38.htm" title="And being kindled with anger, forthwith he took away Andronicus his purple, and rent off his clothes, and leading him through the whole city unto that very place, where he had committed impiety against Onias, there slew he the cursed murderer. Thus the Lord rewarded him his punishment, as he had deserved.">2Ma 4:38</a> the word is used of tearing off the garments of another, see Wendt’s (1888) note <span class="ital">in loco.</span>—<span class="greekheb">ῥαβδίζειν</span>: to beat with rods: thrice St. Paul suffered this punishment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="Thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, a night and a day I have been in the deep;">2 Corinthians 11:25</a>, grievous and degrading, of a Roman scourging, <span class="ital">cf.</span> his own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="But even after that we had suffered before, and were shamefully entreated, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much contention.">1 Thessalonians 2:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὑβρισθέντες ὡς οἴδατε ἐν Φιλίπποις</span>. Nothing can be alleged against the truthfulness of the narrative on the ground that Paul as a Roman citizen could not have been thus maltreated. The whole proceeding was evidently tumultuary and hasty, and the magistrates acted with the high-handedness characteristic of the fussy provincial authorities; in such a scene St. Paul’s protest may well have been made, but would very easily be disregarded. The incident in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm" title="And as they bound him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to whip a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?">Acts 22:25</a>, which shows us how the Apostle barely escaped a similar punishment amidst the tumult and shouts of the mob in Jerusalem, and the instances quoted by Cicero, <span class="ital">In Verr.</span>, v., 62, of a prisoner remorselessly scourged, while he cried “inter dolorem crepitumque plagarum” <span class="ital">Civis Romanus sum</span>, enables us to see how easily Paul and Silas (who probably enjoyed the Roman citizenship, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-37.htm" title="But Paul said to them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privately? no truly; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.">Acts 16:37</a>) might have protested and yet have suffered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">the multitude rose up together</span>] i.e. together with the aggrieved proprietors of the damsel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the magistrates rent off their clothes</span>] i.e. the clothes of Paul and Silas, as is clear from the Greek verb, but not so evident from the A.V.
