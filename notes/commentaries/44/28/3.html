The fact thus mentioned has been dwelt on as militating against the identity of Melita and Malta, no wood being now found in the island except at one spot (<span class= "ital">Bosquetta</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>not near St. Paul’s Bay. The Greek word, however, is applied to the dry stalks of herbaceous plants rather than to the branches of trees, and, as such, exactly describes the stout, thorny heather that still grows near the bay. It is clear, however, apart from this, that the people of Malta did not live without fire, and, not having coal, must therefore have had wood of some kind as fuel.<p><span class= "bld">There came</span> <span class= "bld">a viper out of the heat.</span>—There are said to be no venomous serpents now in Malta, and this again has been pressed into the question of the identity of the island. Mr. Lewin, however (<span class= "ital">St. Paul, </span>ii. 208), states that he saw a serpent, near St. Paul’s Bay, that looked very like a viper; and even if he were mistaken in this, it would be natural enough that venomous snakes should disappear under the influence of culture, as they have done elsewhere, in the course of 1800 years.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/28-3.htm" title="And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand....">Acts 28:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when Paul </span>— Who had learned to make himself servant of all, and would stoop to any thing by which he might be serviceable, was laying <span class="ital">on the fire a bundle of sticks </span>— Which he had gathered; <span class="ital">there came a viper </span>— Which had been concealed among the wood; <span class="ital">out of the heat, and fastened on his hand </span>— Round which it probably twisted itself, and bit it. <span class="ital">And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast </span>— Or the fierce animal, as <span class="greekheb">θηριον </span>should rather be translated; the word <span class="ital">beast </span>being a very improper term for it; <span class="ital">they said </span>— Seeing also his chains; <span class="ital">No doubt this man is a murderer </span>— “They concluded he was a murderer, (says Elsner,) rather than a person guilty of any other crime, because they saw the viper hanging on his hand, which therefore they judged to have been the offending member, according to the rule which prevailed among the ancients, that persons were often remarkably punished in that part of the body which had been the immediate instrument of their sin;” <span class="ital">whom, though he hath escaped the sea </span>— Hath not been destroyed by the tempest and shipwreck; <span class="ital">yet vengeance suffereth not </span>(Greek, <span class="greekheb">ουκ ειασεν</span>, <span class="ital">hath not suffered</span>) <span class="ital">to live </span>— They looked upon him as, in effect, a dead man already, after having been bit by that venomous creature. The poison of a viper so inflames the blood, that a person infected with it is usually tormented as with fire, and quickly dies. For this reason, the ancient Scythians, in war, used to dip their arrows in the blood and gaul of vipers, that their enemies wounded by them might die a painful and sudden death. And, in some remote times, some condemned criminals were put to death by vipers set to their breasts: by this means Cleopatra despatched herself. Though <span class="greekheb">δικη</span>, (<span class="ital">justice, </span>or <span class="ital">judgment,</span>) here rendered <span class="ital">vengeance, </span>may be understood of the divine vengeance in general; yet, as these were the words of heathen idolaters, possibly they might refer to a deity worshipped among them under that name; as we know the Greeks and Romans had a goddess whom they termed <span class="greekheb">Νεμεσις</span>, <span class="ital">Nemesis, </span>the daughter of Justice, who, they supposed, punished the wicked. It must give us pleasure to trace among these barbarians the force of conscience, and the belief of a particular providence; which some people of more learning have stupidly thought it philosophy to despise. But they erred in imagining that calamities must always be interpreted as judgments. Let us guard against this error, lest, like them, we condemn, not only the innocent, but <span class="ital">the excellent of the earth.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-10 God can make strangers to be friends; friends in distress. Those who are despised for homely manners, are often more friendly than the more polished; and the conduct of heathens, or persons called barbarians, condemns many in civilized nations, professing to be Christians. The people thought that Paul was a murderer, and that the viper was sent by Divine justice, to be the avenger of blood. They knew that there is a God who governs the world, so that things do not come to pass by chance, no, not the smallest event, but all by Divine direction; and that evil pursues sinners; that there are good works which God will reward, and wicked works which he will punish. Also, that murder is a dreadful crime, one which shall not long go unpunished. But they thought all wicked people were punished in this life. Though some are made examples in this world, to prove that there is a God and a Providence, yet many are left unpunished, to prove that there is a judgment to come. They also thought all who were remarkably afflicted in this life were wicked people. Divine revelation sets this matter in a true light. Good men often are greatly afflicted in this life, for the trial and increase of their faith and patience. Observe Paul's deliverance from the danger. And thus in the strength of the grace of Christ, believers shake off the temptations of Satan, with holy resolution. When we despise the censures and reproaches of men, and look upon them with holy contempt, having the testimony of our consciences for us, then, like Paul, we shake off the viper into the fire. It does us no harm, except we are kept by it from our duty. God hereby made Paul remarkable among these people, and so made way for the receiving of the gospel. The Lord raises up friends for his people in every place whither he leads them, and makes them blessings to those in affliction.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Had gathered a bundle of sticks - For the purpose of making a fire.<p>There came a viper - A poisonous serpent. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>. The viper was doubtless in the bundle of sticks or limbs of trees which Paul had gathered, but was concealed, and was torpid. But when the bundle was laid on the fire, the viper became warmed by the heat, and came out and fastened on the hand of Paul.<p>And fastened on his hand - &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;  kathe&#772;psen. This word properly means to join oneself to; to touch; to adhere to. It might have been by coiling around his hand and arm, or by fastening its fangs in his hand. It is not expressly affirmed that Paul was bitten by the viper, yet it is evidently implied; and it is wholly incredible that a viper, unless miraculously prevented, should fasten himself to the hand without biting. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks&#8212;"a quantity of dry sticks."

Had picked up some sticks, and put them in a bundle fit for the fire, as everyone was busy to assist in this extremity; nor did the apostle think such an action below him, who in all things was a man of great humility and condescension: <p>and laid them on the fire; to increase it: <p>there came a viper out of the heat: a viper is a kind of serpent, which brings forth its young living, to the number of twenty, only one in a day, which come forth wrapped up in thin skins, which break on the third day, and set them at liberty; and so is reckoned among viviparous animals, from whence it seems to have its name, whereas other serpents lay eggs and hatch them. It is said (k), that this remarkable reptile has the biggest and flattest head of all the serpent kind; its usual length is about half an ell, and its thickness an inch; its snout is not unlike that of a hog; it has sixteen small immovable teeth in each jaw, besides two other large, sharp, hooked, hollow, transparent, canine teeth, situate at each side of the upper jaw, which are those that do the mischief: these are flexible in their articulation, and are ordinarily laid flat along the jaw, the animal never raising them but when it would bite The roots or bases of these teeth, or fangs, are encompassed with a vesicle or bladder, containing the quantity of a large drop of a yellow insipid salivous juice.--It has only one row of teeth, whereas all other serpents have two; its body is not at all fetid, whereas the inner parts of the bodies of other serpents are intolerable.--It creeps very slowly, and never leaps like other serpents, though it is nimble enough to bite when provoked.--Its body is of two colours, ash coloured or yellow, and the ground speckled with longish brown spots; the scales under its belly are of the colour of well polished steel. Its bite is exceeding venomous, and its poison the most dangerous. Now when this viper here is said to come out of the heat, the meaning is, that it came out from the sticks, which were laid upon the fire, being forced from thence by the heat of it: and so the Syriac version renders it, "there came out of them" (the sticks) "a viper, because of the heat of the fire"; it lay quiet among the sticks, among which, and such like things, this creature often lies; but when the fire began to heat it, it sprung out: <p>and fastened on his hand; or wrapped itself about his hand: the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "bit his hand"; but that does not seem so likely, since he felt no harm by it; the Ethiopic version, "hung upon his hand"; which agrees with what follows; nor is it inconsistent with its wrapping itself about his hand, which is the more proper signification of the word used. <p>(k) Chambers's Cyclopaedia in the word "Viper". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{1}</span> And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid <i>them</i> on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.</span><p>(1) The godly are sure to have danger upon danger, but they alway have a glorious outcome.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/28.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-3.htm" title="And when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid them on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.">Acts 28:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θέρμ</span>.] (see the critical remarks) <span class="ital">on account of</span> the heat.[176] See Winer, p. 348 [E.

From this at the same time it follows just as certainly, that the animal must have been definitely known to the islanders as a <span class="ital">poisonous</span> viper. Hence we must reject the view of Bochart, <span class="ital">Hieroz</span>. ii. 3, p. 369: “illigavit se etc., nempe <span class="ital">ut</span> … morderet, sed earn <span class="ital">cohibuit</span> Deus, sicut leones illos, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/4-22.htm" title="It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.">Daniel 4:22</a>,” and of Kuinoel (comp. Heinrichs): “erat autem vipera ista aut non venenata, etsi Melitenses eam pro venenata habuerint, aut si erat, insinuavit quidem se Pauli manui, non vero momordit.” The latter (also hinted at by Ewald) follows least of all from <span class="greekheb">ἔπαθεν οὐδὲν κακόν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-5.htm" title="And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.">Acts 28:5</a>, by which the very absence of result (brought about by special divine help) is placed in contrast with the poisonous bite. Nevertheless, Lange (<span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt</span>. II. p. 344 f.) supposes that the reptile may have hung encircling his hand without biting, and Lekebusch, p. 382, that Luke had in view the alternative contained in Kuinoel’s explanation. Indeed, according to Hausrath, the judgment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-5.htm" title="And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.">Acts 28:5</a> is only <span class="ital">ascribed</span> to the islanders by Luke.

In classical Greek <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span> is "to twist up together," to "form into a compact body," and the like. <span class="cmt_word">A bundle of sticks</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. The word only occurs in the New Testament here; it means "dry sticks," "kindlers," any combustible material. In the LXX. it is used as the equi- valent of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b7;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, straw or stubble (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-24.htm">Isaiah 40:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-2.htm">Isaiah 41:2</a>, etc.), and for "nettles" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/30-7.htm">Job 30:7</a>). Theophrastus seems to use it for plants smaller than a shrub ('Hist.,' Plant., 1:3, 1, quoted by Hobart). Lewin (vol. it. p. 208) writes as follows: - "When in Malta in 1853, I went to St. Paul's Bay at the same season of the year as when the wreck occurred .... We noticed eight or nine stacks of small faggots, they consisted of a kind of thorny heather, and had evidently been cut for firewood." This is a conclusive answer, if any were needed, to the objection to Melita being Malta, drawn from the absence of wood in the island. But besides this, it is not a fact that even now there is no wood at all (see Lewin). <span class="cmt_word">A viper came out</span>. It is objected that there are no vipers in Malta. But it is obvious that the condition of Malta now, a very thickly inhabited island (one thousand two hundred people to the square mile, Lewin, p. 208), is very different from what it was with a sparse population in the days of St. Paul. Vipers may well have been destroyed during one thousand eight hundred and sixty years. Lewin mentions that his traveling companions in 1853 started what they thought was a viper, which escaped into one of the bundles of heather. <span class="accented">Came out.</span> <span class="greek">&#x394;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> is the reading of Tischendorf, Alford, Meyer, eta., "came out through the sticks." It is a frequent medical term. <span class="cmt_word">The heat</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>.
