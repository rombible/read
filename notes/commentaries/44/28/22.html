The speakers had clearly heard enough of the prisoner to identify him with that sect, but they treat him personally with respect, probably due in part to the favour which the authorities had shown him, and wish for an authoritative exposition of his views. The Christians of Rome had obviously, even if they were Jews, withdrawn from the Jewish quarter, and the residents in that quarter knew of them only by reports. What was the nature of those reports we can only conjecture. They were, as the speakers say, “everywhere spoken against.” The darker calumnies which were propagated afterwards—stories of Thyestean (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>cannibal) banquets and licentious orgies—may possibly have been even then whispered from ear to ear. In any case the Christians of the empire would be known as abandoning circumcision and other Jewish ordinances, leading a separate life, holding meetings which were more or less secret, worshipping One who had been crucified as a malefactor. They were already, as Tacitus describes them, speaking of their sufferings under Nero, known as holding an <span class= "ital">exitiabilis superstitio</span> (“a detestable superstition”), guilty of <span class= "ital">atrocia et pudenda, odio humani generis convicti</span> (“atrocious and shameful crimes, convicted by the hatred of mankind”) (<span class= "ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44), or as Suetonius writes (<span class= "ital">Nero, </span>c. 16), as a <span class= "ital">genus hominum superstitionis novœ et maleficœ</span> (“a race of men holding a new and criminal superstition”). It is conceivable, looking to the early date at which such rumours were current, that even then there may have been caricatures like that which was found among the <span class= "ital">graffiti</span> of the Palace of the Cæsars (now in the Collegio Romano), representing Alexamenos, a Christian convert, worshipping his god, in the form of a crucified human figure with an ass’s head. Tertullian (A.D. 160-240) mentions such caricatures as current in his time (<span class= "ital">Apol.</span> c. 16), and the story that the Jews worshipped an ass’s head, which we know to have been accepted at this very time (Jos. <span class= "ital">cont. Apion.</span> ii. 7; Tacit <span class= "ital">Hist.</span> v. 4), would naturally be transferred to the Christians, who were regarded as a sect of Jews. In Tertullian’s time <span class= "ital">Asinarii</span> (“ass-worshippers”) was a common term of abuse for them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:17-22 It was for the honour of Paul that those who examined his case, acquitted him. In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, but only to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of common concern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions and private interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but all its gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, the lot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Look through every town and village where Christ is exalted as the only Saviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him in newness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ, still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatment they are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodly man upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What thou thinkest - What your belief is; or what are the doctrines of Christians respecting the Messiah.<p>This sect - The sect of Christians.<p>Spoken against - Particularly by Jews.

and what he had to say for the clearing up, proving, and confirming his sentiments about these things: <p>for as concerning this sect; or heresy, meaning the Christian religion: in saying so, they reproached it; for the Gospel, or Christian religion, is not an human device, the choice and option of man's free will, and what he pleases himself with, as an opinion and invention of his own, or of other men, as "heresy" signifies; but it is of God, and by revelation of Jesus Christ, and is a doctrine of the highest wisdom: nor does it deny or take away any fundamental article of true religion; either natural, as known by the Gentiles, or as revealed, with which the Jews were made acquainted, under the former dispensation; but establishes every such article, as the unity of the divine Being; the worship of the one only and true God of Israel, in a spiritual manner; the doctrine of the Messiah, his person, office, and grace; the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment; and therefore could not be chargeable with heresy: nor was it set up for any worldly gain, or popular applause, which are the things that authors and abettors of heresy have in view; nor was it designed to divide and separate persons from the true church of God, but to bring them to it, and unite them together in it; see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm">Acts 24:14</a>. <p>We know that everywhere it is spoken against; this they knew, both by letters they received, and by persons who came from different parts of the world; and which was fact, and was no other than what was foretold concerning Christ, that he should be a sign that should be spoken against, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm">Luke 2:34</a>; and which the apostle found true of the Gospel preached by him, both among Jews and Greeks; it being to the one a stumblingblock, and to the other foolishness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>, and especially it was contradicted and blasphemed everywhere by the Jews; these in all places opposed themselves to it, and spoke evil of it, and of its preachers and professors: Christ, the author, sum, and subject of the Christian religion, was spoken against in his person; his deity and divine sonship were denied, as they still are; and his offices, as prophet, priest, and King; yea, his actions, even his works of mercy to the bodies of men, by healing their diseases, his conversing with sinners for the good of their souls, the several miracles he wrought, and the whole series of his life and conversation, were blasphemed and evil spoken of: the doctrines of the Gospel in general were contradicted, as they now are by many, as absurd and irrational, and as tending to licentiousness; and in particular those which respect the Father of Christ, as being the Father of Christ, his everlasting love to the elect in him, and his distinguishing grace in the choice of them; and those which relate to Christ, as that he is truly God, and the Son of God, and to his sacrifice, satisfaction, and imputed righteousness; and also which concern the Spirit of God, as his deity and personality, and his operations on the souls of men; and such as relate to a future state, the resurrection of all the dead, and judgment to come: likewise the ordinances of the Christian religion, baptism and the Lord's supper, were despised and spoken against, and the professors of it treated as fools and wicked men; the reasons of all this are, because the Christian religion, and the doctrines of it, are not of men, are contrary to the lusts of men, and particularly to the pride of men; they subject them to reproach and persecution, and gather men out from among them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/28.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm" title="But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.">Acts 28:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀξιοῦμεν δέ</span>] <span class="ital">But we judge</span> (so as, in such lack of information from other quarters, to be better instructed concerning the circumstances in which thou art placed) <span class="ital">it right</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>)—as a claim which, as matters stand, is no more than right and proper—<span class="ital">to learn from thee</span> (<span class="greekheb">παρὰ σοῦ</span> has emphasis), etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἃ φρονεῖς</span>] <span class="ital">i.e</span>. what principles and views thou pursuest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">περὶ μὲν γὰρ τῆς αἱρέσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ταύτ</span>.] <span class="ital">for of this party certainly</span>.

This difficulty is not solved by the arbitrary (comp. also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm" title="And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.">Acts 28:21</a>) assumption that, after the return of the Jews expelled by Claudius, the Jews and Christians kept aloof from each other and thus gradually lost acquaintance with one another (Olshausen; comp. also Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1837, p. 302 ff.); nor yet by the circumstances of such a great city as Rome, amidst which the existence of the Christian community might well have escaped the knowledge of the rich worldly Jews (Neander),—which, considering the relationship of Judaism and Christianity, would <span class="ital">a priori</span> be very improbable. It is rather to be explained, like the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-21.htm" title="And they said to him, We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning you, neither any of the brothers that came showed or spoke any harm of you.">Acts 28:21</a>, from a <span class="ital">cautious sort of official reserve in their demeanour</span>, not exactly hypocritical (Tholuck) or intimidated by the Claudian measures (Philippi, comp. Ewald), but in which withal the Jewish contempt for Christianity generally is apparent. The representation here given, according to which those Jews simply avoid any sort of expression compromising them, is by no means to be used, with Baur and Zeller, against the historical truth of the occurrence. Its historical character, on the contrary, gains support from the Epistle to the Romans itself, which shows no trace that <span class="ital">in Rome</span> Christianity had been in conflict with the Jews (see <span class="ital">Rom</span>. Introd. § 3). and therefore de Wette is wrong in his remark that, if Luke had only added <span class="greekheb">καὶ παρʼ ἡμῖν</span> to <span class="greekheb">πανταχοῦ</span>, there would have been no ground of offence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/28.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm" title="But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.">Acts 28:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἀξιοῦμεν δὲ</span>: “but we think good,” <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>.

See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.">Acts 28:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">γνωστόν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἡμῖν</span>: if the view is correct that the edict of Claudius, see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm" title="And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came to them.">Acts 18:2</a>, was occasioned by the early preaching of Christianity in Rome, it is possible that the dislocation of the Jewish community then caused may help at all events to explain why the Christian Church in Rome did not grow out of the Jewish synagogue in the capital to the same context as elsewhere, see Sanday and Headlam, <span class="ital">Romans</span>, pp. 21, 22. It may no doubt be urged that the Christian Church in Rome was not entirely a heathen-Christian Church, and that, as the names in Romans 16 indicate, it contained a Jewish element. But it is quite conceivable that in the capital, with its two million inhabitants, the Jews, who had only recently returned to the city, should know nothing beyond what is here indicated in such general terms of a poor and obscure sect who dwelt no longer in the Jewish quarter. It is also worthy of consideration that the Jews of Rome, whilst not guilty of any untruth in what they had just said as to their knowledge of the Christian sect, may have expressed themselves in this guarded manner from political reasons. If St. Paul’s statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-18.htm" title="Who, when they had examined me, would have let me go, because there was no cause of death in me.">Acts 28:18</a> as to the favourable bearing of the Roman authorities towards him was true, it was but natural that the Jews should wish to refrain from hasty or hostile action towards a prisoner who was evidently treated with consideration in his bonds; they would rather act thus than revive an old quarrel which might again lead to their own political insecurity, see especially Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Philippians</span>, pp. 15, 16; Felten, <span class="ital">in loco</span>; and, further, Rendall, p. 352. Nothing said by the Jews contradicts the existence of a Christian community in Rome, nor is it said that they wished to learn the Christian tenets from Paul, as if they knew nothing of them from their own knowledge, or as if they knew nothing of the causes of the opposition to the Christian faith; motives of curiosity and of policy might well have prompted a desire to hear Paul speak for himself, and with such motives there was apparently mingled a tone of contempt for a sect of which they might fairly say, from the experience of their countrymen, and from their own experience in Rome, <span class="greekheb">πανταχοῦ ἀντιλέγεται</span>: <span class="greekheb">ἀντιλ</span>.
