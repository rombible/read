From that point, as they neared the city, the Appian Road would present more of its characteristic features—the tall milestones, the stately tombs, of which that to Cæcilia Metella, the wife of Crassus, is the most representative example, and which, lining either side, gave to the road the appearance of one long cemetery, and bore their record of the fame or the vanity, the wealth or the virtues, of the dead. As they drew nearer still, St. Paul’s companions would point out to him the Grove and the sacred spring in the valley of Egeria, now let to a. colony of squatters of his own race.<p>“Hic ubi nocturnæ Numa constituebat amicæ,<p>Nunc sacri fontis nemus et delubra locantur<p>Judæis, quorum cophinus fœnumque supellex.”<p>[“Here, by the sacred scenes of Numa’s love,<p>We let on lease the shrines, the stream, the grove,<p>To pauper Jews, who bring their scanty store<p>Of hay and hamper, and who ask no more.”]<p>—Juvenal, <span class= "ital">Sat.</span> iii. 12.<p>He would pass the cemetery of the Jews of Rome, lying on the east of the Appian Way, which within the last few years has been discovered and explored, in the <span class= "ital">Vigna Randanini, </span>and the <span class= "ital">Columbaria</span> (now in the <span class= "ital">Vigna Codini</span>) of the imperial household, with which, as themselves of the <span class= "ital">libertini</span> class, many of his friends and disciples were even then so closely connected. He would see, perhaps, even then, the beginning of the Catacombs, where the Christians, who would not burn their dead like the heathen, and who were excluded from the cemetery of the Jews, laid their dead to sleep in peace, in what was afterwards the Catacomb of St. Callistus. It may be noted here that the earliest inscription on any Jewish burial-place in Italy is one found at Naples, of the time of Claudius (A.D. 44) (Garucci, <span class= "ital">Cimitero degli antichi Ebrei, </span>p. 24; Mommsen, <span class= "ital">Inscriptt. Neap. Lat.</span> 6467), and the earliest Christian inscription with any note of time, of that of Vespasian (De Rossi, <span class= "ital">Inscriptt. Christ.</span> No. 1). It lies in the nature of the case, however, that at first both Jews and Christians were likely to bury their dead without any formal record, and had to wait for quieter times before they could indulge in the luxury of tombstones and epitaphs. Continuing his journey, the Apostle and his companions would come within view of the pyramid of Caius Cestius, would pass under the Arch of Drusus, which still stands outside the Porta di S. Sebastiano, and enter the city by the Porta Capena, or Capuan Gate, proceeding thence to the Palace of the Cæsars, which stood on the Palatine Hill, and looked down, on one side upon the Forum, on the other upon the Circus Maximus.<p><span class= "bld">Paul was suffered to dwell by himself.</span>—The centurion, on arriving at the Palace of the Cæsars, would naturally deliver his prisoners to the captain of the division of the Prætorian Guard stationed there as the emperor’s body-guard. The favour shown to St. Paul may fairly be considered as due to the influence of the centurion Julius, from whom he had, from the first, received so many marks of courtesy. The Prefect of the Prætorium was the natural custodian of prisoners sent from the provinces, and about this time that office was filled by Burrus, the friend and colleague of Seneca. Before and after his time there were two prefects, and the way in which St. Luke speaks of “<span class= "ital">the </span>captain of the guard” may fairly be accepted as a note of time fixing the date of the Apostle’s arrival. The Praetorian camp lay to the north-east of the city, outside the Porta Viminalis. The manner in which St. Luke speaks of his “dwelling by himself” implies that he went at once, instead of accepting the hospitality of any friends, into a hired apartment. Tradition points to the vestibule of, the Church of Santa Maria, at the junction of the Via Lata and the Corso, as the site of his dwelling; but it has been urged by Dr. Philip, at present working as a missionary in the Ghetto at Rome, in a pamphlet, <span class= "ital">On the Ghetto </span>(Rome, 1874), that this site, forming part of the old Flaminian Way, was then occupied by arches and public buildings, and that it was far more probable that he would fix his quarters near those of own countrymen. He adds that a local tradition points to No. 2 in the Via Stringhari, just outside the modern Ghetto, as having been St. Paul’s dwelling-place, but does not give any documentary evidence as to its nature or the date to which it can be traced back.<p><span class= "bld">With a soldier that kept him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">with the soldier. </span>The arrangement was technically known as a <span class= "ital">custodia libera. </span>The prisoner, however, was fastened by a chain to the soldier who kept guard over him, and so the Apostle speaks of his “chain” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>), of his being a “prisoner” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm" title="For this cause I Paul, the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles,">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm" title="I therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation with which you are called,">Ephesians 4:1</a>), an ambassador in <span class= "ital">chains </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-20.htm" title="For which I am an ambassador in bonds: that therein I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak.">Ephesians 6:20</a>), of his “bonds” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Philippians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Philippians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-18.htm" title=" The salutation by the hand of me Paul. Remember my bonds. Grace be with you. Amen.">Colossians 4:18</a>). It was almost a matter of course that the guard would from time to time be relieved, and so the Apostle’s bonds, and the story of his sufferings, and what had brought them on him, would be known throughout the whole Prætorian camp from which the soldiers came. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Philippians 1:13</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard </span>— Or prefect of the pretorian band, according to his commission. It was customary for prisoners who were brought to Rome, to be delivered to this officer, who had the charge of the state prisoners. The person who now held this office was the noted Afranius Burrhus. <span class="ital">But Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him </span>— Dr. Lardner proves, from Ulpian, that the proconsul was to judge whether a person, under accusation, was to be thrown into prison, or delivered to a soldier to be guarded, or committed to sureties, or trusted on his parole of honour. The humanity with which Julius all along treated the apostle merits particular attention. At Sidon he allowed him to go ashore to visit his Christian friends. And, when they were shipwrecked on the island of Melita, he kept the soldiers from killing the prisoners that he might save Paul. And because some brethren at Puteoli wished Paul to remain with them a week, he was so good as to grant their desire. And, as this worthy person is said by Luke to have courteously entreated Paul through the whole of the voyage, he may have bestowed on him favours which are not particularly mentioned. Those, however, which are mentioned deserve notice, as proofs of esteem and love from a heathen very honourable to the apostle. Julius’s regard for Paul was founded, at first, on the favourable opinion which Festus, Agrippa, and the tribunes, had formed of his cause, and which no doubt, they made known to Julius before he left Cesarea. But his esteem of the apostle must have increased by what he himself observed in the course of their acquaintance. For, in his conversation, Paul expressed such just views of God and religion, and of the duties of morality; and, in his actions, showed such benevolence to mankind, and such a concern for their real interest, as could not fail to endear him to so great a friend to virtue, as this centurion seems to have been. Besides, if Paul was represented to Julius as one who could work miracles, that circumstance alone would induce him to treat him with great respect. And more especially, when he became himself a witness to the accomplishment of Paul’s prediction concerning their shipwreck, and to the miraculous cures which he performed on the sick, in the island of Melita. Julius, therefore, having so great a friendship for Paul, and, it may be, a favourable opinion of the Christian doctrine, we may suppose that when he delivered the prisoners to Afranius Burrhus, who was then pretorian prefect, he did justice to Paul by representing him, not only as entirely innocent of any real crime, but as a man of singular probity, who was highly favoured of God, and endowed with extraordinary powers. To this representation, as well as to Festus’s letter, the apostle was probably indebted for the indulgence which was shown him immediately on his arrival at Rome. For he was not shut up in a common jail, with the other prisoners, but from the very first was allowed to dwell in his own hired house, with a soldier, who kept him by means of a chain fastened to his right wrist, and to the soldier’s left arm. This is <span class="ital">the chain </span>of which Paul so often speaks in his epistles, calling it <span class="ital">his bonds; </span>and which he showed to the Jews, when they came to him on the third day after his arrival. Who, that had met Paul in these bonds, would have guessed at his real character, and have imagined him to have been one of the most upright, benevolent, and generous of mankind? Yet such the apostle undoubtedly was. See Macknight and Doddridge.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The captain of the guard - The commander of the Praetorian cohort, or guard. The custom was, that those who were sent from the provinces to Rome for trial were delivered to the custody of this guard. The name of the prefect or captain of the guard at this time was Burrhus Afranius (Tacitus, History, 12, 42, 1).<p>But Paul was suffered ... - Evidently by the permission of the centurion, whose favor he had so much conciliated on the voyage. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-43.htm">Acts 27:43</a>.<p>With a soldier that kept him - That is, in the custody of a soldier to whom he was chained, and who, of course, constantly attended him.

Ordinarily there were two such prefects; but from A.D. 51 to 62, one distinguished general&#8212;Burrus Aframus, who had been Nero's tutor&#8212;held that office; and as our historian speaks of "the captain," as if there were but one, it is thought that this fixes the apostle's arrival at Rome to be not later than the year 62 [Wies]. But even though there had been two when Paul arrived, he would be committed only to one of them, who would be "the captain" who got charge of him. (At most, therefore, this can furnish no more than confirmation to the chronological evidence otherwise obtained).<p>but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a&#8212;"the"<p>soldier that kept him&#8212;"guarded" him. (See on [2141]Ac 12:6). This privilege was allowed in the case of the better class of prisoners, not accused of any flagrant offense, on finding security&#8212;which in Paul's case would not be difficult among the Christians. The extension of this privilege to the apostle may have been due to the terms in which Festus wrote about him; but far more probably it was owing to the high terms in which Julius spoke of him, and his express intercession in his behalf. It was overruled, however, for giving the fullest scope to the labors of the apostle compatible with confinement at all. As the soldiers who kept him were relieved periodically, he would thus make the personal acquaintance of a great number of the Pr&aelig;torian guard; and if he had to appear before the Prefect from time to time, the truth might thus penetrate to those who surrounded the emperor, as we learn, from Php 1:12, 13, that it did.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The captain of the guard; </span> the <span class="ital">praefectus praetorio, </span> being commander-in-chief over the soldiers, and unto whom the prisoners of state were usually committed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Paul was suffered to dwell by himself; </span> God by this means giving Paul an opportunity to go abroad at his pleasure; though chained, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a></span>, yet he might preach the gospel, and that was not bound, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-9.htm" title="Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, even to bonds; but the word of God is not bound.">2 Timothy 2:9</a></span>.

It is striking that both before and after Burrus there were two “prefects,” Tac., <span class="ital">Ann.</span>, xii., 42, xiv., 51, whereas Luke writes <span class="greekheb">τῷ στρατ</span>., “the captain of the guard”; but on the other hand we can scarcely draw any decisive argument from this, because the writer may refer merely to the “prefect” in charge of this particular case, whether he had a colleague or not.—<span class="greekheb">καθʼ ἑαυτόν</span>, see critical note for addition in [432] text. Not only the goodwill of the centurion, and the services which St. Paul had rendered, but also the terms in which Festus had reported the case in the <span class="ital">elogium</span>, would combine to secure this favour. The words do not imply that Paul was kept in prison in the camp apart from the other prisoners, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-23.htm" title="And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into his lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and out of the prophets, from morning till evening.">Acts 28:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-30.htm" title="And Paul dwelled two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in to him,">Acts 28:30</a>, that he was allowed to have a house or lodging in the city (Ramsay); he could scarcely have summoned the Jews to the camp, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-17.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together: and when they were come together, he said to them, Men and brothers, though I have committed nothing against the people, or customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.">Acts 28:17</a> (Bethge), see also Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Phil.</span>, p. 103.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ φυλάσσοντι αὐτὸν στρατ</span>.: <span class="ital">custodia militaris</span>, he was still bound to a soldier by a light chain, so that he could not go in and out as he pleased, but the form which his custody took has been well compared to that which Herod Agrippa underwent, who was confined at one time in Rome, Jos., <span class="ital">Ant.</span>, xviii., 6, 5, at first in the camp, and afterwards on the accession of Gaius in a house of his own, although still under military custody, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-27.htm" title="But after two years Porcius Festus came into Felix' room: and Felix, willing to show the Jews a pleasure, left Paul bound.">Acts 24:27</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[432] R(omana), in Blass, a first rough copy of St. Luke.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/acts/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">And when we came to Rome</span>] There was much that might have been said of this land journey from Puteoli to Rome, and the writer of the Acts was one of the fellow-travellers.

They are entirely independent of anything either in the Acts or the Epistles of St Paul, and it is not easy to understand why they should have been added to the original text. There is moreover such similarity between the ending of the first and last words in the clause, that the eye of an early scribe may have passed over from the one to the other, and thus omitted the clause, and in this way may have originated the text of the MSS. which leave the passage out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “Captain of the Guard” here alluded to was probably the “præfectus prætorio,” one of whose duties was to take charge of those persons from the provinces whose causes were to be brought before the Emperor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Paul was suffered to dwell</span> [<span class="ital">R.

And to this chain the Apostle often makes allusion in the Epistles (Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians and Philemon) written during this imprisonment. See also below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>. The frequent change of the person who guarded him would give the Apostle an opportunity of spreading the knowledge of his cause, and the message of the Gospel, very widely among the Prætorian guards who had him in charge, and many things would have been heard by them from the soldiers who had sailed with St Paul, which would make them ready to attend to the narrative of their prisoner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/28.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-16.htm" title="And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the guard: but Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him.">Acts 28:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῷ Παύλῳ</span>) A more recent transcriber has formed a neat paraphrase: <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἑκατόνταρχος παρέδωκε τοὺς δεσμίους τῷ στρατοπεδάρχῃ</span>· <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ Παύλῳ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.[157] What became of the other prisoners is of no interest to us.

There were usually two great officers so called, and it was their special duty to take charge of prisoners sent from the provinces to be tried at Rome. 'Vinctus mitti ad praefectos praetorii met debet" (Pliny, 'Epist.,' 10:65). It has been argued, from the mention of "the captain of the guard," that Paul's imprisonment must have occurred when Burrus was sole prefect, as related by Tacitus ('Annal.,' 12:42, 1), and that hence we get a precise date for it (so Wieseler, 'Chronologic de Apostolisch. Geshichte'). But this can hardly be depended upon. Luke might speak of "the prefect," meaning the one to whom the prisoners were actually committed, just as we might speak of a magistrate writing to "the secretary of state," or an ambassador calling upon "the secretary of state," the matter in hand determining which of the three secretaries we meant. <span class="cmt_word">With the soldier that guarded him</span>.
