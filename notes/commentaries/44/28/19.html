In his appeal he sought not to accuse his nation, but only to clear himself. True Christianity settles what is of common concern to all mankind, and is not built upon narrow opinions and private interests. It aims at no worldly benefit or advantage, but all its gains are spiritual and eternal. It is, and always has been, the lot of Christ's holy religion, to be every where spoken against. Look through every town and village where Christ is exalted as the only Saviour of mankind, and where the people are called to follow him in newness of life, and we see those who give themselves up to Christ, still called a sect, a party, and reproached. And this is the treatment they are sure to receive, so long as there shall continue an ungodly man upon earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Jews spake against it - Against my being set at liberty.<p>I was constrained - By a regard to my own safety and character.<p>To appeal unto Caesar - See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-11.htm">Acts 25:11</a>.<p>Not that I had aught ... - I did it for my own preservation and safety, not that I wished to accuse my countrymen.

I was constrained to appeal &#8230; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of&#8212;"I am here not as their accuser, but as my own defender, and this not of choice but necessity." His object in alluding thus gently to the treatment he had received from the Jews was plainly to avoid whatever might irritate his visitors at the first; especially as he was not aware whether any or what information against him had reached their community.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Jews spake against it; </span> the Jews used all their oratory and interest against Paul, both before Felix and Festus.

He knew how many things his fellow-countrymen had suffered at the hands of the Roman power, and he did not wish in any way to bring on them any more trouble. He therefore explains that he had taken the course of appealing to Cæsar only because he saw no other means of obtaining his release. If that were secured he wished to lay no charge at the door of his accusers or their brethren in Rome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/28.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-19.htm" title="But when the Jews spoke against it, I was constrained to appeal to Caesar; not that I had ought to accuse my nation of.">Acts 28:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀντιλεγόντων</span>, <span class="ital">when</span> the Jews <span class="ital">spake against</span> it) He speaks mildly: for they had tried, by a plot for murdering Paul, to put an end to his speaking in Palestine.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">When the Jews spake against it</span>. This is a detail not expressly mentioned in the direct narrative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25.htm">Acts 25</a>, but which makes that narrative clearer. It shows us that Festus's proposal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-9.htm">Acts 25:9</a> was made in consequence of the opposition of the Jews to the acquittal which he was disposed to pronounce. <span class="cmt_word">I was constrained to appeal</span>. Nothing can be more delicate, more conciliatory, or more truly patriotic than Paul's manner of addressing the Jews. Himself a Hebrew of the Hebrews, devoted to his kinsmen according to the flesh, never even putting forward his own privilege as a Roman citizen till the last necessity, he shows himself the constant friend of his own people in spite of all their ill usage. Undazzled by the splendor of Rome and the power of the Roman people, his heart is with his own despised nation, "that they might be saved." He wishes to he well with them; he wants them to understand his position; he speaks to them as a kinsman and a brother. His appeal to Caesar had been of necessity - to save his life. But he was not going to accuse his brethren before the dominant race. His first desire was that they should be his friends, and share with him the hope of the gospel of Christ. </body></html>
