The Fast, falling on the 10th of Tisri, which has been calculated as falling in that year on September 24th, was passed, we are not told how long, when the ship left the Fair Havens (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>).

Three months from this carries us to the beginning of February. This was earlier than that usually fixed for the general navigation of the Mediterranean (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-9.htm" title="Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the fast was now already past, Paul admonished them,">Acts 27:9</a>), but the officers and the crew of the Alexandrian ship were naturally anxious to take the earliest opportunity for pressing on to their destination. The fact that the latter had wintered in the island is obviously in favour of the identification of Melita with Malta, which lay on the usual line of the voyage from Alexandria to Italy, while Meleda was altogether out of the way.<p><span class= "bld">Whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">the Dioscuri, </span>the two sons of Zeus and Leda, who were regarded as the guardian deities of sailors. So Horace (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 3, 2) speaks of the <span class= "ital">“fratres Helenœ, lucida sidera</span>” (“brothers of Helen, beaming stars”), and (<span class= "ital">Od.</span> i. 12, 25) of the “<span class= "ital">puerosque Ledce</span>” (“the children of Leda”), whose bright star shines propitiously on sailors. In Greek mythology, Zeus had rewarded their brotherly devotion by placing them among the stars as the <span class= "ital">Gemini, </span>which were connected with the month of May in the signs of the Zodiac, and Poseidon (= Neptune) had given them power over the winds and waves that they might assist the shipwrecked. So in the <span class= "ital">Helena</span> of Euripides they appear, in 1550–60, as promising a fair wind and a safe voyage. The figure-heads of the Greek and Roman ships were commonly placed both at the prow and the stern.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-11.htm" title="And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.">Acts 28:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">And after three months </span>— The three winter months, which time Paul doubtless improved, as a true labourer in the Lord’s vineyard. <span class="ital">We departed in a ship of Alexandria, whose sign was Castor and Pollux </span>— Two fabulous semi-deities of the Greeks and Romans, who were said to be the sons of Jupiter and Leda, and, being translated to the heavens, formed the constellation called <span class="ital">Gemini, </span>or <span class="ital">the Twins, </span>a constellation which, when it appeared, was deemed propitious to mariners. And, as it was the custom of the ancients to have images of their gods, both on the head and stern of their ships, this Alexandrian ship had these, either on her prow or stern. And yet, in a ship having such an idolatrous image, Paul did not refuse to sail, considering it as being only the name of the ship.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:11-16 The common events of travelling are seldom worthy of being told; but the comfort of communion with the saints, and kindness shown by friends, deserve particular mention. The Christians at Rome were so far from being ashamed of Paul, or afraid of owning him, because he was a prisoner, that they were the more careful to show him respect. He had great comfort in this. And if our friends are kind to us, God puts it into their hearts, and we must give him the glory. When we see those even in strange places, who bear Christ's name, fear God, and serve him, we should lift up our hearts to heaven in thanksgiving. How many great men have made their entry into Rome, crowned and in triumph, who really were plagues to the world! But here a good man makes his entry into Rome, chained as a poor captive, who was a greater blessing to the world than any other merely a man. Is not this enough to put us for ever out of conceit with worldly favour? This may encourage God's prisoners, that he can give them favour in the eyes of those that carry them captives. When God does not soon deliver his people out of bondage, yet makes it easy to them, or them easy under it, they have reason to be thankful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And after three months - Probably they remained there so long because there was no favorable opportunity for them to go to Rome.

Castor and Pollux were best known as the tutelary gods of sailors, and probably at this date they were both the <span class="ital">insigne</span> and the <span class="ital">tutela</span> of the ship. St. Cyril of Alexandria tells us that it was always the Alexandrian method to ornament each side of the prow with the figures of deities, probably in this case Castor and Pollux, one on each side of the vessel; and we may further note that the twin brothers were specially honoured in the district of Cyrenaica, not far from Alexandria (<span class="ital">Schol.</span>, Pind., <span class="ital">Pyth.</span>, v., 6).

The mention of the ship’s sign shows the minuteness of the information of an eyewitness, and the fact that an Alexandrian ship thus wintered in the island is a strong piece of incidental evidence in favour of the identification of the island with Malta; the latter would be a natural harbour for a ship of Alexandria on the way to Italy, but Meleda would be altogether out of the course (see J.

And in Ode 12:27, etc., he describes the subsidence of the storm, and the calming of the waves, at the appearance of the twin stars, of Leda's sons.

Ovid tells us that Minerva was the <span class="accented">tutela</span> of the ship in which he sailed, and that her painted helmet gave it its name ('Trist.,' 1 9:1), Galea, or the like.
