It lies on the surface that those to whom the conspirators went were the Sadducean party in the Council, not the more moderate and cautious Pharisees.<p><span class= "bld">We have bound ourselves under a great curse.</span>—The Greek follows the Hebrew idiom in expressing intensity by the reduplication of the leading word. laterally, <span class= "ital">We have anathematised ourselves with an anathema.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-14.htm" title="And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will eat nothing until we have slain Paul....">Acts 23:14-15</a>. </span><span class="ital">And they came to the chief priests and elders </span>— Who were of the sect of the Sadducees, and Paul’s greatest enemies, telling them what they had done; and desiring them to ask <span class="ital">the chief captain </span>to <span class="ital">bring </span>Paul <span class="ital">down </span>to <span class="ital">the council </span>on the <span class="ital">morrow, </span>as if they wished to <span class="ital">inquire something more perfectly concerning him, and we, </span>(said they,) <span class="ital">or ever he come near, are ready to kill him </span>— And we will manage the attack in such a manner, that you shall not appear at all concerned in it; nor have any alarm about the matter, till you hear that he is actually dead. Josephus mentions a case not much unlike this, of some that bound themselves with an oath to kill Herod; in which they gloried as a laudable intention, because he had violated the ancient customs of their nation. It is no wonder, therefore, that these Jews should make no scruple of acquainting the chief priests and elders with their conspiracy against the life of Paul; who, indeed, were so far from blaming them for it, that not long after they renewed the same design themselves.

Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they came ... - Probably by a deputation.<p>To the chief priests and elders - The members of the Great Council, or Sanhedrin.

And they could not but have been guilty of the blood of St. Paul, had it been shed, who by encouraging the design became accessory unto it. But they had drank blood very largely before now; viz. the blood of St. Stephen, and the blood of our Saviour; and it is no wonder that they thirst for more: such wild beasts, (rather than men), when they have once tasted of blood, are never satisfied with it. But at what a low ebb was religion, when the chief priests themselves combine with assassins! <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/acts/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they came to the chief priests, and elders,....

The conspirators may have been instigated by the knowledge that the Sanhedrim could no longer inflict capital punishment, and from despair of obtaining the sanction of the Roman authorities for violence against Paul. It is quite certain that sentence of death must at all events be ratified by the procurator. Another serious restriction of the Jewish powers lay in the fact that the Roman authorities could step in at any moment and take the initiative, as in the case of Paul. Moreover the incidents before us illustrate the strange fact that even the chiliarch of the Roman force stationed in Jerusalem seems to be able to summon the Sanhedrim for the purpose of submitting to it any question upon which the Jewish law had to be learnt, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm" title="On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.">Acts 22:30</a>, Schürer, <span class="ital">Jewish People</span>, div. ii., vol. i., p. 188 ff., with which, however, should be compared O.
