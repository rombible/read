He had not seen it since he had stood there among Stephen’s accusers, a quarter of a century ago. Many changes, of course, had come about in that interval, but some of the faces were probably the same; and at all events the general aspect of the G<span class= "ital">azith, </span>or Hall of Meeting, on the south side of the Temple, with its circular benches must have remained the same.<p><span class= "bld">I have lived in all good conscience . . .</span>—The verb for “I have lived” means literally, <span class= "ital">I have used my citizenship.</span> It had ceased, however, to have this sharply defined meaning (see Note on the kindred substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm" title="For our conversation is in heaven; from where also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ:">Philippians 3:20</a>), and had come to be used of the whole course of a man’s social conduct. Perhaps <span class= "ital">My mode of life has been in all good conscience, </span>would be the nearest English equivalent. The reference to “conscience” may be noted as eminently characteristic of St. Paul. So we find him saying of himself that he had all his life served God with “a pure conscience” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2Timothy 1:3</a>); that a “good conscience” is the end of the commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1Timothy 1:5</a>); or, again, recognising the power of conscience even among the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-15.htm" title="Which show the work of the law written in their hearts, their conscience also bearing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing or else excusing one another;)">Romans 2:15</a>). In the phrase “I know nothing by myself,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“I am conscious of no fault” (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1Corinthians 4:4</a>), we have a like reference to its authority. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-5.htm" title="Why you must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.">Romans 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm" title="Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:">1Corinthians 10:25</a>. And in all these passages he assigns to conscience its true functions with an exact precision. It is not an infallible guide and requires illumination, and therefore each man needs to pray for light, but it is never right to act against its dictates, and that which is objectively the better course is subjectively the worse, unless the man in his heart believes it to be the better.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day....">Acts 23:1-5</a></span>. <span class="ital">And Paul, earnestly beholding the council </span>— At whose bar he was placed; manifesting a clear conscience by his very countenance; and likewise waiting to see whether any of them was minded to ask him any question; <span class="ital">said, Men and brethren </span>— Though I am brought before you as a malefactor, to be examined and judged by you, I have the comfort of being conscious to myself that <span class="ital">I have lived in all good conscience before God — </span>The Searcher of hearts; <span class="ital">until this day </span>— Whatever men may think or say of me. He speaks chiefly of the time since he became a Christian. For none questioned him concerning what he had been before. And yet, even in his unconverted state, although he was in error, yet he had acted from conscience before God. <span class="ital">And the high-priest Ananias </span>— Conscious of his inveterate enmity to Paul, and of the steps he had openly taken for his destruction, thinking himself insulted by such a solemn declaration of his innocence; <span class="ital">commanded them that stood by him </span>— At the bar; <span class="ital">to smite him on the mouth — </span>For what he represented as a most insolent assertion; which was accordingly done. <span class="ital">Then said Paul </span>— Being carried away by a sudden and prophetic impulse; <span class="ital">God, </span><span class="greekheb">τυπτειν σε μελλει</span>, <span class="ital">is about to smite thee, thou whited wall </span>— Fair without; full of dirt and rubbish within. And he might well be so termed, not only as he committed this outrage while gravely sitting on the tribunal of justice, but also as, at the same time that he stood high in the esteem of the citizens, he cruelly defrauded the priests of their legal subsistence, so that some of them even perished for want. And God did remarkably <span class="ital">smite </span>him; for about five years after this, his house being reduced to ashes, in a tumult begun by his own son, he was besieged in the royal palace; where, having hid himself in an old aqueduct, he was dragged out and miserably slain. <span class="ital">And they that stood by </span>— Being greatly offended; <span class="ital">said, Revilest thou God’s high-priest </span>— Dost thou, who pretendest to so much religion, presume impiously to revile the most sacred person in our nation, and consequently in the whole world? <span class="ital">Then said Paul, I wist not, brethren </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ουκ ηδει οτι εστιν αρχιερευς</span>, <span class="ital">I knew not, </span>or, <span class="ital">had not known; that he is the high-priest </span>— That is, (as many understand him,) he did not advert to it, in the prophetic transport of his mind, that Ananias was the high-priest. But he does not say that his not adverting to it proceeded from the power of the Spirit coming upon him, as knowing that they were not able to bear it. But is it not more probable that his positive assertion here was the exact truth; and that, in fact, he did not know Ananias to be the high-priest? For, as Dr. Macknight justly observes, “Both the Roman governors and the Jewish princes had, for some time past, been in use to sell the high-priesthood to the best bidder; and sometimes to depose the person in office, that they might have it to sell anew. Wherefore, as Paul was but lately come from Greece, after five years’ absence, he may very well be supposed to have been ignorant of Ananias’s dignity, notwithstanding he might know him personally. It is alleged, indeed, that by his dress and seat in the council, Paul might have known Ananias to be the high-priest. But that does not seem probable; because, having looked steadfastly on the council at his first coming in, he would, by such an excuse, have exposed himself to ridicule, if Ananias could have been known to be the high-priest, either by his dress, or by his seat in the council.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:1-5 See here the character of an honest man. He sets God before him, and lives as in his sight. He makes conscience of what he says and does, and, according to the best of his knowledge, he keeps from whatever is evil, and cleaves to what is good. He is conscientious in all his words and conduct. Those who thus live before God, may, like Paul, have confidence both toward God and man. Though the answer of Paul contained a just rebuke and prediction, he seems to have been too angry at the treatment he received in uttering them. Great men may be told of their faults, and public complaints may be made in a proper manner; but the law of God requires respect for those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Paul, earnestly beholding - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  atenisas. Fixing his eyes intently on the council. The word denotes "a fixed and earnest gazing; a close observation." See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>. Compare the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4</a>. Paul would naturally look with a keen and attentive observation on the council. He was arraigned before them, and he would naturally observe the appearance, and endeavor to ascertain the character of his judges. Besides, it was by this council that he had been formerly commissioned to persecute the Christians, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-1.htm">Acts 9:1-2</a>. He had not seen them since that commission was given. He would naturally, therefore, regard them with an attentive eye. The result shows, also, that he looked at them to see what was the character of the men there assembled, and what was the proportion of Pharisees and Sadducees, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>.<p>The council - Greek: the Sanhedrin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm">Acts 22:30</a>. It was the great council, composed of seventy elders, to whom was entrusted the affairs of the nation. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-4.htm">Matthew 1:4</a>.<p>Men and brethren - Greek: "Men, brethren"; the usual form of beginning an address among the Jews. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-29.htm">Acts 2:29</a>. He addressed them still as his brethren.<p>I have lived in all good conscience - I have conducted myself so as to maintain a good conscience. I have done what I believed to be right. This was a bold declaration, after the tumult, and charges, and accusations of the previous day <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/22.htm">Acts 22</a>; and yet it was strictly true. His persecutions of the Christians had been conducted conscientiously, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9</a>, "I verily thought with myself," says he, "that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth." Of his conscientiousness and fidelity in their service they could bear witness. Of his conscientiousness since, he could make a similar declaration. He doubtless meant to say that as he had been conscientious in persecution, so he had been in his conversion and in his subsequent course. And as they knew that his former life had been with a good conscience, they ought to presume that he had maintained the same character still. This was a remarkably bold appeal to be made by an accused man, and it shows the strong consciousness which Paul had of his innocence. What would have been the drift of his discourse in proving this we can only Conjecture. He was interrupted <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm">Acts 23:2</a>; but there can be no doubt that he would have pursued such a course of argument as would tend to establish his innocence.<p>Before God - Greek: to God - &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;  to&#772; Theo&#772;. He had lived to God, or with reference to his commands, so as to keep a conscience pure in his sight. The same principle of conduct he states more at length in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; "And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward men."<p>Until this day - Including the time before his conversion to Christianity, and after. In both conditions he was conscientious; in one, conscientious in persecution and error, though he deemed it to be right; in the other, conscientious in the truth. The mere fact that a man is conscientious does not prove that he is right or innocent.

He had been sent to Rome by Quadratus, the predecessor of Felix, to answer for himself before the Emperor Claudius (<span class="ital">Antt</span>. xx. 6. 2, <span class="ital">Bell</span>. ii. 12. 6); he must not, however, have thereby lost his office, but must have continued in it after his return.

Against this view it is specially to be borne in mind, that the successor of Ananias was <span class="ital">Ishmael</span>, and not <span class="ital">Jonathan</span> (who had been at an earlier period high priest, Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xviii. 4. 3, 5. 3); for in the alleged probative passages (<span class="ital">Antt</span>. xx. 8. 5, <span class="ital">Bell</span>. ii. 13. 3), where the murder of the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεύς</span> Jonathan is recorded, this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΡΧΙΕΡ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> is to be taken in the well-known wider titular sense.

It is of course possible, as Chrysostom observes, that he did not wish to appear <span class="greekheb">εὐκαταφρόνητος</span> before the chiliarch.—<span class="greekheb">συνειδήσει</span>: the word occurs no less than thirty times in N.T., R.V., so also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm" title="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.">John 8:9</a>, but <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1 Corinthians 8:7</a>, <span class="greekheb">συνηθείᾳ</span>, R.V., and of these no less than twenty times in St. Paul’s Epistles, twice in Acts, on both occasions by St. Paul, three times in 1 Peter, and five times in Hebrews. It may therefore be almost reckoned as a Pauline word. It does not occur at all in the Gospels (but <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-9.htm" title="And they which heard it, being convicted by their own conscience, went out one by one, beginning at the oldest, even to the last: and Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the middle.">John 8:9</a>), but it need hardly be said that our Lord distinctly appeals to its sanction, although the word is never uttered by Him. The N.T. writers found the word ready to their use. In <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/17-10.htm" title="They died for fear, denying that they saw the air, which could of no side be avoided.">Wis 17:10</a> (11) we have the nearest anticipation of the Christian use of the word, whilst it must not be forgotten that it first appears at least in philosophical importance amongst the Stoics. (In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a> it is used but in a different sense, and in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/42-18.htm" title="He declareth the things that are past, and for to come, and revealeth the steps of hidden things.">Sir 42:18</a>, but in the latter case the reading is doubtful, and if the word is retained, it is only used in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/10-20.htm" title="Curse not the king, no not in your thought; and curse not the rich in your bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the voice, and that which has wings shall tell the matter.">Ecclesiastes 10:20</a>.) It is used by Chrysippus of Soli, or Tarsus, in Cilicia, Diog. Laert., vii., 8, but not perhaps with any higher meaning than self-consciousness. For the <span class="ital">alleged</span> earlier use of the word by Bias and Periander, and the remarkable parallel expression <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθὴ συνείδησις</span> attributed to the latter, see W.

To this latter expression Deissmann, <span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, i., p. 211, finds a parallel in the fragment of a letter dating about 164 B.C.

He very generally gives some word to indicate the gesture or look of the person who speaks. This verb is often rendered in A.V. “looking stedfastly” and that rendering the <span class="ital">Rev.

It is as though the Apostle would say, ‘You see me before you as though I were an offender, but personally I feel myself innocent.’ The verb is one which in profane authors signifies ‘to discharge the duties of a citizen.’ St Paul implies by its use that he has been obedient to God’s laws, as a good citizen would be to the laws of his country. So far as being devoted to God’s service, his whole life up to the present moment had been of one piece, it was only that his conscience had been enlightened, and so his behaviour had changed. He had at first lived as a conscientious and observant Jew, his conscience now approved his conduct as a Christian.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm" title="And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Men and brothers, I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day.">Acts 23:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀτενίσας</span>, <span class="ital">having earnestly fixed, his eyes upon</span>) with a countenance indicative of a good conscience; waiting also to see whether anyone of the chief priests was about to ask any question.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="ital">I</span>) By this protestation he gained his point, that no former act of his could be alleged as a charge against him, but that that truth which he was about to assert in the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>, might be brought forward as the one and only cause of his imprisonment: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm" title="Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.">Acts 24:21</a>.—<span class="greekheb">συνειδήσει</span>, <span class="ital">conscience</span>) ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>. Paul speaks especially of his state after conversion: for concerning his former state no one moved any controversy with him. And yet even in his former state, although he was labouring under error, he had obeyed conscience, and had not committed aught which could constitute him guilty before the bar of external justice. Now, since he has not cast away whatever of good he formerly had, but has received better goods, the light was pouring itself out of his present state into his former state.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span>, <span class="ital">before God</span>) although all men did not approve of it.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="accented">Looking steadfastly on</span> for <span class="accented">earnestly beholding</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">brethren</span> for <span class="accented">men and brethren</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">I have lived before God</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">I have lived</span>, etc., <span class="accented">before God</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Looking steadfastly</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-10.htm">Acts 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-4.htm">Acts 3:4, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-15.htm">Acts 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-55.htm">Acts 7:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-4.htm">Acts 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm">Acts 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-9.htm">Acts 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-9.htm">Acts 14:9</a>.
