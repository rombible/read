Yet the Lord readily disappoints the best concerted schemes of iniquity. Paul knew that the Divine providence acts by reasonable and prudent means; and that, if he neglected to use the means in his power, he could not expect God's providence to work on his behalf. He who will not help himself according to his means and power, has neither reason nor revelation to assure him that he shall receive help from God. Believing in the Lord, we and ours shall be kept from every evil work, and kept to his kingdom. Heavenly Father, give us by thy Holy Spirit, for Christ's sake, this precious faith.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Called one of the centurions - Who might at that time have had special charge of the castle, or been on guard. Paul had the most positive divine assurance that his life would be spared, and that he would yet see Rome; but he always understood the divine promises and purposes as being consistent with his own efforts, and with all proper measures of prudence and diligence in securing his own safety. He did not rest merely on the divine promises without any effort of his own, but he took encouragement from those promises to put forth his own exertions for security and for salvation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Then Paul called one of the centurions&#8212;Though divinely assured of safety, he never allows this to interfere with the duty he owed to his own life and the work he had yet to do.

For under this chief captain there must have been ten of them, if the company of which he was captain consisted of a thousand men, as his title chief captain or chiliarch imports; for a centurion was over an hundred men, as his title signifies; perhaps this might be the same, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-25.htm">Acts 22:25</a><p>and said, bring this young man to the chief captain: which was a very prudential step, not to let the centurion into the secret, but to desire him to introduce the young man to the chief captain; for had he trusted the centurion with it, he might not have acquainted his officer with it, but have informed the liers in wait of it: now though the apostle was assured by Christ that he should not die at Jerusalem, but should bear witness of him at Rome, and though he did not distrust the truth of Christ's words, but most firmly believed them; yet he thought it his duty to make use of the means, which providence had put in his way, for his preservation and safety; the Ethiopic version reads, "bring this young man by night to the chief captain"; that so he might not be seen, and observed to have carried any intelligence to him: <p>for he hath a certain thing to tell him; which was of some moment and importance, and proper for him to know. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Then Paul called one of the centurions unto <i>him</i>, and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.</span><p>(11) The wisdom of the Spirit must be joined with simplicity.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/acts/23.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-17.htm" title="Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Bring this young man to the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him.">Acts 23:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὸν νεανίαν τοῦτον</span>, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a> and previous note above.

As we know nothing of any kinsmen of St Paul being Christians we may perhaps be right in supposing that the young man was a Jew, present in Jerusalem on account of the feast, and that he had heard among the Jewish population about the uproar, and the undertaking of the would-be assassins. In his interview with the chief captain it is clear that he was prepared with evidence which was convincing to that officer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-17.htm" title="Then Paul called one of the centurions to him, and said, Bring this young man to the chief captain: for he has a certain thing to tell him.">Acts 23:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἕνα</span>) <span class="ital">one</span>: for there were several.—<span class="greekheb">χιλίαρχον</span>, <span class="ital">the tribune</span> or <span class="ital">chief captain</span>) It was safer to tell the chief captain himself.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/acts/23.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="accented">- And</span> for <span class="accented">then</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">called unto him one</span>, etc., for <span class="accented">called</span> one, etc., <span class="accented">unto him</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">something</span> for <span class="accented">a certain thing</span>, A.V. </body></html>
