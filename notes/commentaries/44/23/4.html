He sets God before him, and lives as in his sight. He makes conscience of what he says and does, and, according to the best of his knowledge, he keeps from whatever is evil, and cleaves to what is good. He is conscientious in all his words and conduct. Those who thus live before God, may, like Paul, have confidence both toward God and man. Though the answer of Paul contained a just rebuke and prediction, he seems to have been too angry at the treatment he received in uttering them. Great men may be told of their faults, and public complaints may be made in a proper manner; but the law of God requires respect for those in authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Revilest thou ... - Dost thou reproach or abuse the high priest of God? is remarkable that they, who knew that he was not the high priest, should have offered this language.

It is absolutely incredible that Paul was <span class="ital">really</span> ignorant of this, as Chrysostom,[144] Oecumenius, Lyra, Beza, Clarius, Cornelius a Lapide, Calovius, Deyling, Wolf, Michaelis, Sepp, and others (comp. also Ewald, Holtzmann, p. 684, Trip) assume under various modifications. For, although after so long an absence from Jerusalem he might not have known the person of the high priest (whose office at that time frequently changed its occupants) by sight, yet he was much too familiar with the arrangements of the Sanhedrim not to have known the high priest by his very activity in directing it, by his seat, by his official dress, etc. The contrary would only be credible in the event of Ananias not having been the real high priest, or of a vacancy in the office having at that time taken place (but see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-2.htm" title="And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.">Acts 23:2</a>), or of such a vacancy having been erroneously assumed by the apostle,[145] or of the sitting having been an irregular one,—not at least superintended by the high priest, and perhaps not held in the usual council-chamber,—which, however, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-30.htm" title="On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.">Acts 22:30</a>, is the less to be assumed, seeing that the assembly, expressly commanded by the tribune, and at which he himself was present (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-10.htm" title="And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring him into the castle.">Acts 23:10</a>), was certainly opened in proper form, and was only afterwards thrown into confusion by the further sagacious conduct of the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a> ff.). Entirely in keeping, on the other hand, with the irritated frame of Paul, is the <span class="ital">ironical</span> mode of taking it (<span class="greekheb">τινές</span> already in Chrysostom, further, Calvin, Camerarius, Lorinus in Calovius, Marnixius in Wolf, Thiess, Heinrichs; comp. also Grotius), according to which he bitterly enough (and <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span> makes the irony only the more sharp) veils in these words the thought: “a man, who shows himself so unholy and vulgar, I could not at all regard as the high priest.” Comp. Erasmus.[146] What an appropriate and cutting defence against the reproach, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-4.htm" title="And they that stood by said, Revile you God's high priest?">Acts 23:4</a>! It implies that he was obliged to regard an <span class="greekheb">ἀρχιερεύς</span>, who had acted so unworthily, as an <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἀρχιερεύς</span> (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/2_maccabees/4-13.htm" title="Now such was the height of Greek fashions, and increase of heathenish manners, through the exceeding profaneness of Jason, that ungodly wretch, and no high priest;">2Ma 4:13</a>). Others, against linguistic usage (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-18.htm" title="Till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.">Acts 7:18</a>), have endeavoured to alter the meaning of <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ᾔδειν</span>, either: <span class="ital">non agnosco</span> (so, with various suggestions, Cyprian, Augustine, Beda, Piscator, Lightfoot, Keuchen, and others), or <span class="ital">non reputabam</span> (so Simon Episcopius, Limborch, Wetstein, Bengel, Morus, Stolz, Kuinoel, Olshausen, and others, also Neander), so that Paul would thus confess that his conduct was rash. This confession would be a foolish one, inconsistent with the strong and clear mind of the apostle in a critical situation, and simply compromising him. Baumgarten has the correct view, but will not admit the irony. But this <span class="ital">must</span> be admitted, as Paul does not say <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἔγνων</span>, or the like; and there exists a <span class="ital">holy</span> irony. Lange, <span class="ital">apost. Zeitalt</span>. II. p. 314, imports ideas into the passage, and twists it thus: “Just because it is written, Thou shalt not curse the ruler of thy people, <span class="ital">and</span> YE <span class="ital">have cursed the high priest of our people</span> (Christ), for that reason I knew not that this is a high priest.” Zeller understands the words (left by de Wette without definite explanation) as an actual <span class="ital">untruth</span>, which, however, is only put into the mouth of the apostle by the <span class="ital">narrator</span>. But such a fiction, which, according to the naked meaning of the words, would have put a <span class="ital">lie</span> into the mouth of the holy apostle, is least of all to be imputed to a <span class="ital">maker</span> of history. The <span class="ital">exceptionableness</span> of the expression helps to warrant the certainty of its <span class="ital">originality</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γέγραπται γάρ</span>] gives the reason of <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ᾔδειν</span>. In consequence, namely, of the scriptural prohibition quoted, Paul would not have spoken <span class="greekheb">κακῶς</span> against the high priest, had not the case of the <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ᾔδειν</span> occurred (by the conduct of the man!). The passage itself is <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm" title="You shall not revile the gods, nor curse the ruler of your people.">Exodus 22:28</a>, closely after the LXX.: <span class="ital">a ruler of thy people thou shalt</span> (future, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-21.htm" title="And she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.">Matthew 1:21</a>) <span class="ital">not revile</span> = <span class="greekheb">κακολογεῖν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>.
