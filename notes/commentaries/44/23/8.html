Their denial of the existence of angels and spirits seems at first inconsistent with the known facts that they acknowledged the divine authority of the Pentateuch, which contains so many narratives of angelophanies, and were more severe than others in their administration of the Law. The great body of the higher priestly class were, we know, mere Sadducees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-17.htm" title="Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, (which is the sect of the Sadducees,) and were filled with indignation,">Acts 5:17</a>); and what, on their principles, was the meaning of the Temple ritual? They were, in fact, carried along by one of the great waves of thought which were then passing over the ancient world, and were Epicureans and Materialists without knowing it, just as the Pharisees were, even to the eye of a writer like Josephus (<span class= "ital">Life, c.</span> 3), the counterpart of the Stoics. For them the “angels” of the Pentateuch were not distinct beings, but evanescent manifestations of the divine glory.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:6-11 The Pharisees were correct in the faith of the Jewish church. The Sadducees were no friends to the Scripture or Divine revelation; they denied a future state; they had neither hope of eternal happiness, nor dread of eternal misery. When called in question for his being a Christian, Paul might truly say he was called in question for the hope of the resurrection of the dead. It was justifiable in him, by this profession of his opinion on that disputed point, to draw off the Pharisees from persecuting him, and to lead them to protect him from this unlawful violence. How easily can God defend his own cause! Though the Jews seemed to be perfectly agreed in their conspiracy against religion, yet they were influenced by very different motives. There is no true friendship among the wicked, and in a moment, and with the utmost ease, God can turn their union into open enmity. Divine consolations stood Paul in the most stead; the chief captain rescued him out of the hands of cruel men, but the event he could not tell. Whoever is against us, we need not fear, if the Lord stand by us. It is the will of Christ, that his servants who are faithful, should be always cheerful. He might think he should never see Rome; but God tells him, even in that he should be gratified, since he desired to go there only for the honour of Christ, and to do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Sadducees say - They believe.<p>No resurrection - Of the dead. By this doctrine they also understood that there was no future state, and that the soul did not exist after death. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm">Matthew 22:23</a>.<p>Neither angel - That there are no angels. They deny the existence of good or bad angels. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>.<p>Nor spirit - Nor soul. That there is nothing but matter. They were materialists, and supposed that all the operations which we ascribe to mind could be traced to some modification of matter. The Sadducees, says Josephus (Jewish Wars, book ii. chapter 8, section 14), "take away the belief of the immortal duration of the soul, and the punishments and rewards in Hades." "The doctrine of the Sadducees is this," says he (Antiq., book 18, chapter 1, section 4), "that souls die with the bodies." The opinion that the soul is material, and that there is nothing but matter in the universe, has been held by many philosophers, ancient and modern, as well as by the Sadducees.<p>Confess both - Acknowledge, or receive both as true; that is, that there is a future state, and that there are spirits distinct from matter, as angels, and the disembodied souls of people. The two points in dispute were:<p>(1) Whether the dead would be raised and exist in a future state; and,<p>(2) Whether mind was distinct from matter. The Sadducees denied both, and the Pharisees believed both. Their belief of the Latter point was, that spirits existed in two forms - that of angels, and that of souls of people distinct from the body. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the Sadducees say &#8230; there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit&#8212;(See on [2099]Lu 20:37).<p>the scribes &#8230; of the Pharisees' part &#8230; strove, saying, We find no evil in this man, but&#8212;as to those startling things which he brings to our ears.<p>if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him&#8212;referring, perhaps, to his trance in the temple, of which he had told them (Ac 22:17). They put this favorable construction upon his proceedings for no other reason than that they had found him one of their own party. They care not to inquire into the truth of what he alleged, over and above their opinions, but only to explain it away as something not worth raising a noise about. (The following words, "Let us not fight against God," seem not to belong to the original text, and perhaps are from Ac 5:39. In this case, either the meaning is, "If he has had some divine communication, what of that?" or, the conclusion of the sentence may have been drowned in the hubbub, which Ac 23:10 shows to have been intense).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/acts/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Sadducees say that there is no resurrection; </span> against this our Saviour argued, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm" title="The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,">Matthew 22:23</a></span>, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither angel; </span> it seems strange that they should deny that there were angels, whereas they owned the Pentateuch, or five books of Moses, in which mention is made frequently of angels: but it seems that they understood those places allegorically, either for good instincts, or apparitions caused by God to manifest his mind by them unto men, wresting those places to their own destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor spirit; </span> they denied the existence of the soul of man, as different from the crasis and temperament of his body; and therefore believed that the soul perished with the body.

And, according to the Talmudic (y) writers, they denied that there was any other world than this: <p>but the Pharisees confess both; the resurrection of the dead, and that there are spirits, both angels and the souls of men, which are immortal.

Hence <span class="greekheb">μηδέ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἄγγελ</span>. is to be defended, and not (in opposition to Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Marc</span>. p. 158, and Lachmann) to be changed into <span class="greekheb">μήτε</span>.

In the certainly very important codd.

To this category of <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα</span>, denied by them, belonged also the spirits of the departed; for they held the soul to be a refined matter, which perished (<span class="greekheb">συναφανίσαι</span>) with the body (Joseph. Antt. xviii. 1. 4, Bell. ii. 8. 14). But it is arbitrary, with Bengel, Kuinoel, and many others, to understand under <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> anima defuncti exclusively.

As we meet with them in the New Testament, they are mainly members of the priestly order, and appear to have accepted only the written Law, as distinct from tradition, yet in spite of the mention of angels in the Pentateuch they appear to have explained the language in such wise as to identify these angelic appearances with some manifestation of the divine glory, and thus to have come to deny the existence of any spiritual beings distinct from God Himself.
