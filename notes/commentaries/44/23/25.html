The natural abilities and moral virtues of the heathens often have been employed to protect his persecuted servants. Even the men of the world can discern between the conscientious conduct of upright believers, and the zeal of false professors, though they disregard or understand not their doctrinal principles. All hearts are in God's hand, and those are blessed who put their trust in him, and commit their ways unto him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And provide them beasts - One for Paul, and one for each of his attendants. The word translated "beasts" &#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;  kte&#772;ne&#772; is of a general character, and may be applied either to horses, camels, or donkeys. The latter were most commonly employed in Judea.<p>Unto Felix the governor - The governor of Judea. His place of residence was Caesarea, about 60 miles from Jerusalem. See the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-40.htm">Acts 8:40</a>. His name was Antonius Felix. He was a freedman of Antonia, the mother of the Emperor Claudius. He was high in the favor of Claudius, and was made by him governor of Judea. Josephus calls him Claudius Felix. He had married three wives in succession that were of royal families, one of whom was Drusilla, afterward mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/24-24.htm">Acts 24:24</a>, who was sister to King Agrippa. Tacitus (History, v. 9) says that he governed with all the authority of a king, and the baseness and insolence of a slave. "He was an unrighteous governor, a base, mercenary, and bad man" (Clarke). See his character further described in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-25.htm">Acts 24:25</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. beasts &#8230; set Paul on&#8212;as relays, and to carry baggage.<p>unto Felix, the governor&#8212;the procurator.
