Whether they sat in groups on different sides, after the manner of the Government and Opposition benches in the House of Commons, or whether St. Paul recognised the faces of individual teachers of each sect with whom he had formerly been acquainted, we have no <span class= "ital">data</span> for deciding.<p><span class= "bld">I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee.</span>—It is natural, from one point of view, to dwell chiefly on the tact of the Apostle. He seems to be acting, consciously or unconsciously, on the principle <span class= "ital">divide et impera, </span>to win over to his side a party who would otherwise have been his enemies. With this there comes, it may be, a half-doubt whether the policy thus adopted was altogether truthful. Was St. Paul at that time really a Pharisee? Was he not, as following in his Master’s footsteps, the sworn foe of Pharisaism? The answer to that question, which obviously ought to be answered and not suppressed, is that all parties have their good and bad sides, and that those whom the rank and file of a party most revile may be the most effective witnesses for the truths on which the existence of the party rests. The true leaders of the Pharisees had given a prominence to the doctrine of the Resurrection which it had never had before. They taught an ethical rather than a sacrificial religion. Many of them had been, like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathæa, secret disciples of our Lord. At this very time there were many avowed Pharisees among the members of the Christian Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>). St. Paul, therefore, could not be charged with any <span class= "ital">suppressio veri</span> in calling himself a Pharisee. It did not involve even a tacit disclaimer of his faith in Christ. It was rather as though he said, “I am one with you in all that is truest in your creed. I invite you to listen and see whether what I now proclaim to you is not the crown and completion of all your hopes and yearnings. Is not the resurrection of Jesus the one thing needed for a proof of that hope of the resurrection of the dead of which you and your fathers have been witnesses?”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/acts/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question....">Acts 23:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">But when Paul perceived </span>— <span class="greekheb">Γνους δε ο Παυλος</span>, <span class="ital">Paul knowing, </span>in consequence of his being personally acquainted with many whom he saw sitting round; <span class="ital">that one part </span>of the council <span class="ital">were Pharisees, and the other Sadducees, cried out, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee</span> — I am such both by birth and education, as also by my own free choice, having voluntarily attached myself to that sect: <span class="ital">of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question </span>— Meaning, that he was brought before them as a criminal for preaching the resurrection of Jesus from the dead, as a proof of the resurrection of all the dead at the last day. Certainly this was a principal part (though not the whole) of the truth, since the chief thing which enraged the Sadducees against Christianity, was the demonstration it gave to the doctrine of a resurrection, which they so eagerly opposed. <span class="ital">When he had so said, there arose a dissension </span>— A disagreement and contention producing a separation between the Pharisees and Sadducees, several persons of each sect becoming warm in the debate. <span class="ital">For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection </span>— Of the dead.

And with regard to their denying the existence of spirits, the meaning probably is, not that they denied God to be a spirit, or that there was any spirit in man, but, as Josephus testifies, they denied, <span class="greekheb">της ψυχης την διαμονην</span>, <span class="ital">the permanency of the soul after death, </span>or, that any spirits existed in a state of separation from men’s bodies. <span class="ital">But the Pharisees confess both </span>— Both the resurrection and the existence of angels and separate spirits.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/acts/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:6-11 The Pharisees were correct in the faith of the Jewish church. The Sadducees were no friends to the Scripture or Divine revelation; they denied a future state; they had neither hope of eternal happiness, nor dread of eternal misery. When called in question for his being a Christian, Paul might truly say he was called in question for the hope of the resurrection of the dead. It was justifiable in him, by this profession of his opinion on that disputed point, to draw off the Pharisees from persecuting him, and to lead them to protect him from this unlawful violence. How easily can God defend his own cause! Though the Jews seemed to be perfectly agreed in their conspiracy against religion, yet they were influenced by very different motives. There is no true friendship among the wicked, and in a moment, and with the utmost ease, God can turn their union into open enmity. Divine consolations stood Paul in the most stead; the chief captain rescued him out of the hands of cruel men, but the event he could not tell. Whoever is against us, we need not fear, if the Lord stand by us. It is the will of Christ, that his servants who are faithful, should be always cheerful. He might think he should never see Rome; but God tells him, even in that he should be gratified, since he desired to go there only for the honour of Christ, and to do good.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/acts/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But when Paul perceived - Probably by his former acquaintance with the men who composed the council. As he had been brought up in Jerusalem, and had been before acquainted with the Sanhedrin <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>, he would have an acquaintance, doubtless, with the character of most of those present, though he had been absent from them for fourteen years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-1.htm">Galatians 2:1</a>.<p>The one part ... - That the council was divided into two parts, Pharisees and Sadducees. This was commonly the case, though it was uncertain which had the majority. In regard to the opinions of these two sects, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7</a>.<p>He cried out ... - The reasons why Paul resolved to take advantage of their difference of opinion were, probably:<p>(1) That he saw that it was impossible to expect justice at their hands, and he therefore regarded it as prudent and proper to consult his own safety. He saw, from the conduct of Ananias, and from the spirit manifested <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/23-4.htm">Acts 23:4</a>, that they, like the other Jews, had prejudged the case, and were driven on by blind rage and fury.<p>(2) his object was to show his innocence to the chief captain. To ascertain that was the purpose for which he had been arraigned. Yet that, perhaps, could be most directly and satisfactorily shown by bringing out, as he knew he could do, the real spirit which actuated the whole council, as a spirit of party strife, contention, and persecution. Knowing, therefore, how sensitive they were on the subject of the resurrection, he seems to have resolved to do what he would not have done had they been disposed to hear him according to the rules of justice - to abandon the direct argument for his defense, and to enlist a large part, perhaps a majority of the council, in his favor. Whatever may be thought of the propriety of this course, it cannot be denied that it was a masterstroke of policy, and that it evinced a profound knowledge of human nature.<p>I am a Pharisee - That is, I was of that sect among the Jews. I was born a Pharisee, and I ever continued while a Jew to be of that sect. In the main he agreed with them still. He did not mean to deny that he was a Christian, but that, so far as the Pharisees differed from the Sadducees, he was with the former. He agreed with them, not with the Sadducees, in regard to the doctrine of the resurrection, and the existence of angels and spirits.<p>The son of a Pharisee - What was the name of his father is not known. But the meaning is, simply, that he was entitled to all the immunities and privileges of a Pharisee. He had, from his birth, belonged to that sect, nor had he ever departed from the great cardinal doctrine which distinguished that sect - the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>.<p>Of the hope and resurrection of the dead - That is, of the hope that the dead will be raised. This is the real point of the opposition to me.<p>I am called in question - Greek: I am judged; that is, I am persecuted, or brought to trial. Orobio charges this upon Paul as an artful manner of declining persecution, unworthy the character of an upright and honest man. Chubb, a British Deist of the seventeenth century, charges it upon Paul as an act of gross "dissimulation, as designed to conceal the true ground of all the troubles that he had brought upon himself, and as designed to deceive and impose upon the Jews." He affirms also that "Paul probably invented this pretended charge against himself to draw over a party of the unbelieving Jews unto him." See Chubb's Posthumous Works, vol. ii. p. 238. Now, in reply to this, we may observe:<p>(1) That there is not the least evidence that Paul denied that he had been, or was then, a Christian. An attempt to deny this, after all that they knew of him, would have been vain; and there is not the slightest hint that he attempted it.<p>(2) the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead was the main and leading doctrine which he had insisted on, and which had been to him the cause of much of his persecution. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-31.htm">Acts 17:31-32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-34.htm">Acts 13:34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-6.htm">Acts 26:6-7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/26-23.htm">Acts 26:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>.<p>(3) Paul defended this by an argument which he deemed invincible; and which constituted, in fact, the principal evidence of its truth - the fact that the Lord Jesus had been raised. That fact had fully confirmed the doctrine of the Pharisees that the dead would rise. As Paul had everywhere proclaimed the fact that Jesus had been raised up, and as this had been the occasion of his being opposed, it was true that he had been persecuted on account of that doctrine.<p>(4) the real ground of the opposition Which the Sadducees made to him, and of their opposition to his doctrine, was the additional zeal with which he urged this doctrine, and the additional argument which he brought for the resurrection of the dead. Perhaps the cause of the opposition of this great party among the Jews the Sadducees - to Christianity, was the strong confirmation which the resurrection of Christ gave to the doctrine which they so much hated - the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. It thus gave a triumph to their opponents among the Pharisees, and Paul, as a leading and zealous advocate of that doctrine, would excite their special hatred.<p>(5) all that Paul said, therefore, was strictly true. It was because he advocated this doctrine that he was opposed. That there were other causes of opposition to him might be true also; but still this was the main and prominent cause of the hostility.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/acts/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-9. when Paul perceived&#8212;from the discussion which plainly had by this time arisen between the parties.<p>that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out&#8212;raising his voice above both parties.<p>I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee&#8212;The true reading seems to be, "the son of Pharisees," that is, belonging to a family who from father to son had long been such.<p>of the hope and resurrection of the dead&#8212;that is, not the vague hope of immortality, but the definite expectation of the resurrection.<p>I am called in question&#8212;By this adroit stroke, Paul engages the whole Pharisaic section of the council in his favor; the doctrine of a resurrection being common to both, though they would totally differ in their application of it.

And in this the apostle showed the prudence and wisdom of the serpent, along with the innocence of the dove, hereby to divide the assembly, and free himself from them; and it was but just and right; for since they would not hear him about to make a fair and open defence of his cause, but ordered him to be smitten on the mouth, it was but justice to throw them into confusion, and save himself. <p>(w) Misna Sota, c. 3. sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/acts/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men <i>and</i> brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.</span><p>(5) We may sometimes lawfully set the wicked against themselves, so that they stop assaulting us, in order that the truth is not hindered.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/acts/23.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question....">Acts 23:6-7</a>.

He did not certainly, from his knowledge of Pharisaism and from his previous experiences, conceive to himself the possibility of an actual “internal crisis” among the Pharisees (Baumgarten); but by the enlisting of their sectarian interests, and preventing their co-operation with the Sadducees, much was gained in the present position of affairs, especially in presence of the tribune, for Paul and his work.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ συνεδρ</span>.] so that he thus did not direct this exclamation (<span class="greekheb">ἔκραξεν</span>) to any definite individuals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ Φαρισ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰμι</span>, <span class="greekheb">υἱὸς Φαρισ</span>.] <span class="ital">i.e. I</span> for my part <span class="ital">am a Pharisee, a born Pharisee</span>.

It must however be noted that the verb may mean that the Apostle cried aloud so that all might hear him amidst the rising confusion.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ φαρι</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰμι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: the words have been severely criticised, but in a very real sense they truthfully expressed the Apostle’s convictions. Before Felix St. Paul made practically the same assertion, although he did not use the word <span class="greekheb">φαρ</span>. (<span class="ital">cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-5.htm" title="Which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most strait sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.">Acts 26:5</a>), Hort, <span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 111. Moreover it is difficult to see why the Apostle should not describe himself as a Pharisee in face of the statement, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-5.htm" title="But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees which believed, saying, That it was needful to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.">Acts 15:5</a>, that many members of the sect were also members of the Christian Church. They, like St. Paul, must have acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah. But that Messiahship was attested by the avowal of the resurrection of Jesus, and the resurrection was a prominent article of the Pharisees’ creed. In the acceptance of this latter doctrine St. Paul was at one not only with the “Pharisees who believed,” but with the whole sect, and that he used the title in this limited way, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, with relation to the hope of the resurrection, is plain from the context, which fixes the limitation by the Apostle’s own words. But because the declaration shows the tact of St. Paul, because it is an instance of his acting upon the maxim <span class="ital">Divide et impera</span>, has it no higher side in relation to his character and purpose? May we not even say that to the Pharisees he became as a Pharisee in order to save some, to lead them to see the crown and fulfilment of the hope in which he and they were at one, in the Person of Jesus, the Resurrection and the Life? That the Apostle’s action met with Divine approval seems evident, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-11.htm" title="And the night following the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, Paul: for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.">Acts 23:11</a>. See “Paul” (Dr. Llewellyn Davies), B.D.1, iii., 754, 755, and amongst recent writers, Luckock, but on the other hand Gilbert, <span class="ital">Student’s Life of Paul</span>, p. 187 ff. Bethge attributes to the Apostle an apologetic aim, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, to show the chiliarch that Christianity should be protected by the State, since it was no new religion, but really proceeded from Judaism; and in support he refers to the words of Lysias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-29.htm" title="Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.">Acts 23:29</a>; but although the Apostle’s appeal may have helped Lysias to form his judgment, it seems somewhat strained to attribute to the Apostle the motive assigned by Bethge.—<span class="greekheb">υἱὸς φαρ</span>.: “a son of Pharisees,” R.V. plural, which is the best reading, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, his ancestors, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-3.htm" title="I thank God, whom I serve from my forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of you in my prayers night and day;">2 Timothy 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Php 3:5</a>, possibly including his teachers by a familiar Hebraism.—<span class="greekheb">περὶ ἐλπίδος καὶ ἀνασ</span>.: generally taken as a hendiadys (so Page), “hope of a resurrection of the dead” (see, however, Winer-Moulton, lxvi. 7).

Perhaps the Pharisees, as in the parable of the Pharisee and publican, kept themselves apart; or to a Jewish eye some mark of their dress may have been enough to bespeak a difference of party. St Paul used this party spirit in a perfectly legitimate manner. What he did was not done merely to set them by the ears, but to secure an opportunity for speaking on that central doctrine of Christianity, the resurrection of the dead. (Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm" title="Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.">Acts 24:21</a>.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Men and brethren</span>] Better “<span class="ital">Brethren</span>.” See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm" title="Men and brothers, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost by the mouth of David spoke before concerning Judas, which was guide to them that took Jesus.">Acts 1:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the son of a Pharisee</span>] The best MSS. give <span class="bld">a son of Pharisees</span>. This reading has the advantage of removing St Paul’s language beyond the questioning which has sometimes been raised about it. “I am a Pharisee,” he says. And the question has been raised, whether he had a right to describe himself thus. When he continues “a son of Pharisees” we see that he is stating that by descent and birth his family had for generations been members of that party. Having said this, he then propounds that doctrine which, of all their teaching, was that which severed them from the Sadducees. That this point also was the central doctrine of Christianity makes St Paul’s address not disingenuous, but an appeal to those who agreed with him thus far in his belief, to hear what he had further to say which might meet with their acceptance. And it is not as if the Apostle had raised the question in their midst on some side-issue. The whole teaching of the Christian church rested on the truth of the resurrection, and therefore with much wisdom and without any thought of deception he cries, “I am a Pharisee, and for teaching the doctrine of the resurrection (which they hold) I am now called in question.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/acts/23.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm" title="But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men and brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.">Acts 23:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔκραξεν</span>, <span class="ital">he cried out</span>) Making an open profession, in order that all in the crowd might hear: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm" title="Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.">Acts 24:21</a>.

Now, when more than twenty years had elapsed from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, they did not so unceasingly assail the preaching concerning Jesus Christ and His resurrection, as they did the dogma itself concerning the Resurrection of the dead, which was long ago odious to them; as indeed they had already done, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-2.htm" title="Being grieved that they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.">Acts 4:2</a> : whereas the Pharisees, in this respect, were not so far removed from the Christian faith. Therefore Paul conciliates them to himself, whilst the Sadducees were the more enraged in consequence. This then was what at that time the state of the controversy became, which Paul earnestly and stedfastly mentions subsequently, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-15.htm" title="And have hope toward God, which they themselves also allow, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.">Acts 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm" title="Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day.">Acts 24:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/26-6.htm" title="And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God, to our fathers:...">Acts 26:6-7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-20.htm" title="For this cause therefore have I called for you, to see you, and to speak with you: because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.">Acts 28:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[126] the Alexandrine MS.: in Brit.

With a ready wit, therefore, he proclaimed himself a Pharisee, and, seizing upon the great dogma of the resurrection, which Christians held in common with the Pharisees, he rallied to his side all who were Pharisees in the assembly. <span class="cmt_word">Of Pharisees</span>. The R.T. has <span class="greek">&#x3a6;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> (in the plural), which gives the sense that his ancestors were Pharisees (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm">Philippians 3:5</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Touching the hope</span>, etc. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-21.htm">Acts 24:21</a>). The words are somewhat difficult to construe. Some take "the hope and resin'. rection of the dead" for a hendiadys, equivalent to "the hope of the resurrection of the dead." Some take <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bb;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c2;</span> by itself, as meaning "the hope of a future life." Perhaps the exact form of the words is, "Touching the hope and (its ultimate object) the resurrection of the dead I am called in question." The article is omitted after the preposition (Alford). As regards St. Paul's action in taking advantage of the strong party feeling by which the Sanhedrim was divided, there is a difference of opinion. Some, as Alford, think that the presence of mind and skill with which Paul divided the hostile assembly was a direct fulfillment of our Lord's promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-9.htm">Mark 13:9-11</a>; see Homiletics, 1-11) to suggest by his Spirit to those under persecution what they ought to say. Farrar, on the contrary, strongly blames St. Paul, and says," The plan showed great knowledge of character... but was it worthy of St. Paul?... Could he worthily say, 'I am a Pharisee'? Had he any right to inflame an existing animosity?" and more to the same effect (vol. it. pp. 325-328). But it could not be wrong for St. Paul to take advantage of the agreement of Christian doctrine with some of the tenets of the Pharisees, to check the Pharisees from joining with the Sadducees in crushing that doctrine. He had never thrown off his profession as a Jew, and if a Jew, then one of the straitest sect of the Jews, in any of its main features; and if he claimed the freedom of a Roman citizen to save himself from scourging, why not the fact of being a Pharisee of Pharisees to save himself from an iniquitous sentence of the Sanhedrim? <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/acts/23.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The one part were Sadducees, etc<p>Perceiving the impossibility of getting a fair hearing, Paul, with great tact, seeks to bring the two parties of the council into collision with each other.<p>The resurrection<p>A main point of contention between the Pharisees and Sadducees, the latter of whom denied the doctrine of the resurrection, of a future state, and of any spiritual existence apart from the body. </body></html>
