Many of the nations bordering on Israel were accustomed when they made inroads to take away, not only the cattle, but the children for slaves. Another equally pathetic passage in Jeremiah touches on the very same thing. “A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children, refused to be comforted for her children, <span class= "ital">because they were not.” </span>And it would not always be said, as it was then, “they shall come again from the land of the enemy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rahel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not.">Jeremiah 31:15-17</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Thine eyes shall . . . fail</span>—i.e., shall consume. “All longing after that which comes not is called consumption of the eyes” (Rashi).<p><span class= "bld">And there shall be no might in thine hand.</span>—The Hebrew phrase here is very remarkable. It occurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm" title="It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, Take you heed that you speak not to Jacob either good or bad.">Genesis 31:29</a>. “It is <span class= "ital">in the power of mine hand </span>to <span class= "ital">do </span>you hurt.” But it means, literally, <span class= "ital">thou shalt have no hand toward God, i.e., </span>“thou shalt not be able to lift a hand to Him.” We may compare Jacob wrestling with the angel, and Moses in the fight with Amalek: “When he held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed.” Some would perhaps explain the phrase in another way; but this explanation is thoroughly in accordance with the genius of the Hebrew language, and I have good authority for it. Hezekiah said, “Mine eyes fail with looking upward.” Here the eyes fail with looking, but cannot look up.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-32.htm" title="Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, and your eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all the day long; and there shall be no might in your hand.">Deuteronomy 28:32</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given — </span>When you have provoked the divine justice to deliver you into the hands of your enemies, you shall have nothing left which you can call your own.

Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal references for the fulfillment of these judgments.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29-33. thou shalt grope at noonday&#8212;a general description of the painful uncertainty in which they would live.

This also was not true in the Babylonish captivity; for then their sons and daughters went with them, and continued with them, and returned again; but has been oftentimes verified since their captivity by the Romans; frequently their sons and daughters have been taken from them by force, to be brought up in another religion, by the edicts of kings and popes, and by the canons of councils, and particularly of the fourth council of Toledo: <p>and thine eyes shall look and fail; with longing: <p>for them all the day long; expecting every day their children would be returned to them, at least wishing and hoping they would; their hearts yearning after them, but all in vain: <p>and there shall be no might in thy hand; to recover them out of the hands of those who had the possession of them, or fetch them back from distant countries, whither they were carried. By an edict of the Portuguese, the children of the Jews were ordered to be carried to the uninhabited islands; and when, by the king's command, they were had to the ships in which they were to be transported, it is incredible, the Jewish historian says (l), what howlings and lamentations were made by the women; and there wore none pitied them and comforted them, or could help them. <p>(l) Shebet Judah, sive Hist.
