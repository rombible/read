But this view rests upon the LXX. translation of the word for <span class= "ital">“</span>store.” All the Targums, and all the Jewish commentators I have been able to consult, and the lexicons also, take a different view. The word is identical in form with that used for “kneading troughs” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm" title="And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into your house, and into your bedchamber, and on your bed, and into the house of your servants, and on your people, and into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs:">Exodus 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm" title="And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.">Exodus 12:34</a>. And so the contrast is taken to be, either (1) between firstfruits in their natural condition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm" title="That you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall bring of your land that the LORD your God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>) and the dough offered when already prepared for food, as in the wave-loaves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-17.htm" title="You shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven; they are the first fruits to the LORD.">Leviticus 23:17</a>); or (2) between the basket in which the corn is carried and the receptacle for the meal or dough, or (as Rashi takes it) between the vessel for things moist and the vessel for things dry. But the view taken by the LXX. is as old as any, and the contrast indicated by “basket” and “store” is simpler and more comprehensive than that which is drawn from a reference to the details of the law. The Authorised Version is, therefore, distinctly to be preferred, in my opinion. There are other technical reasons, which cannot be given here.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-14 This chapter is a very large exposition of two words, the blessing and the curse. They are real things and have real effects. The blessings are here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to show mercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawn to what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we be frightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing is promised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice of God. Let them keep up religion, the form and power of it, in their families and nation, then the providence of God would prosper all their outward concerns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "basket" or bag was a customary means in the East for carrying about whatever might be needed for personal uses (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-29.htm">John 13:29</a>).<p>The "store" is rather the kneading-trough <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-3.htm">Exodus 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>.

The first is directed against those who make graven or molten images of Jehovah, and set them up in secret, that is to say, against secret breaches of the second commandment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>); the second against contempt of, or want of reverence towards, parents (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>); the third against those who remove boundaries (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-14.htm">Deuteronomy 19:14</a>); the fourth against the man who leads the blind astray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-14.htm">Leviticus 19:14</a>); the fifth against those who pervert the right of orphans and widows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-17.htm">Deuteronomy 24:17</a>); the sixth against incest with a mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-1.htm">Deuteronomy 23:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-8.htm">Deuteronomy 18:8</a>); the seventh against unnatural vices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-23.htm">Leviticus 18:23</a>); the eighth and ninth against incest with a sister or a mother-in-law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-9.htm">Leviticus 18:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-17.htm">Leviticus 18:17</a>); the tenth against secret murder (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16</a>.); the eleventh against judicial murder ("he that taketh reward to slay a soul, namely, innocent blood:" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm">Exodus 23:7-8</a>); the twelfth against the man who does not set up the words of this law to do them, who does not make the laws the model and standard of his life and conduct. From this last curse, which applied to every breach of the law, it evidently follows, that the different sins and transgressions already mentioned were only selected by way of example, and for the most part were such as could easily be concealed from the judicial authorities. At the same time, "the office of the law is shown in this last utterance, the summing up of all the rest, to have been pre-eminently to proclaim condemnation. Every conscious act of transgression subjects the sinner to the curse of God, from which none but He who has become a curse for us can possibly deliver us" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-13.htm">Galatians 3:13</a>. O. v. Gerlach). - On the reason why the blessings are not given, see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4</a>. As the curses against particular transgressions of the law simply mention some peculiarly grievous sins by way of example, it would be easy to single out corresponding blessings from the general contents of the law: e.g., "Blessed be he who faithfully follows the Lord his God, or loves Him with the heart, who honours his father and his mother," etc.; and lastly, all the blessings of the law could be summed up in the words, "Blessed be he who setteth up the words of this law, to do them." </body></html>
