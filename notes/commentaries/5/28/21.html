Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>First series of judgments.

After the announcement that all these (the following) curses would come upon the disobedient nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-15.htm">Deuteronomy 28:15</a>), the curse is proclaimed in all its extent, as covering all the relations of life, in a sixfold repetition of the word "cursed" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-16.htm">Deuteronomy 28:16-19</a>, as above in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3-6</a>); and the fulfilment of this threat in plagues and diseases, drought and famine, war, devastation of the land, and captivity of the people, is so depicted, that the infliction of these punishments stands out to view in ever increasing extent and fearfulness. We are not to record this, however, as a gradual heightening of the judgments of God, in proportion to the increasing rebellion of Israel, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>., although it is obvious that the punishments threatened did not fall upon the nation all at once.</body></html>
