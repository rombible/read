Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cast ... - Some prefer "shall be spoiled" or "plundered."<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>37.

The reason why they should not anoint is, because they would have no oil to anoint with: <p>for thine olive shall cast his fruit; before it is ripe, by one means or another, as by winds, or blasting and mildew; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive shall cast his fruit.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 40.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thine olive shall cast his fruit.</span> Some would render here "shall be plundered or rooted out," taking the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5bc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> as the Niph. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>; but the majority regard it as part of the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span>, and render "shall drop off," or as in the Authorized Version.

Being thus smitten in body and soul, it would be only (&#1488;&#1498; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-15.htm">Deuteronomy 16:15</a>), i.e., utterly, oppressed and spoiled evermore. These words introduce the picture of the other calamity, viz., the plundering of the nation and the land by enemies (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-30.htm">Deuteronomy 28:30-33</a>). Wife, house, vineyard, ox, ass, and sheep would be taken away by the foe; sons and daughters would be carried away into captivity before the eyes of the people, who would see it and pine after the children, i.e., with sorrow and longing after them; "and thy hand shall not be to thee towards God," i.e., all power and help will fail thee. (On this proverbial expression, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>; and on &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/31-30.htm">Genesis 31:30</a>, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-6.htm">Deuteronomy 20:6</a>.) - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-33.htm">Deuteronomy 28:33</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-34.htm">Deuteronomy 28:34</a>, this threat is summed up in the following manner: the fruit of the field and all their productions would be devoured by a strange nation, and Israel would be only oppressed and crushed to pieces all its days, and become mad on account of what its eyes would be compelled to see.</body></html>
