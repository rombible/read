Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Second series of judgments on the body, mind, and outward circumstances of the sinners.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a><p>The "botch" (rather "boil;" see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9</a>), the "emerods" or tumors <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-6.htm">1 Samuel 5:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-9.htm">1 Samuel 5:9</a>, the "scab" and "itch" represent the various forms of the loathsome skin diseases which are common in Syria and Egypt.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. the botch of Egypt&#8212;a troublesome eruption, marked by red pimples, to which, at the rising of the Nile, the Egyptians are subject.<p>emerods&#8212;fistul&aelig; or piles.<p>scab&#8212;scurvy.<p>itch&#8212;the disease commonly known by that name; but it is far more malignant in the East than is ever witnessed in our part of the world.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord will smite thee with the botch of Egypt,....

Thevenot (i) relates, that when the time of the increase of the Nile expires, the Egyptians are attended with sharp prickings in their skin like needles. So Vansleb says (k),"the waters of the Nile cause an itch in the skin, which troubles such as drink of them when the river increases. This itch is very small, and appears first about the arms, next upon the stomach, and spreads all about the body, which causes a grievous pain; and not only the river water, but that out of the cisterns drank of, brings it, and it lasts about six weeks.''Though some take this botch to be the botch and blain which the Egyptians were plagued with for refusing to let Israel go, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-9.htm">Exodus 9:9</a>, <p>and with the emerods; or haemorrhoids, the piles, a disease of the fundament, attended sometimes with ulcers there; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-9.htm">1 Samuel 5:9</a>, <p>and with the scab and with the itch: the one moist, the other dry, and both very distressing: <p>whereof thou canst not be healed; by any art of men; which shows these to be uncommon ones, and from the immediate hand of God. <p>(i) Apud Scheuchzer.

First of all, quite generally in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-20.htm">Deuteronomy 28:20</a>. "The Lord will send the curse against thee, consternation and threatening in every undertaking of thy hand which thou carriest out (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>), till thou be destroyed, till thou perish quickly, because of the wickedness of thy doings, because thou hast forsaken Me."

"The Lord will make the pestilence fasten upon (cleave to) thee, till He hath destroyed thee out of the land...to smite thee with giddiness and fever (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-16.htm">Leviticus 26:16</a>), inflammation, burning, and sword, blasting of corn, and mildew (of the seed);" seven diseases therefore (seven as the stamp of the words of God), whilst pestilence in particular is mentioned first, as the most terrible enemy of life. &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1511;&#1514;, from &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1511; to burn, and &#1495;&#1512;&#1495;&#1512;, from &#1495;&#1512;&#1512; to glow, signify inflammatory diseases, burning fevers; the distinction between these and &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514; cannot be determined. Instead of &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, the sword as the instrument of death, used to designate slaughter and death, the Vulgate, Arabic, and Samaritan have adopted the reading &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, aestus, heat (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-40.htm">Genesis 31:40</a>), or drought, according to which there would be four evils mentioned by which human life is attacked, and three which are injurious to the corn. But as the lxx, Jon., Syr., and others read &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;, this alteration is very questionable, especially as the reading can be fully defended in this connection; and one objection to the alteration is, that drought is threatened for the first time in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-23.htm">Deuteronomy 28:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-24.htm">Deuteronomy 28:24</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1507; to singe or blacken, and &#1497;&#1512;&#1511;&#1493;&#1503;, from &#1497;&#1512;&#1511; to be yellowish, refer to two diseases which attack the corn: the former to the withering or burning of the ears, caused by the east wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>); the other to the effect produced by a warm wind in Arabia, by which the green ears are turned yellow, so that they bear no grains of corn.</body></html>
