They are real things and have real effects. The blessings are here put before the curses. God is slow to anger, but swift to show mercy. It is his delight to bless. It is better that we should be drawn to what is good by a child-like hope of God's favour, than that we be frightened to it by a slavish fear of his wrath. The blessing is promised, upon condition that they diligently hearken to the voice of God. Let them keep up religion, the form and power of it, in their families and nation, then the providence of God would prosper all their outward concerns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The oath with which God vouchsafed to confirm His promises to the patriarchs (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-14</a>) contained by implication these gifts of holiness and eminence to Israel (compare the marginal references). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The Lord has his treasures of snow and of hail, and of wind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-22.htm">Job 38:22</a>; but here his good treasure, as appears by what follows, is his treasure of rain. In the Targum of Jonathan it is said, <p>"there are four keys in the hand of the Lord of the whole world, which he does not deliver into the hands of any prince; the keys of life, and of the grave, and of food, and of rain:" <p>the heaven, to give the rain unto thy land in its season; that is, he will open the heaven, where his good treasure of rain is laid up, and bring it forth or, the land of Canaan for the enriching of it; or will open the windows thereof, and pour down the blessing; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-10.htm">Malachi 3:10</a>; and that at the proper time, both in autumn and spring, the one is called the former, and the other the latter rain; the one was in Marchesvan, or October, and the other in Nisan, or March, as the Targum of Jonathan; the former rain for the fitting the earth for seed, or for watering it when sown, and the latter for the plumping of it before harvest: <p>and to bless all the work of thine hand; in agriculture, for without the blessing of rain, all the labour of the husbandman would be to little purpose: <p>and thou shall lend unto many nations, and thou shall not borrow; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-16.htm">Deuteronomy 15:16</a>. The connection of these words with what goes before may lead to observe this sense of them, that they should furnish other countries with corn, and not need any of theirs; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-17.htm">Ezekiel 27:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> heaven to give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, and thou shalt not borrow.</span><p>(i) For nothing in the earth is profitable but when God sends his blessings from heaven.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/28.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">his good</span> <span class="bld">treasury</span> <span class="ital">the heaven</span>] As in R.V. marg.

He would so fructify their ground, and so bless their toil in cultivating it, that they should become rich, and be able to lend to other nations, and not need to borrow. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/28.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Blessing. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a>. If Israel would hearken to the voice of the Lord its God, the Lord would make it the highest of all the nations of the earth. This thought, with which the discourse on the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm">Deuteronomy 26:19</a> terminated, forms the theme, and in a certain sense the heading, of the following description of the blessing, through which the Lord, according to the more distinct declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>, would glorify His people above all the nations of the earth. The indispensable condition for obtaining this blessing, was obedience to the word of the Lord, or keeping His commandments. To impress this condition sine qua non thoroughly upon the people, Moses not only repeats it at the commencement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>), and in the middle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-9.htm">Deuteronomy 28:9</a>), but also at the close (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-13.htm">Deuteronomy 28:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>), in both a positive and a negative form. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-2.htm">Deuteronomy 28:2</a>, "the way in which Israel was to be exalted is pointed out" (Schultz); and thus the theme is more precisely indicated, and the elaboration of it is introduced. "All these blessings (those mentioned singly in what follows) will come upon thee and reach thee." The blessings are represented as actual powers, which follow the footsteps of the nation, and overtake it. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3-6</a>, the fulness of the blessing of God in all the relations of life is depicted in a sixfold repetition of the word "blessed." Israel will be blessed in the town and in the field, the two spheres in which its life moves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-3.htm">Deuteronomy 28:3</a>); blessed will be the fruit of the body, of the earth, and of the cattle, i.e., in all its productions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4</a>; for each one, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-13.htm">Deuteronomy 7:13-14</a>); blessed will be the basket (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>) in which the fruits are kept, and the kneading - trough (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-34.htm">Exodus 12:34</a>) in which the daily bread is prepared (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-5.htm">Deuteronomy 28:5</a>); blessed will the nation be in all its undertakings ("coming in and going out;" vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-17.htm">Numbers 27:17</a>).</body></html>
