See Jeremiah 14, 15 for a most pathetic intercession for Israel under this misery, answered by the order, “Pray not for this people for their good” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-11.htm" title="Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for their good.">Jeremiah 14:11</a>). Only grief is permitted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-17.htm" title="Cursed shall be your basket and your store.">Deuteronomy 28:17</a>). Relief is not given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-1.htm" title="At the end of every seven years you shall make a release.">Deuteronomy 15:1</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:15-44 If we do not keep God's commandments, we not only come short of the blessing promised, but we lay ourselves under the curse, which includes all misery, as the blessing all happiness. Observe the justice of this curse. It is not a curse causeless, or for some light cause. The extent and power of this curse. Wherever the sinner goes, the curse of God follows; wherever he is, it rests upon him. Whatever he has is under a curse. All his enjoyments are made bitter; he cannot take any true comfort in them, for the wrath of God mixes itself with them. Many judgments are here stated, which would be the fruits of the curse, and with which God would punish the people of the Jews, for their apostacy and disobedience. We may observe the fulfilling of these threatenings in their present state. To complete their misery, it is threatened that by these troubles they should be bereaved of all comfort and hope, and left to utter despair. Those who walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when every thing about them looks frightful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Blasting" denotes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-23.htm">Genesis 41:23</a>) the result of the scorching east wind; "mildew" that of an untimely blight falling on the green ear, withering it and marring its produce.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. heaven &#8230; brass &#8230; earth &#8230; iron&#8212;strong Oriental figures used to describe the effects of long-continued drought.

The allusion is probably to those clouds of dust and sand which often fill the air in Palestine, when the heat is intense and there has been no rain for a season; the wind then becomes a vehement sirocco, and the air is filled with sand and dust, and is like the glowing heat at the mouth of a furnace (Robinson, 'Bib.
