There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was a type of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power in heaven and in earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>At that time - i. e., that of the encampment at Sinai, as the words also import in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1</a>.

But it is found in the most ancient Hebrew manuscripts, and, believing that all contained in this book was given by inspiration and is entitled to profound respect, we must receive it as it stands, although acknowledging our inability to explain the insertion of these encampment details in this place. There is another difficulty in the narrative itself. The stations which the Israelites are said successively to have occupied are enumerated here in a different order from Nu 33:31. That the names of the stations in both passages are the same there can be no doubt; but, in Numbers, they are probably mentioned in reference to the first visit of the Hebrews during the long wandering southwards, before their return to Kadesh the second time; while here they have a reference to the second passage of the Israelites, when they again marched south, in order to compass the land of Edom. It is easy to conceive that Mosera (Hor) and the wells of Jaakan might lie in such a direction that a nomadic horde might, in different years, at one time take the former first in their way, and at another time the latter [Robinson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At that time, </span> about that time, i.e. when I was <span class="ital">come down from the mount</span>, as was said <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deu 10:5</a></span>; for these words manifestly look to that verse, the sixth and seventh verses being put in by way of parenthesis, as was said before.

P and D then differ thus, that while D uses the double phrase, <span class="ital">stand before and minister to Jehovah</span> of the whole tribe of Levi, P says that the Levites <span class="ital">stand before the congregation</span>, and uses the phrase <span class="ital">minister to Jehovah</span> only of the priests, and intends by it the most sacred priestly functions of sacrifice, etc., the Levites’ ministering being confined to less sacred duties in regard to the care of the fabric of the Tabernacle and the Camp and in assisting the priests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to bless in his name</span>] So <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm" title="And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:">Deuteronomy 21:5</a> again of the sons of Levi, the priests. This is another of the distinctive priestly duties (though sometimes discharged by kïngs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-18.htm" title="And as soon as David had made an end of offering burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts.">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-14.htm" title="And the king turned his face about, and blessed all the congregation of Israel: (and all the congregation of Israel stood;)">1 Kings 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-55.htm" title="And he stood, and blessed all the congregation of Israel with a loud voice, saying,">1 Kings 8:55</a>).

These distinctions are unknown to D: to him Levites and priests are identical terms. It is impossible to suppose that D silently presupposed the distinctions in P. There is not the slightest sign anywhere in his language that this was the case. On the contrary his addition, that the exercise of the priests’ office by all Levites continued to his own day and was <span class="ital">for ever</span> proves that he did not know P. And this is confirmed with its consequence, a late date for P, by the evidence of the earlier historical writings and especially by a comparison of Samuel and Kings with Chronicles. See further Chapman in <span class="ital">Int. to the Pent.</span> (in this series), pp. 154 ff., and App. vii. 5 and cp. below on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-1.htm" title="The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance....">Deuteronomy 18:1-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">8, 9</span>. The setting apart of the tribe of Levi to bear the Ark and perform other priestly functions. It is not wholly certain whether this passage belongs to the address itself or is another intrusion; yet with its opening clause (cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm" title="At that time the LORD said to me, Hew you two tables of stone like to the first, and come up to me into the mount, and make you an ark of wood.">Deuteronomy 10:1</a></span>) the deuteronomic phraseology is resumed, and the appointment of the bearers of the Ark follows naturally upon 1–5, which record the making of the Ark; see further on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a></span>. The general question arising from the difference between the data of Deut. (and the pre-deuteronomic writers) and those of P regarding the tribe of Levi and the offices here assigned to the whole tribe, will be more suitably discussed later on.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 8, 9.</span> - Moses, here resuming the form of address, refers to the separation of the tribe of Levi to the holy service. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">At that time</span>; the time when the covenant was restored at Sinai, not the time when Aaron died. The appointment of the tribe of Levi for service took place in connection with that of Aaron and his sons to the priesthood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-4.htm">Numbers 3:4</a>). The service to which the tribe of Levi was chosen appertained to the tribe as such, including the priests as well as the non-priestly Levites, though parts of it specially belonged to the one class rather than the other. Thus the <span class="cmt_word">bearing of the ark</span> was the special duty of non-priestly Levites, the Kohathites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-4.htm">Numbers 4:4</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a>); but was also, on peculiarly solemn occasions, discharged by the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-6.htm">Joshua 3:6</a>, etc.; Joshua 6:6; 8:33; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm">1 Kings 8:3, 6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">To stand before the Lord to minister</span> <span class="cmt_word">unto him</span> was the special function of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-15.htm">Ezekiel 44:15, 16</a>); but as the service of the Levites was also a sacred service, they too are said to stand to minister before the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-6.htm">2 Chronicles 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-4.htm">2 Chronicles 29:4, 5, 11, 12</a>). <span class="cmt_word">To bless in his name</span> does not mean, as some propose, to invoke the Name of God, or to praise his Name, but to pronounce a benediction or invoke a blessing on the people in his Name (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-2.htm">1 Chronicles 16:2</a>). This was the special duty of the priests (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-22.htm">Numbers 6:22-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-13.htm">1 Chronicles 23:13</a>), but might also be done by others (as by David), and in this benediction the Levites might join (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/25-27.htm">2 Chronicles 25:27</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-5</a> Moses briefly relates the success of his earnest intercession. "At that time," of his intercession, God commanded him to hew out new tables, and prepare an ark in which to keep them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>.). Here again Moses links together such things as were substantially connected, without strictly confining himself to the chronological order, which was already well known from the historical account, inasmuch as this was not required by the general object of his address. God had already given directions for the preparation of the ark of the covenant, before the apostasy of the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm">Exodus 25:10</a>.); but it was not made till after the tabernacle had been built, and the tables were only deposited in the ark when the tabernacle was consecrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-20.htm">Exodus 40:20</a>). </body></html>
