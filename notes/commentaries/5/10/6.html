The difficulty is two-fold. First, the account of Israel’s marches about the time of Aaron’s death is given in a different form here to that which we have in Numbers 20, 21, 33. Secondly, there is the further question why Aaron’s death should be recorded here. It appears to have taken place before Moses began the delivery of the discourses in Deuteronomy. It is separated by thirty-nine years from the incidents which Moses is recapitulating in this passage. The Jewish commentator Rashi gives a very curious tale to account for the allusion to Aaron’s death in this place. But though his theory is mythical, he seems to hit the main point, which is that Israel <span class= "ital">re-visited </span>in their journey round the land of Edom four places where they had previously encamped, and among them Mosera, or Moseroth, the district in which Mount Hor, where Aaron died, was situated. There is no impossibility in this; in fact, it is highly probable, and would partly account for the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a><span class= "ital">, </span>that “the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.” It was just about this time that the fiery serpents came.<p>If the connection of these verses with the train of thought in Moses’ mind is <span class= "ital">spiritual, </span>the difficulty may be solved. <span class= "ital">The death of the priest of Israel, </span>whose first representative Aaron was, is spiritually identical with the destruction of the first pair of tables, the death of the first Adam and of all mankind in the person of our representative, the Lord Jesus Christ. After that death He “ariseth” as “another priest, made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.” Thus the incident is connected with what goes before. The separation of the tribe of Levi <span class= "ital">“</span>to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>“to bear the burden of the Law,” is the same thing in another form. It deprives them of an earthly inheritance, just as He whose representatives they were gave Himself an offering and sacrifice to God; and “His life is taken from the earth.”<p>Further, the names of the places themselves have in this aspect a spiritual significance. From certain “wells of water”—the wells of the children of Jaakan (crookedness)—the people of God take their journey to the scene of the high priest’s death. From thence to Hor-hagidgad, or Gudgodah, the mount of the “troop,” or “band” (Sinai is the mount of the “congregation” in the Old Testament, Zion in the New), and thence to <span class= "ital">a land </span>of <span class= "ital">rivers of water. </span>It is only another way of relating how from the wells of the Law we pass to the rivers of living water opened by the Gospel. But we must pass <span class= "ital">by way of the cross of Christ.</span><p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS ON NOTES TO DEUTERONOMY.</span><p>EXCURSUS ON <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>.<p>THESE verses have always seemed to me to present the greatest difficulty in the whole of Deuteronomy. If it were not for their beautiful spiritual connection with the context, I should not know how to account for their presence in this place at all. And even so, the <span class= "ital">difference </span>between this allusion to Aaron’s death and the account given in Numbers, and the superficial <span class= "ital">resemblance </span>between the four stages of the journey of Israel here mentioned, and four stages which belong to a different period (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-31.htm" title="And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.">Numbers 33:31-34</a>)—together create a somewhat formidable perplexity. The Samaritan Pentateuch increases the confusion by introducing here the stages mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-34.htm" title="And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.">Numbers 33:34-37</a>—an obvious attempt to harmonise the accounts of two distinct things. The LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a> supports the Hebrew text. The fact that the <span class= "ital">burial </span>of <span class= "ital">Aaron is alluded to in this place only,</span> shows that the verses in Deuteronomy cannot have been taken from those in Numbers. The following comparison will show the difference.<p>In THE FOURTH PERIOD OF THE EXODUS.<p>IN THE FIFTH PERIOD OF THE EXODUS.<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/33-30.htm" title="And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.">Numbers 33:30-33</a>.)<p>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>.)<p>“The children of Israel journeyed from <span class= "ital">Hash-monah </span>to <span class= "ital">Moseroth; </span>from <span class= "ital">Moseroth </span>to <span class= "ital">Bene-jaakan; </span>from <span class= "ital">Bene-jaakan </span>to <span class= "ital">Hor-hagidgad; </span>from <span class= "ital">Hor-hagidgad </span>to <span class= "ital">Jotbathah.”</span><p>Three other encampments—at Ebronah,Ezion-gaber, and Kadesh—intervened before their arrival at Mount Hor, where Aaron died, in the fifth period of the Exodus, on the first day of the month.<p>N.B.-The fourth period of the Exodus has no <span class= "ital">dates </span>mentioned.<p>The fifth period begins with the death of Miriam at Kadesh in the first month of the fortieth year. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>.<p>“The children of Israel journeyed from <span class= "ital">Beeroth-bene-jaakan </span>to <span class= "ital">Mosera, </span>(where Aaron died and was buried), from <span class= "ital">Mosera </span>to <span class= "ital">Gudgodah; </span>from <span class= "ital">Gud-godah </span>to <span class= "ital">Jotbath, </span>a land of rivers of waters.”<p>Mosera is singular, M<span class= "ital">oseroth </span>plural in form. Bene-jaakan means “the children of Jaakan”—Beeroth-bene-jaakan the <span class= "ital">wells </span>of the children of Jaakan. Hor-hagidgad means the mount of Gid-gad, which differs from Gudgod only in the vowel pointing. Gudgodah may mean the neighbourhood of Gudgod or Gidgad, and Jotbathah may mean simply <span class= "ital">to </span>Jotbath.<p><span class= "ital">Gadgad </span>and <span class= "ital">Etebatha </span>are found both in Numbers and Deuteronomy in the LXX. The other names are given with some variation.<p>The places are not mentioned in the same order in the two passages, and the difference in the form of the words shows that neither passage is copied from the other. All four sites are at present unknown. The additional particulars given in Deuteronomy suggest a reason why Israel should re-visit two of the four places; namely, because of the <span class= "ital">water </span>which was to be had from the <span class= "ital">wells </span>of the children of Jaakan and in Jotbath, the “land of <span class= "ital">rivers of waters.”</span><p>The return of Israel in the last period of the Exodus to four places previously visited is in no way remarkable. We are told that they were compelled, about the time of Aaron’s death, to “journey from Mount Hor to <span class= "ital">compass </span>the land of Edom,” which the Edomites would not permit them to cross (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm" title="And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.">Numbers 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-21.htm" title="Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: why Israel turned away from him.">Numbers 20:21</a>). The return to these former encampments may have enhanced the weariness and annoyance of the people, so that “their soul was much discouraged because of the way,” and if they were travelling in a different direction, they may well have revisited these four places in a different order. They need not have <span class= "ital">encamped </span>at all of them the second time. The narrative in Deuteronomy merely says “they <span class= "ital">journeyed from,” </span>not “they <span class= "ital">encamped in.” </span>There is no reason why the district of Mount Hor may not have been called <span class= "ital">Mosera </span>or <span class= "ital">Moseroth. </span>And the name “chastisement” may have been given to it by Moses, like many other significant names in the Exodus (Meribah, Kibroth-hattaavah &c), in consequence of what took place there.<p>Further there is some reason to believe that the number of the “goings out” of Israel in the Exodus, given in Numbers 33 is made to be 42 for a special reason, like the forty-two generations of Matthew 1, in which there are at least three evidently intentional omissions. And therefore we need not be surprised at the insertion of places elsewhere, which are not included in that list. <span class= "ital">No place is mentioned twice </span>in Numbers 33. Yet the children of Israel were certainly twice at Kadesh (for <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm" title="And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.">Numbers 13:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm" title="Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.">Numbers 20:1</a>, <span class= "ital">cannot </span>refer to the same <span class= "ital">time</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>and probably twice at many other places.<p>The real difficulty is not in the <span class= "ital">facts </span>related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.">Deuteronomy 10:6-7</a>, but in the question <span class= "ital">why they should be narrated there. </span>Further, they are narrated in the third person, “<span class= "ital">the children of Israel journeyed,” </span>but all the other portions of their journey are narrated in the first person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm" title="And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and terrible wilderness, which you saw by the way of the mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadeshbarnea.">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>, <span class= "ital">we </span>went; and so <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-1.htm" title="Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spoke to me: and we compassed mount Seir many days.">Deuteronomy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm" title="And when we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-13.htm" title="Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered.

A reader of Deuteronomy who was not already familiar with the earlier books, would naturally suppose that <span class= "ital">at this period of the discourse </span>the children of Israel did journey, as the narrative says. It is only by close attention that the verses are seen to refer to a time previous to the beginning of the book, but much later than the events recapitulated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm" title="At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>.<p>In form, these verses correspond to what may be called the historical or editorial, as distinct from the hortatory portions of Deuteronomy; as the title, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1-5</a>; the parenthetical notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-10.htm" title="The Emims dwelled therein in times past, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims;">Deuteronomy 2:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/2-20.htm" title="(That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelled therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;">Deuteronomy 2:20-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm" title="Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob to the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his own name, Bashanhavothjair, to this day.">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-41.htm" title="Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the sun rise;">Deuteronomy 4:41-43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44-49</a>; with the historical portions of the last six chapters of the book.<p>Upon the whole, I am disposed to think that the only reason for the insertion of these verses is the spiritual reason which I have given in the notes.<p>From the wells of the children of Jaakan, or <span class= "ital">perversity, </span>the people of God removed to Mosera the place of <span class= "ital">chastisement, </span>where their great High Priest<span class= "note">[12]</span> died and was buried; and another priest arose in his stead.

Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader.

The appointment of Eleazar to minister in place of Aaron, is referred to as a proof of the completeness and fulness of the reconciliation effected between God and the people by Moses. Though Aaron was sentenced to die in the wilderness for his sin at Meribah, yet God provided for the perpetuation of the high priesthood, so that the people would not suffer.

But it is found in the most ancient Hebrew manuscripts, and, believing that all contained in this book was given by inspiration and is entitled to profound respect, we must receive it as it stands, although acknowledging our inability to explain the insertion of these encampment details in this place. There is another difficulty in the narrative itself. The stations which the Israelites are said successively to have occupied are enumerated here in a different order from Nu 33:31. That the names of the stations in both passages are the same there can be no doubt; but, in Numbers, they are probably mentioned in reference to the first visit of the Hebrews during the long wandering southwards, before their return to Kadesh the second time; while here they have a reference to the second passage of the Israelites, when they again marched south, in order to compass the land of Edom. It is easy to conceive that Mosera (Hor) and the wells of Jaakan might lie in such a direction that a nomadic horde might, in different years, at one time take the former first in their way, and at another time the latter [Robinson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This following history comes in manifestly by way of parenthesis, as may appear from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-10.htm" title="And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty days and forty nights; and the LORD listened to me at that time also, and the LORD would not destroy you.">Deu 10:10</a></span>, where he returns to his former discourse; and it seems to be here inserted, either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

And if a satisfactory answer be not yet given to it by interpreters, it ought not therefore to be concluded unanswerable, because many things formerly thought unanswerable have been since fully cleared, and therefore the like may be presumed concerning other doubts yet remaining. And it were much more reasonable to acknowledge here a transposition of the words through the scribe’s mistake, than upon such a pretence to reject the Divine authority of those sacred books, which hath been confirmed by such irresistible arguments. But there is no need of these general pleas, seeing particular answers are and may be given to this difficulty sufficient to satisfy modest and impartial inquirers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The places here mentioned are differing from those, <span class="bld"> Num 33</span>, it being very frequent in Scripture for diverse persons and places to be called by the same names, and yet the names are not wholly the same; for there it is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Bene-jaakan, </span> and here <span class="ital">Beeroth bene-jaakan</span>, or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Beeroth of the children of Jaakan; </span> there <span class="ital">Moseroth</span>, here <span class="ital">Mosera</span>; there <span class="ital">Horhagidgad</span>, here <span class="ital">Gudgodah</span>; there <span class="ital">Jotbathah</span>, here <span class="ital">Jotbath</span>. If the places were the same, it may justly seem strange why Moses should so industriously make a change in every one of the names. And therefore these may be other stations, which being omitted in <span class="bld"> Num 33</span>, are supplied here, it being usual in sacred Scripture to supply the defects of one place out of another. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Answ.</span> 2. Admitting these two places to be the same with those <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm" title="And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.">Numbers 33:31</a></span>, yet the journeys are diverse.

Not when or soon after they removed from Sinai; for if this place is the same with Benejaakan, as is generally supposed, they had a great many journeys, mansions, and stations before they came to it; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a> and besides, since Aaron, according to this account, died at their next station from hence, that was thirty eight years after their departure from Mount Sinai; and it is hard to say what should be the reason of making mention of these two or three journeys here; and whereas they are here said to journey front the place here mentioned <p>to Mosera; on the contrary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a> they are said to depart from Mosera, and pitch in Benejaakan; which is accounted for by their going backwards and forwards, and so both may be true. Aben Ezra is of opinion, that Beeroth Benejaakan, or the wells of the children of Jaakan, is not the same with Bene Jaakan, nor Mosera the same with Moseroth; but Beeroth is Kadesh, and Mosera is the name of the desert of Mount Hor; and it is certain that Moseroth was the twenty seventh station, and Mosera, or the desert of Mount Hor, where Aaron died, was the thirty fourth, and therefore must be distant; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>, which seems to agree with what follows: <p>there Aaron died, and there he was buried; it is certain that Aaron died on Mount Hor, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-23.htm">Numbers 20:23</a>, or there died and was buried when in the desert of Mosera: <p>and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead; so that though the high priest died, the office continued, and the law of it remained in force, and the tribe of Levi was separated for the service of the sanctuary, as afterwards expressed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the children of Jaakan to <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his stead.</span><p>(c) This mountain was also called Hor, Nu 20:28.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">children of Israel</span>] Non-deuteronomic; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-44.htm" title="And this is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Beeroth Bene-jaakan] Wells</span> of the tribe so-called; in P, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm" title="And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.">Numbers 33:31</a>, the place name is simply that of the tribe, without <span class="ital">wells</span>. ‘Aḳan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-27.htm" title="The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.">Genesis 36:27</a> = Ya‘aḳan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-42.htm" title="The sons of Ezer; Bilhan, and Zavan, and Jakan.

Interruption of the address by a piece of narrative, recording certain stations of Israel with Aaron’s death and Eleazar’s succession, in which Israel are spoken of in the 3rd pers., and the phraseology is not deuteronomic. Obviously the fragment of an old itinerary. Although the names it contains are also found in an itinerary given by P, Numbers 33, they occur here in a different order; another name is given to the death-place of Aaron than P gives, nor do we find P’s usual formula for Israel on the march <span class="ital">they journeyed from … and pitched at</span>.… The fragment is therefore from another source than P. That this was E (D’s main source) is almost certain. The fragment uses E’s formula, <span class="ital">they journeyed from thence to</span> …, and may originally have formed part of the same itinerary of E, from which there are fragments in Numbers 21; E, too, assumes the succession of Eleazar to Aaron, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-33.htm" title="And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him in mount Ephraim.">Joshua 24:33</a>, and therefore probably had already mentioned this. (So already Vatke, <span class="ital">Einl. i. d. A. T.</span> 377 f., 383; but more fully Bacon, <span class="ital">Triple Tradition of Exodus</span>, 207 f., 257 f., 343 f. So, too, Driver, Steuern., Bertholet, and Marti on this passage, and Cornill, <span class="ital">Einleitung</span>). Why the fragment should be inserted here is not clear, unless the historical retrospect originally concluded with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-5.htm" title="And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the LORD commanded me.">Deuteronomy 10:5</a>.

For other explanations see Driver’s <span class="ital">Deut.</span> 120.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7.</span> - Not only did God, of his grace and in response to the intercession of Moses, give to the people, notwithstanding their apostasy, the ark of the covenant with the new tables of the Law, but he followed this up by instituting the high priesthood; and, when Aaron died, caused it to be continued to his son Eleazar. This Moses reminds the people of by referring to a fact in their past history, viz. their arrival at Mosera, where Aaron died, and Eleazar succeeded him in his office. <span class="cmt_word">Beeroth of the children of Jaakan</span> (<span class="accented">wells of the sons of Jaakan</span>); the same place as Bene-jaakan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-31.htm">Numbers 33:31</a>), probably the Horite tribe, called 'Akan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-27.htm">Genesis 36:27</a>), for which, apparently, should be read Jakan, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-42.htm">1 Chronicles 1:42</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Mosera</span>; Moseroth, plu. of Mosera (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-30.htm">Numbers 33:30</a>). As Aaron died there, Mosera must have been in the vicinity of Mount Her. <span class="cmt_word">Gudgodah</span>, Hor-hagidgad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-32.htm">Numbers 33:32</a>); <span class="accented">cave of Gidgad</span>, a place of caves. Jotbath, <span class="cmt_word">Jotbathah</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-33.htm">Numbers 33:33</a>), a district abounding in streams, whence probably its name, <span class="accented">Jot-bathah</span>, pleasantness, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b8;&#x5d8;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span>, to be good, to please. None of these places have been identified. Robinson mentions a Wady cf. Ghadaghidh, a broad sandy valley diverging from the Wady es Jerafeh, in the desert of Et-Tih, and this has been supposed to indicate the site of Gudgodah; but the difference of the consonants in the two words is such as to render this identification more than doubtful. In the Arabic of the London Polyglott, <span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4;</span> is represented by  (<span class="accented">Judjuda</span>), which is totally different from <span class="accented">Ghadaghidh</span>. All the places, however, must have been in the 'Arabah, and in the region of Mount Her, or not far distant. That the places mentioned here are the same as those in Numbers cannot be doubted. The two passages, however, relate to different journeys; that in Numbers to the journeying of the Israelites from the wilderness of Sinai to Kadesh, that in Deuteronomy to the march in the fortieth year, when they went from Kadesh to Mount Her. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After vindicating in this way the thought expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>, by enumerating the principal rebellions of the people against their God, Moses returns in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25</a>. to the apostasy at Sinai, for the purpose of showing still further how Israel had no righteousness or ground for boasting before God, and owed its preservation, with all the saving blessings of the covenant, solely to the mercy of God and His covenant faithfulness. To this end he repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26-29</a> the essential points in his intercession for the people after their sin at Sinai, and then proceeds to explain still further, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-11</a>, how the Lord had not only renewed the tables of the covenant in consequence of this intercession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-5</a>), but had also established the gracious institution of the priesthood for the time to come by appointing Eleazar in Aaron's stead as soon as his father died, and setting apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant and attend to the holy service, and had commanded them to continue their march to Canaan, and take possession of the land promised to the fathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6-11</a>). With the words "thus I fell down," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25</a>, Moses returns to the intercession already briefly mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>, and recalls to the recollection of the people the essential features of his plea at the time. For the words "the forty days and nights that I fell down," see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-46.htm">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>. The substance of the intercession in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26-29</a> is essentially the same as that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>; but given with such freedom as any other than Moses would hardly have allowed himself (Schultz), and in such a manner as to bring it into the most obvious relation to the words of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, "Destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance," says Moses, with reference to the words of the Lord to him: "thy people have corrupted themselves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>). Israel was not Moses' nation, but the nation and inheritance of Jehovah; it was not Moses, but Jehovah, who had brought it out of Egypt. True, the people were stiffnecked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>); but let the Lord remember the fathers, the oath given to Abraham, which is expressly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>), and not turn to the stiffneckedness of the people (&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; equivalent to &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>), and to their wickedness and sin (i.e., not regard them and punish them). The honour of the Lord before the nations was concerned in this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>). The land whence Israel came out ("the land"  equals  the people of the land, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>, etc., viz., the Egyptians: the word is construed as a collective with a plural verb) must not have occasion to say, that Jehovah had not led His people into the promised land from incapacity or hatred. &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>. Just as "inability" would be opposed to the nature of the absolute God, so "hatred" would be opposed to the choice of Israel as the inheritance of Jehovah, which He had brought out of Egypt by His divine and almighty power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). </body></html>
