But this notion is confuted by many other passages. All that Moses means by saying, <span class="ital">I made an ark, </span>is, that he ordered one to be made, just as the expression, <span class="ital">Solomon built the temple, </span>only means that he provided for the building of it, and caused it to be built.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:1-11 Moses reminded the Israelites of God's great mercy to them, notwithstanding their provocations. There were four things in and by which the Lord showed himself reconciled to Israel. God gave them his law. Thus God has intrusted us with Bibles, sabbaths, and sacraments, as tokens of his presence and favour. God led them forward toward Canaan. He appointed a standing ministry among them for holy things. And now, under the gospel, when the pouring forth of the Spirit is more plentiful and powerful, the succession is kept up by the Spirit's work on men's hearts, qualifying and making some willing for that work in every age. God accepted Moses as an advocate or intercessor for them, and therefore appointed him to be their prince and leader. Moses was a type of Christ, who ever lives, pleading for us, and has all power in heaven and in earth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses are closely connected with the preceding chapter, and state very briefly the results of the intercession of Moses recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25-29</a>.

But here as elsewhere (compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a> note) Moses connects transactions closely related to each other and to his purpose without regard to the order of occurrence.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

More probably the former, an upright tree, 10 or 15 feet high, with a thick trunk and occasionally very numerous (e.g. a grove of acacias, chiefly ‘tortilis,’ ten miles long in the Arabah, <span class="ital">id.</span> 31, cp. 8, 12, 92, and found on W. el Ithm, by which Israel probably passed to the Edomite plateau); the ‘A. laeta’ is a tropical tree found only in the Ghor, and there seldom. Both Tristram (<span class="ital">Nat. Hist. of the Bible</span>, 298 f.) and Post (<span class="ital">Flora</span>, 298 f. and art. ‘Shittah’ in Hastings’ <span class="ital">D.B.</span>) identify the Shittah tree with the Seyyâl acacia, but this is never called ‘Sunṭ’ by the Beduin to-day, and indeed is distinguished by them from ‘Sunṭ’ (Hart, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span> 52). Doughty mentions an acacia, called by the modern inhabitants of the Arabian peninsula ‘ṭolh,’ the only acacia wood which is not brittle, and is used by the Solubba, or tribe of smiths and carpenters, for saddle-trees and frames and vessels for milk, and also on the Arabian coast for ship-building (<span class="ital">Arabia Deserta</span>, i. 280, ii. 91, 678).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and hewed two tables of stone like unto the first</span>] So <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm" title="And he hewed two tables of stone like to the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.">Exodus 34:4</a><span class="ital"> a</span>, JE.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and went up into the mount</span>, <span class="bld">with</span> <span class="ital">the two tables in mine hand</span>] So substantially <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-4.htm" title="And he hewed two tables of stone like to the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone.">Exodus 34:4</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, J.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After vindicating in this way the thought expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-7.htm">Deuteronomy 9:7</a>, by enumerating the principal rebellions of the people against their God, Moses returns in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25</a>. to the apostasy at Sinai, for the purpose of showing still further how Israel had no righteousness or ground for boasting before God, and owed its preservation, with all the saving blessings of the covenant, solely to the mercy of God and His covenant faithfulness. To this end he repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26-29</a> the essential points in his intercession for the people after their sin at Sinai, and then proceeds to explain still further, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-11</a>, how the Lord had not only renewed the tables of the covenant in consequence of this intercession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1-5</a>), but had also established the gracious institution of the priesthood for the time to come by appointing Eleazar in Aaron's stead as soon as his father died, and setting apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant and attend to the holy service, and had commanded them to continue their march to Canaan, and take possession of the land promised to the fathers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6-11</a>). With the words "thus I fell down," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-25.htm">Deuteronomy 9:25</a>, Moses returns to the intercession already briefly mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>, and recalls to the recollection of the people the essential features of his plea at the time. For the words "the forty days and nights that I fell down," see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-46.htm">Deuteronomy 1:46</a>. The substance of the intercession in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-26.htm">Deuteronomy 9:26-29</a> is essentially the same as that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-13</a>; but given with such freedom as any other than Moses would hardly have allowed himself (Schultz), and in such a manner as to bring it into the most obvious relation to the words of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1514;, "Destroy not Thy people and Thine inheritance," says Moses, with reference to the words of the Lord to him: "thy people have corrupted themselves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12</a>). Israel was not Moses' nation, but the nation and inheritance of Jehovah; it was not Moses, but Jehovah, who had brought it out of Egypt. True, the people were stiffnecked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a>); but let the Lord remember the fathers, the oath given to Abraham, which is expressly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-13.htm">Exodus 32:13</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-8.htm">Deuteronomy 7:8</a>), and not turn to the stiffneckedness of the people (&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; equivalent to &#1506;&#1512;&#1507; &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-13.htm">Deuteronomy 9:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-6.htm">Deuteronomy 9:6</a>), and to their wickedness and sin (i.e., not regard them and punish them). The honour of the Lord before the nations was concerned in this (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>). The land whence Israel came out ("the land"  equals  the people of the land, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-25.htm">Genesis 10:25</a>, etc., viz., the Egyptians: the word is construed as a collective with a plural verb) must not have occasion to say, that Jehovah had not led His people into the promised land from incapacity or hatred. &#1497;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; recalls <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a>. Just as "inability" would be opposed to the nature of the absolute God, so "hatred" would be opposed to the choice of Israel as the inheritance of Jehovah, which He had brought out of Egypt by His divine and almighty power (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-6.htm">Exodus 6:6</a>). </body></html>
