His name was apparently changed to Joshua at the time when he entered the promised land with the eleven others who searched it out (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm" title="Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.">Numbers 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm" title="These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.">Numbers 13:16</a>). Now that he is about to lead Israel to the conquest, we are once more reminded of his change of name, and that the “salvation of Jehovah” was to be manifested through him. Possibly the change of name was also at this time confirmed to him. Compare the case of Jacob, whose change of name to Israel was <span class= "ital">twice </span>made the subject of a Divine communication (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-28.htm" title="And he said, Your name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince have you power with God and with men, and have prevailed.">Genesis 32:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-10.htm" title="And God said to him, Your name is Jacob: your name shall not be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be your name: and he called his name Israel.">Genesis 35:10</a>). Compare also what was said to him when about to enter into Egypt: “God spake unto <span class= "ital">Israel </span>in the visions of the night, and said, <span class= "ital">Jacob, Jacob.”</span><p>We are assured by the mention of Hoshea in this place that the Joshua appointed to succeed Moses is the same person who was faithful among the spies.<p>It is also possible that this mention of Hoshea may be Joshua’s <span class= "ital">first mention of himself in the sacred writings. </span>After the close of the song, the remainder of Deuteronomy is not covered by Moses’ signature. It belongs to Joshua, or else the author is unknown.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/32.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-44.htm" title="And Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.">Deuteronomy 32:44</a></span>. <span class="ital">He and Hoshea — </span>Or Joshua. Probably Moses spoke it to as many as could hear him, while Joshua, in another assembly, at the same time delivered it to as many as his voice would reach.

It is probable from the opening words, <span class="ital">And Moses came</span>, that this is a fragment from the end of a narrative of divine instructions given to Moses regarding the Song, such as we find in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them....">Deuteronomy 31:16-22</a> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-7.htm" title="And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him.">Exodus 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do.">Exodus 24:3</a>); and indeed LXX repeats <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-22.htm" title="Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.">Deuteronomy 31:22</a> before it.

"Then will He say, Where are their gods, the rock in whom they trusted; who consumed the fat of their burnt-offerings, the wine of their libations? Let them rise up and help you, that there may be a shelter over you! See now that I, I am it, and there is no God beside Me: I kill, and make alive; I smite in pieces, and I heal; and there is no one who delivers out of My hand." &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; might be taken impersonally, as it has been by Luther and others, "men will say;" but as it is certainly Jehovah who is speaking in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>, and what Jehovah says there is simply a deduction from what is addressed to the people in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-38.htm">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>, there can hardly be any doubt that Jehovah is speaking in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-37.htm">Deuteronomy 32:37</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-38.htm">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>, as well as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-34.htm">Deuteronomy 32:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-35.htm">Deuteronomy 32:35</a>, and therefore that Moses simply distinguishes himself from Jehovah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-36.htm">Deuteronomy 32:36</a>, when explaining the reason for the judgment foretold by the Lord. The expression "their gods," relates, not to the heathen, but to the Israelites, upon whom the judgment had fallen. The worthlessness of their gods had become manifest, namely, of the strange gods or idols, which the Israelites had preferred to the living God (vid., cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-16.htm">Deuteronomy 32:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>), and to which they had brought their sacrifices and drink-offerings. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-38.htm">Deuteronomy 32:38</a>, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is the subject, - the gods, who consumed the fat of the sacrifices offered to them by their worshippers (the foolish Israelites), - and is not to be taken as the relative with &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;, as the lxx, Vulg., and Luther have rendered it, viz., "whose sacrifices they (the Israelites) ate," which neither suits the context nor the word &#1495;&#1500;&#1489; (fat), which denotes the fat portions of the sacrificial animals that were burned upon the altar, and therefore presented to God. The wine of the drink-offerings was also poured out upon the altar, and thus given up to the deity worshipped. The handing over of the sacrificial portions to the deity is described here with holy irony, as though the gods themselves consumed the fat of the slain offerings, and drank the wine poured out for them, for the purpose of expression this thought: "The gods, whom ye entertained so well, and provided so abundantly with sacrifices, let them now arise and help you, and thus make themselves clearly known to you." The address here takes the form of a direct appeal to the idolaters themselves; and in the last clause the imperative is introduced instead of the optative, to express the thought as sharply as possible, that men need the protection of God, and are warranted in expecting it from the gods they worship: "let there be a shelter over you." Sithrah for sether, a shelter or defence.</body></html>
