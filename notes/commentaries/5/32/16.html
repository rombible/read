See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm" title="Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in my jealousy.">Numbers 25:11</a>. The word expresses not only the hot displeasure and indignation of God, but also the ground of it, which was Israel’s falseness to him, whom they had accepted as their husband, and their spiritual whoredom with other gods. <span class="ital">They sacrificed unto devils —</span> Not that they actually considered their gods under the notion of <span class="ital">devils; </span>but, whatever pretext they might have for their idolatry, when they sacrificed, they really did it unto <span class="ital">devils, </span>the <span class="ital">wasters </span>and <span class="ital">destroyers </span>of mankind, as the Hebrew word <span class="greekheb">שׁדים</span>, <span class="ital">shedim, </span>here used, is thought to signify, and as the devil is called, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-11.htm" title="And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue has his name Apollyon.">Revelation 9:11</a>.

But these idols may here and elsewhere be termed <span class="ital">devils, </span>because devils brought them into the world in opposition to the true God, and gave answers by them, and in and through them received men’s worship. Many of the heathen considered their idols as a sort of lower gods, and pretended to worship the supreme God by them: but Moses here takes off this mask, and shows the Israelites that in worshipping these idols they worshipped devils, whose will they hereby obeyed, and whose work and service they promoted. <span class="ital">And not to God — </span>For God utterly rejected those sacrifices which they offered to him together with idols. <span class="ital">To gods whom they knew not </span>— Had no experience of receiving any good from them, or <span class="ital">who knew not them, </span>as the words may be rendered; that is, who had never bestowed any benefits upon them. As, on the contrary, the true God says, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-5.htm" title="I did know you in the wilderness, in the land of great drought.">Hosea 13:5</a>,) <span class="ital">I did know thee in the wilderness, </span>which the Chaldee interprets, <span class="ital">I supplied thy necessities. New gods — </span>Not simply or absolutely, for some of them had been worshipped for many generations; but in comparison of the true God who is the Ancient of days, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm" title="I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.">Daniel 7:9</a>,) and who was worshipped from the beginning of the world. Moses may, however, also intend to signify that they had not so much as the plea of ancient custom or tradition for the worship of many of their idols, and that they were so prone to idolatry, that every new object or mode of heathen superstition caught their fancy, and drew them away from their allegiance to the true God. <span class="ital">Whom your fathers feared not — </span>Worshipped not: and concerning whom they had no superstitious dread, (as the word <span class="greekheb">שׂערו</span>, <span class="ital">segnaru, </span>here used, imports,) no fear lest they should be hurt by them if they did not worship them, which fear differs essentially from that pious fear and reverence which we owe to the true God. He means they were such gods as could neither do good nor evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm" title="They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good.">Jeremiah 10:5</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/32.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>32:15-18 Here are two instances of the wickedness of Israel, each was apostacy from God. These people were called Jeshurun, an upright people, so some; a seeing people, so others: but they soon lost the reputation both of their knowledge and of their righteousness. They indulged their appetites, as if they had nothing to do but to make provision for the flesh to fulfil the lusts of it. Those who make a god of themselves, and a god of their bellies, in pride and wantonness, and cannot bear to be told of it, thereby forsake God, and show they esteem him lightly. There is but one way of a sinner's acceptance and sanctification, however different modes of irreligion, or false religion, may show that favourable regard for other ways, which is often miscalled candid.

Or "with others" (h); the word "gods" is not in the text, nor were the Jews guilty of worshipping strange gods or idols in the times of Christ, nor had they been from the time of their coming out of the Babylonish captivity; but the word, as Cocceius observes, is used for "another", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-27.htm">Job 19:27</a>; and signifies other saviours, other messiahs, whom the Jews set up when they rejected Christ, the rock of salvation; and it is observable, that before the coming of Christ, they never attempted to set up any; but, after they had rejected him, were ready to embrace everyone that offered, of which one, called Bar Cochab, the son of a star, in allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>; is a flagrant instance; and whom, when they found themselves deceived, they called Bar Cozba, the son of a lie, or a lying fellow; to whom our Lord may be thought to have respect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-43.htm">John 5:43</a>; and where he expressly calls him another. Now, not only to reject Jesus, the true Messiah, but to set up others in his room, false Christs, was highly provoking to God, who is a jealous God, and will not give his glory to another: <p>with abominations provoked they him to anger; by advancing the traditions of the elders to an equality with, and above the word of God; and by continuing sacrifices, after the great sacrifice was offered up, when they ought to have ceased; for, by continuing them, it was saying Christ was not come in the flesh, nor his sacrifice offered up; it was trampling under foot the Son of God, and treating his blood and sacrifice with contempt; which must be an abomination to God, and highly provoking of his anger, when that sacrifice was of a sweet smelling savour to him; and especially what was abominable to him, and grievously provoked him to anger and wrath, was their setting up the idol of their own righteousness, refusing to submit to the righteousness of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>; and indeed, whenever anything is set up in competition with him, or in opposition to him, be it what it will, it must be an abomination to God; because it opposes his purposes and resolutions of saving men by Christ alone, reflects on his wisdom in the scheme of salvation, flies in the face of his love, grace, and mercy, makes the death of Christ of none effect, advances pride in the creature, gives God the lie, who says there is no other Saviour, and is a total slight and neglect of his Gospel; all which must be abominable, and dreadfully provoking to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-5.htm">Isaiah 65:5</a>; <p>(h) "per alios", Cocceius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They provoked him to jealousy with <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> strange <i>gods</i>, with abominations provoked they him to anger.</span><p>(k) By changing his service for their superstitions.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">moved him to jealousy</span>] This form of the vb. is found only here, and in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a></span> <span class="ital">b</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-58.htm" title="For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy with their graven images.">Psalm 78:58</a>; another form in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm" title="They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.">Deuteronomy 32:21</a></span> <span class="ital">a</span>.
