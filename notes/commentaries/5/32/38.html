But He spared Israel, and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are. The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Repent himself for - Rather, have compassion upon.

Now these words are a taunt at the Protestant doctrine of the acceptance of the service and sacrifices of believers in Christ, through him, and for his sake, and not for any merit or worthiness in them: <p>let them rise up and help you; their God and their rock, Jehovah the Father, their covenant God, and his Son the rock of their salvation, in whom they trust; and so they will arise and help them in this time of extreme distress; though they may seem as asleep, and to take no notice of the sad estate of saints, they will arise in wrath and indignation at their enemies, and deliver them out of their hands; the Spirit of life from God shall be sent to bring to life the slain witnesses, and Christ will rise up in the exertion of his kingly power; he will take to himself his great power, and reign, and destroy them that destroyeth the earth, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/11-11.htm">Revelation 11:11</a>, <p>and be your protection; or "let him be your hiding place" (x); that is, the rock in whom they trusted, and so he is, and will be "an hiding place the wind, and a covert from the storm", <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-2.htm">Isaiah 32:2</a>; not only from the wrath and justice of God, but from the rage and fury of men; Christ will protect and defend his people against all their enemies, and in his own time will deliver them from them; who, in answer to these taunts and derisions, rises up, and thus he says, as follows. <p>(x) "absconsio", Pagninus, Montanus; "latibulum", Tigurine version; "latebra", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your protection.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">38</span>.<span class="bld"> Let them be a covert above you</span>] So LXX, etc.; Heb. <span class="ital">let it</span>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are poisonous grapes, bitter clusters have they. Dragon-poison is their wine, and dreadful venom of asps." The connection is pointed out by Calovius thus: "Moses returns to the Jews, showing why, although the rock of the Jews was very different from the gods of the Gentiles, even according to the testimony of the heathen themselves, who were their foes, they were nevertheless to be put to flight by their enemies and sold; and why Jehovah sold them, namely, because their vine was of the vine of Sodom, i.e., of the very worst kind, resembling the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, as if they were descended from them, and not from their holy patriarchs." The "for" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a> is neither co-ordinate nor subordinate to that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-31.htm">Deuteronomy 32:31</a>. To render it as subordinate would give no intelligible meaning; and the supposition that it is co-ordinate is precluded by the fact, that in that case <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-33.htm">Deuteronomy 32:33</a> would contain a description of the corruptions of the heathen. The objections to this view have been thus expressed by Schultz with perfect justice: "It is  priori inconceivable, that in so short an ode there should be so elaborate a digression on the subject of the heathen, seeing that their folly is altogether foreign to the theme of the whole." To this we may add, that throughout the Old Testament it is the moral corruption and ungodliness of the Israelites, and never the vices of the heathen, that are compared to the sins of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Israelites who were forsaken by the Lord, were designated by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>) as a people of Gomorrah, and their rulers as rulers of Sodom (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-9.htm">Isaiah 3:9</a>); the inhabitants of Jerusalem were all of them like Sodom and Gomorrah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>); and the sin of Jerusalem was greater than that of Sodom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a>.). The only sense in which the "for" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-32.htm">Deuteronomy 32:32</a> can be regarded as co-ordinate to that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-31.htm">Deuteronomy 32:31</a>, is on the supposition that the former gives the reason for the thought in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>, whilst the latter serves to support the idea in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>. The order of thought is the following: Israel would have been able to smite its foes with very little difficulty, because the gods of the heathen are not a rock like Jehovah; but Jehovah had given up His people to the heathen, because it had brought forth fruits like Sodom, i.e., had resembled Sodom in its wickedness. The vine and its fruits are figurative terms, applied to the nation and its productions. "The nation was not only a degenerate, but also a poisonous vine, producing nothing but what was deadly" (Calvin). This figure is expanded still further by <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>. Israel was a vineyard planted by Jehovah, that it might bring forth good fruits, instead of which it brought forth wild grapes (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>). "Their vine" is the Israelites themselves, their nature being compared to a vine which had degenerated as much as if it had been an offshoot of a Sodomitish vine. &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;, the construct state of &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;, floors, fields. The grapes of this vine are worse than wild grapes is snake-poison. Tannin: see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/7-9.htm">Exodus 7:9-10</a>. Pethen: the asp or adder, one of the most poisonous kinds of snake, whose bite was immediately fatal (vid., Rosenmller, bibl. Althk. iv. 2, pp. 364ff.). These figures express the thought, that "nothing could be imagined worse, or more to be abhorred, than that nation" (Calvin). Now although this comparison simply refers to the badness of Israel, the thought of the penal judgment that fell upon Sodom lies behind. "They imitate the Sodomites, they bring forth the worst fruits of all impiety, they deserve to perish like Sodom" (J. H. Michaelis).<p>The description of this judgment commences in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-34.htm">Deuteronomy 32:34</a>. Israel had deserved for its corruption to be destroyed from the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-26.htm">Deuteronomy 32:26</a>); yet for His name's sake the Lord would have compassion upon it, when it was so humiliated with its heavy punishments that its strength was coming to an end.</body></html>
