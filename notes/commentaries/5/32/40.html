As God could swear by none greater, he swore by himself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/6-8.htm">Exodus 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-30.htm">Numbers 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-5.htm">Jeremiah 22:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>), that if he did come forth to avenge himself of his enemies, he would not spare, but would do thoroughly what he had come forth to do.  <span class="accented">- Glittering sword</span>; literally, lightning of sword (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-10.htm">Ezekiel 21:10</a> [15]). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Is not this hidden with Me, sealed up in My treasuries?" The allusion in this verse has been disputed; many refer it to what goes before, others to what follows after. There is some truth in both. The verse forms the transition, closing what precedes, and introducing what follows. The assertion that the figure of preserving in the treasuries precludes the supposition that "this" refers to what follows, cannot be sustained. For although in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-12.htm">Hosea 13:12</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/14-17.htm">Job 14:17</a>, the binding and sealing of sins in a bundle are spoken of, yet it is very evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-16.htm">Psalm 139:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-16.htm">Malachi 3:16</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>, that not only the evil doings of men, but their days generally, i.e., not only their deeds, but the things which happen to them, are written in a book before God. O. v. Gerlach has explained it correctly: "All these things have been decreed long ago; their coming is infallibly certain." "This" includes not only the sins of the nation, but also the judgments of God. The apostasy of Israel, as well as the consequent punishment, is laid up with God - sealed up in His treasuries - and therefore they have not yet actually occurred: an evident proof that we have prophecy before us, and not the description of an apostasy that had already taken place, and of the punishment inflicted in consequence. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1505; in this connection signifies to lay up, preserve, conceal, although the etymology is disputed. The figure in the second hemistich is not taken from secret archives, but from treasuries or stores, in which whatever was to be preserved was to be laid up, to be taken out in due time.</body></html>
