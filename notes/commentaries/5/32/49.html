God reminds him of the sin of which he had been guilty, for which he was kept from entering Canaan. It is good for the best of men to die repenting the infirmities of which they are conscious. But those may die with comfort and ease, whenever God calls for them, notwithstanding the sins they remember against themselves, who have a believing prospect, and a well-grounded hope of eternal life beyond death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses were, no doubt, added by the author of the supplement to Deuteronomy.

As this song commenced with an appeal to heaven and earth to give glory to the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1-3</a>), so it very suitably closes with an appeal to the heathen to rejoice with His people on account of the acts of the Lord. "Rejoice, nations, over His people; for He avenges the blood of His servants, and repays vengeance to His adversaries, and so expiates His land, His people." "His people" is an accusative, and not in apposition to nations in the sense of "nations which are His people." For, apart from the fact that such a combination would be unnatural, the thought that the heathen had become the people of God is nowhere distinctly expressed in the song (not even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-21.htm">Deuteronomy 32:21</a>); nor is the way even so prepared for it as that we could expect it here, although the appeal to the nations to rejoice with His people on account of what God had done involves the Messianic idea, that all nations will come to the knowledge of the Lord (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-2.htm">Psalm 47:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/66-8.htm">Psalm 66:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/67-4.htm">Psalm 67:4</a>). - The reason for this rejoicing is the judgment through which the Lord avenges the blood of His servants and repays His foes. As the enemies of God are not the heathen as such (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-41.htm">Deuteronomy 32:41</a>), so the servants of Jehovah are not the nation of Israel as a whole, but the faithful servants whom the Lord had at all times among His people, and who were persecuted, oppressed, and put to death by the ungodly. By this the land was defiled, covered with blood-guiltiness, so that the Lord was obliged to interpose as a judge, to put an end to the ways of the wicked, and to expiate His land, His people, i.e., to wipe out the guilt which rested upon the land and people, by the punishment of the wicked, and the extermination of idolatry and ungodliness, and to sanctify and glorify the land and nation (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-27.htm">Isaiah 1:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-4.htm">Isaiah 4:4-5</a>). </body></html>
