These three verses are only a further expansion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>. Forsaking the rock of its salvation, Israel gave itself up to the service of worthless idols. The expression "excite to jealousy" is founded upon the figure of a marriage covenant, under which the relation of the Lord to Israel is represented (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>, and the com. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-15.htm">Exodus 34:15</a>). "This jealousy rests upon the sacred and spiritual marriage tie, by which God had bound the people to Himself" (Calvin).

It is also used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm">Psalm 106:37</a>. - "Not-God," a composite noun, in apposition to Shedim (devils), like the other expressions which follow: "gods whom they knew not," i.e., who had not made themselves known to them as gods by any benefit or blessing (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-28.htm">Deuteronomy 11:28</a>); "new (ones), who had come from near," i.e., had but lately risen up and been adopted by the Israelites. "Near," not in a local but in a temporal sense, in contrast to Jehovah, who had manifested and attested Himself as God from of old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>). &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;, to shudder, construed here with an accusative, to experience a holy shuddering before a person, to revere with holy awe. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-18.htm">Deuteronomy 32:18</a> Moses returns to the thought of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>, for the purpose of expressing it emphatically once more, and paving the way for a transition to the description of the acts of the Lord towards His rebellious nation.
