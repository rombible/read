But He spared Israel, and continues them still to be living witnesses of the truth of the Bible, and to silence unbelievers. They are preserved for wise and holy purposes and the prophecies give us some idea what those purposes are. The Lord will never disgrace the throne of his glory. It is great wisdom, and will help much to the return of sinners to God, seriously to consider their latter end, or the future state. It is here meant particularly of what God foretold by Moses, about this people in the latter days; but it may be applied generally. Oh that men would consider the happiness they will lose, and the misery they will certainly plunge into, if they go on in their trespasses! What will be in the end thereof? Jer 5:31. For the Lord will in due time bring down the enemies of the church, in displeasure against their wickedness. When sinners deem themselves most secure, they suddenly fall into destruction. And God's time to appear for the deliverance of his people, is when things are at the worst with them. But those who trust to any rock but God, will find it fail them when they most need it. The rejection of the Messiah by the Jewish nation, is the continuance of their ancient idolatry, apostacy, and rebellion. They shall be brought to humble themselves before the Lord, to repent of their sins, and to trust in their long-rejected Mediator for salvation. Then he will deliver them, and make their prosperity great.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/32.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Their vine - i. e., the nature and character of Israel: compare for similar expressions <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>.<p>Sodom ...

This respects the false Christians in the Roman empire, who should have taken warning by the Jews, and not have embraced such sentiments of theirs, which had been resented by the Lord, and condemned in them; such as the doctrines of man's freewill, of justification and salvation not alone by Christ, but by their own works of righteousness, saying, "our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this", <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-27.htm">Deuteronomy 32:27</a>. Now out of the errors and heresies which arose in the primitive Christian church sprung the man of sin, the son of perdition, antichrist, or the antichristian and apostate church of Rome, the degenerate plant of a strange vine; and is here described as "of the vine of Sodom", a slip from that, transplanted from Judea, and from the worse part of it, Sodom; bearing a resemblance to the old Jewish church in its more degenerate state, reviving many of its antiquated rites and ceremonies, and embracing its unsound doctrines; especially which relate to justification, and salvation by the works of men; and having such a likeness to Sodom in its abominable practices, that it is even called Sodom itself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; particularly for pride, luxury, idleness, idolatry, profaneness, contempt of serious religion, and for bodily uncleanness; even for that sin which has its name from Sodom, which has not only been frequently committed by the popes and other great personages among their, and connived at; but praised and commended in printed books, published and sheltered under public authority; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm">Revelation 11:8</a>; and with this compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-49.htm">Ezekiel 16:49</a>; "and of the fields of Gomorrah"; another city of the plain, destroyed for the same sins that Sodom was; the phrase signifies the same as before; who has not heard of the apples and fruits of Gomorrah, which are said to look very fair and beautiful without, but when touched into ashes? a fit emblem of the fair show of religion and devotion, and the many outward works of piety in the Romish church they pretend to perform, but when examined are "lies in hypocrisy", <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>, <p>their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter; which may denote the large number of the members of this church clustered together, and the many religious orders in it; which make a fair show in the flesh, but are in the gall of bitterness, and bond of iniquity; and the variety of ordinances and institutions of man's devising: so as the ordinances of the true church of Christ are compared to clusters of grapes, Sol 7:7; the ordinances of the false church are like clusters of bitter grapes, both for their quantity and quality; and may mean also their many evil works and actions, especially their oppression and cruelty in persecuting the saints, and shedding their blood; just as the wild grapes of the vine of Judah are interpreted of oppression and a cry, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>.

The reason is here given: It was because Israel had become wholly corrupt and vitiated that they were forsaken of the Lord and left to the power of their enemies. <span class="cmt_word">Their vine</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Israel itself (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-9.htm">Psalm 80:9</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-2.htm">Isaiah 5:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-21.htm">Jeremiah 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a> ). <span class="cmt_word">The vine of Sodom</span>. It has been supposed that there is reference here to a particular plant, and different plants have been suggested as deserving to be so named. But it is more probable that Sodom and Gomorrah are here advanced as types of what is depraved, and to the moral taste nauseous (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm">Jeremiah 23:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Gall</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"I should say, I will blow them away, I will blot out the remembrance of them among men; if I did not fear wrath upon the enemy, that their enemies might mistake it, that they might say, Our hand was high, and Jehovah has not done all this." The meaning is, that the people would have deserved to be utterly destroyed, and it was only for His own name's sake that God abstained from utter destruction. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; to be construed conditionally requires &#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;: if I did not fear (as actually was the case) I should resolve to destroy them, without leaving a trace behind. "I should say," used to denote the purpose of God, like "he said" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1488;&#1508;&#1488;&#1497;&#1495;&#1501;, which has been rendered in very different ways, cannot be regarded, as it is by the Rabbins, as a denom. verb from &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, a corner; and Calvin's rendering, "to scatter through corners," does not suit the context; whilst the meaning, "to cast or scare out of all corners," cannot be deduced from this derivation. The context requires the signification to annihilate, as the remembrance of them was to vanish from the earth. We get this meaning if we trace it to &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1492;, to blow, - related to &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>) and &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;&#1492;, from which comes &#1508;&#1468;&#1492;, - in the Hiphil "to blow away," not to blow asunder. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, not "to cause to rest," but to cause to cease, delere (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm">Amos 8:4</a>). "Wrath upon the enemy," i.e., "displeasure on the part of God at the arrogant boasting of the enemy, which was opposed to the glory of God" (Vitringa). &#1508;&#1468;&#1503;, lest, after &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to fear. On this reason for sparing Israel, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-28.htm">Deuteronomy 9:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>. Enemy is a generic term, hence it is followed by the plural. &#1504;&#1499;&#1512;, Piel, to find strange, sc., the destruction of Israel, i.e., to mistake the reason for it, or, as is shown by what follows, to ascribe the destruction of Israel to themselves and their own power, whereas it had been the word of God. "Our hand was high," i.e., has lifted itself up or shown itself mighty, an intentional play upon the "high hand" of the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-8.htm">Exodus 14:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-11.htm">Isaiah 26:11</a>). - The reason why Israel did not deserve to be spared is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-28.htm">Deuteronomy 32:28</a> : "For a people forsaken of counsel are they, and there is not understanding in them." "Forsaken of counsel," i.e., utterly destitute of counsel.<p>This want of understanding on the part of Israel is still further expounded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-29.htm">Deuteronomy 32:29-32</a>, where the words of God pass imperceptibly into the words of Moses, who feels impelled once more to impress the word which the Lord had spoken upon the hearts of the people.</body></html>
