We deceive ourselves, if we think that God will be mocked by a faithless people. Sin makes us hateful in the sight of the holy God.

Either without the city, the sword of the Roman army besieging it, which destroyed all that came out or attempted to go in; or in the streets of the city, the sword of the seditious, which destroyed multitudes among themselves: <p>and terror within; within the city, on account of the sword of the Romans, and the close siege they made of it; and on account of the famine and pestilence which raged in it, and the cruelty of the seditious persons among themselves; all these filled the people with horror and terror in their houses; and even in their bedchambers, as the word signifies, they were not free from terror; yea, from the temple, and inward parts, and chambers of that, which may be referred to, terror came, that being in the hands of the seditious; they sallied out from thence, and ravaged the city, and filled all places with the dread of them; and many, no doubt, through fear died, as well as by the sword and other judgments; which it is threatened <p>shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling also,  <p>with the man of gray hairs; none of any age or sex were spared, even those unarmed; not the young man, for his strength and promising usefulness; nor the virgin for her beauty and comeliness; nor the suckling for its innocence and tenderness; nor the aged man through any reverence of his gray hairs, or on account of the infirmities of old age, but all would be destroyed; and never was such a carnage made at the siege of anyone city in the world before or since; no less than 1,100,000 persons perished in it, as Josephus relates (e). <p>(e) De Bello Jud. l. 6. c. 9. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The sword <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man and the virgin, the suckling <i>also</i> with the man of gray hairs.</span><p>(o) They shall be slain both in the field and at home.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>.

This visitation is represented indeed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a>, as the consequence of apostasy that had taken place, - not, however, as a punishment already inflicted, but simply as a resolution which god had formed and would carry out, - an evident proof that we have no song here belonging to the time when God visited with severe punishments the Israelites who had fallen into idolatry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a> the determination to reject the degenerate children is announced, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20-22</a> this is still further defined and explained.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-19.htm">Deuteronomy 32:19</a><p>"And the Lord saw it, and rejected - from indignation at His sons and daughters." The object to "saw" may easily be supplied from the context: He saw the idolatry of the people, and rejected those who followed idols, and that because of indignation that His sons and daughters practised such abominations. The expression "he saw" simply serves to bring out the causal link between the apostasy and the punishment. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1504;&#1488;&#1509; has been very well rendered by Kamphausen, "He resolved upon rejection," since <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-20.htm">Deuteronomy 32:20</a>. clearly show that the rejection had only been resolved upon by God, and was not yet carried out. In what follows, Moses puts this resolution into the mouth of the Lord Himself.</body></html>
