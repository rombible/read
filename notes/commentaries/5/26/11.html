And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Syrian ready to perish was my father - The reference is shown by the context to be to Jacob, as the ancestor in whom particularly the family of Abraham began to develop into a nation (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc.). Jacob is called a Syrian (literally, Aramaean), not only because of his own long residence in Syria with Laban <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as our Lord was called a Nazarene because of his residence at Nazareth <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>, but because he there married and had his children (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>); and might be said accordingly to belong to that more than to any other land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. thou shalt rejoice&#8212;feasting with friends and the Levites, who were invited on such occasions to share in the cheerful festivities that followed oblations (De 12:7; 16:10-15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt rejoice; </span> i.e. either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

He is mentioned as the tribe-father of the nation, because the nation was directly descended from his sons, and also derived its name of Israel from him. Jacob is called in Aramaean, not only because of his long sojourn in Aramaea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>), but also because he got his wives and children there (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-13.htm">Hosea 12:13</a>); and the relatives of the patriarchs had accompanied Abraham from Chaldaea to Mesopotamia (Aram; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, consisting of few men (&#1489;&#1468;, the so-called beth essent., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc.; vid., Ewald, 299, q.).
