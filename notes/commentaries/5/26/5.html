And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Syrian ready to perish was my father - The reference is shown by the context to be to Jacob, as the ancestor in whom particularly the family of Abraham began to develop into a nation (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc.).

The ancestors of the Hebrews were nomad shepherds, either Syrians by birth as Abraham, or by long residence as Jacob.

Speak with a loud voice, lifting up the voice, as Jarchi interprets it; or "answer" (e), to the question the priest will ask, saying, what is this thou hast brought? as Aben Ezra remarks; and this being said in the tabernacle, and before the priest of the Lord, and as in the presence of the Lord, is represented as said before him, which is as follows: <p>a Syrian ready to perish was my father; meaning Jacob, who though born in Canaan, his mother was a Syrian, and his grandfather Abraham was of Chaldea, a part of Syria; and Jacob married two wives in Syria, and all his children were born there but Benjamin, and where he lived twenty years; and sometimes persons are denominated, as from the place of their birth, so from the place of their dwelling, as Christ was called a Nazarene from Nazareth, where he dwelt, though he was born at Bethlehem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>; and Jether, though an Israelite, as Aben Ezra observes, is called an Ishmaelite, perhaps because he dwelt some time among that people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>. Now Jacob might be said to be ready to perish when he fled for his life from his brother Esau, and was poor and penniless when he came to Laban; so the last mentioned writer interprets this phrase; to which may be added, that when in his service he was exposed to cold and heat, and had his wages frequently changed, and afterwards, when obliged to flee from Laban, was pursued by him with an intention to do him mischief, had not the Lord prevented him. The reason of this part of the confession was to show that it was not owing to the greatness of their ancestors from whence they sprung, whose condition was mean, but to the gift of God, and his goodness, that they enjoyed the land of Canaan. So every sensible soul, when he brings his sacrifice of praise to God for his mercies, especially spiritual ones, frankly acknowledges his lost perishing condition by nature, of which he is sensible; and that in order to magnify the riches of the grace of God in his salvation, to endear Christ as a Saviour the more, and to keep humble, and make thankful: <p>and he went down into Egypt; not directly, but some years after his former afflicted circumstances; so the Targum of Jonathan expresses it,"after these things he went down into Egypt;''after he had been in perishing circumstances in Syria, and when he was sore pressed with famine in Canaan: <p>and sojourned there with a few; with seventy souls, as Jarchi: <p>and became there a great nation, mighty and populous; insomuch that the king of Egypt was jealous of them, lest through their strength and numbers they should get away from them, when any favourable incident happened; they being when they came out from thence six hundred thousand men able to bear arms, besides women and children. <p>(e) "et respondebis", Montanus, Vatablus; "et respondens dices", Munster. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Syrian ready to perish <i>was</i> my father, and he went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation, great, mighty, <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> and populous:</span><p>(c) Meaning, Jacob, who served 20 years in Syria.<p>(d) Only by God's mercy, and not by their father's deserving.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">answer</span>] <span class="bld">testify</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-20.htm" title="Neither shall you bear false witness against your neighbor.">Deuteronomy 5:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-16.htm" title="If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against him that which is wrong;">Deuteronomy 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-18.htm" title="And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;">Deuteronomy 19:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-7.htm" title="And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it.">Deuteronomy 21:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-9.htm" title="Then shall his brother's wife come to him in the presence of the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done to that man that will not build up his brother's house.">Deuteronomy 25:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A nomad Aramean</span> <span class="ital">was my father</span>] Jacob-Israel, the son of an Aramean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm" title="And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master, and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, to the city of Nahor.">Genesis 24:10</a>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm" title="Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD: and you shall not cause the land to sin, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance.">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>), himself a nomad shepherd in Aram (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm" title="And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.">Hosea 12:12</a>, Genesis 29-31), with Aramean mothers to his children.

The translation "ready to perish" fairly represents the Hebrew; the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5d1;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span> means not merely to stray or wander, but also to lose one's self, to perish, to be in danger of perishing (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-13.htm">Job 29:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-6.htm">Proverbs 31:6</a>, etc.). Different renderings of this clause have been given. The Targum, Vulgate, Luther, etc., have, "The Aramaean (<span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>.

But these either follow another reading than that of the received text, or they are expedients to soften down the apparent ignominy of the description.

To impress this truth upon the people, Moses concludes the discourse on the law by reminding them of the crafty enmity manifested towards them by Amalek on their march out of Egypt, and with the command to root out the Amalekites (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-16</a>). This heathen nation had come against Israel on its journey, viz., at Rephidim in Horeb, and had attacked its rear: "All the enfeebled behind thee, whilst thou wast faint and weary, without fearing God." &#1494;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, lit., to tail, hence to attack or destroy the rear of an army or of a travelling people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>). For this reason, when the Lord should have given Israel rest in the land of its inheritance, it was to root out the remembrance of Amalek under heaven.
