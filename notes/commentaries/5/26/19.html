They are God's laws, therefore thou shalt do them, to that end were they given thee; do them, and dispute them not; do them, and draw not back; do them, not carelessly and hypocritically, but with thy heart and soul, thy whole heart and thy whole soul. We forswear ourselves, and break the most sacred engagement, if, when we have taken the Lord to be our God, we do not make conscience of obeying his commands. We are elected to obedience, 1Pe 1:2; chosen that we should be holy, Eph 1:4; purified a peculiar people, that we might not only do good works, but be zealous in them, Tit 2:14. Holiness is true honour, and the only way to everlasting honour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast avouched - literally, "made to say:" so also in the next verse.

It is true that only a prayer after taking the second tithe in the third year is commanded here; but that is simply because this tithe was appropriated everywhere throughout the land to festal meals for the poor and destitute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>), when prayer before the Lord would not follow per analogiam from the previous injunction concerning the presentation of first-fruits, as it would in the case of the tithes with which sacrificial meals were prepared at the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>.). &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; is the infinitive Hiphil for &#1500;&#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-39.htm">Nehemiah 10:39</a> (on this form, vid., Ges. 53, 3 Anm. 2 and 7, and Ew. 131, b. and 244, b.). "Saying before the Lord" does not denote prayer in the sanctuary (at the tabernacle), but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-7.htm">Genesis 27:7</a>, simply prayer before God the omnipresent One, who is enthroned in heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm">Deuteronomy 26:15</a>), and blesses His people from above from His holy habitation. The declaration of having fulfilled the commandments of God refers primarily to the directions concerning the tithes, and was such a rendering of an account as springs from the consciousness that a man very easily transgresses the commandments of God, and has nothing in common with the blindness of pharisaic self-righteousness "I have cleaned out the holy out of my house:" the holy is that which is sanctified to God, that which belongs to the Lord and His servants, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-22.htm">Leviticus 21:22</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512; signifies not only to remove, but to clean out, wipe out. That which was sanctified to God appeared as a debt, which was to be wiped out of a man's house (Schultz). </body></html>
