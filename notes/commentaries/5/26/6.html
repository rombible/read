And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Syrian ready to perish was my father - The reference is shown by the context to be to Jacob, as the ancestor in whom particularly the family of Abraham began to develop into a nation (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc.). Jacob is called a Syrian (literally, Aramaean), not only because of his own long residence in Syria with Laban <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as our Lord was called a Nazarene because of his residence at Nazareth <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>, but because he there married and had his children (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>); and might be said accordingly to belong to that more than to any other land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. thou shalt say &#8230; A Syrian ready to perish was my father&#8212;rather, "a wandering Syrian." The ancestors of the Hebrews were nomad shepherds, either Syrians by birth as Abraham, or by long residence as Jacob. When they were established as a nation in the possession of the promised land, they were indebted to God's unmerited goodness for their distinguished privileges, and in token of gratitude they brought this basket of first-fruits.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Egyptians evil entreated us,....

To impress this truth upon the people, Moses concludes the discourse on the law by reminding them of the crafty enmity manifested towards them by Amalek on their march out of Egypt, and with the command to root out the Amalekites (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-16</a>). This heathen nation had come against Israel on its journey, viz., at Rephidim in Horeb, and had attacked its rear: "All the enfeebled behind thee, whilst thou wast faint and weary, without fearing God." &#1494;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, lit., to tail, hence to attack or destroy the rear of an army or of a travelling people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>). For this reason, when the Lord should have given Israel rest in the land of its inheritance, it was to root out the remembrance of Amalek under heaven.
