He is mentioned as the tribe-father of the nation, because the nation was directly descended from his sons, and also derived its name of Israel from him. Jacob is called in Aramaean, not only because of his long sojourn in Aramaea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>), but also because he got his wives and children there (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-13.htm">Hosea 12:13</a>); and the relatives of the patriarchs had accompanied Abraham from Chaldaea to Mesopotamia (Aram; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-30.htm">Genesis 11:30</a>). &#1502;&#1506;&#1496; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;, consisting of few men (&#1489;&#1468;, the so-called beth essent., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-22.htm">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-3.htm">Exodus 6:3</a>, etc.; vid., Ewald, 299, q.). Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>, where Jacob himself describes his family as "few in number."
