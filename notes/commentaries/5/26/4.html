And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>On the subject of firstfruits see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-9.htm">Leviticus 23:9</a> ff. The firstfruits here in question are to be distinguished alike from those offered in acknowledgment of the blessings of harvest (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm">Exodus 22:29</a>) at the Feasts of Passover and Pentecost, and also from the offerings prescribed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a> ff. The latter consisted of preparations from the produce of the earth, such as oil, flour, wine, etc.; while those here meant are the raw produce: the former were national and public offerings, those of this chapter were private and personal. The whole of the firstfruits belonged to the officiating priest. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the earth&#8212;The Israelites in Canaan, being God's tenants-at-will, were required to give Him tribute in the form of first-fruits and tithes. No Israelite was at liberty to use any productions of his field until he had presented the required offerings. The tribute began to be exigible after the settlement in the promised land, and it was yearly repeated at one of the great feasts (Le 2:14; 23:10; 23:15; Nu 28:26; De 16:9). Every master of a family carried it on his shoulders in a little basket of osier, peeled willow, or palm leaves, and brought it to the sanctuary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand,.... To wave it, as Jarchi says, putting his hand under the hand of the owner, and so waving it; and this being waved to and fro towards the several corners of the earth, was an acknowledgment of the Lord being the proprietor of it: <p>and set it down before the altar of the Lord thy God; that it might have some appearance of a sacrifice, and be a fit emblem of the spiritual sacrifice of praise, which is accepted upon the altar Christ, which sanctifies every gift. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">before the altar</span>] In D only here.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But whilst the Israelites were to make love the guiding principle of their conduct in their dealings with a neighbour, and even with strangers and foes, this love was not to degenerate into weakness or indifference towards open ungodliness. To impress this truth upon the people, Moses concludes the discourse on the law by reminding them of the crafty enmity manifested towards them by Amalek on their march out of Egypt, and with the command to root out the Amalekites (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-9.htm">Exodus 17:9-16</a>). This heathen nation had come against Israel on its journey, viz., at Rephidim in Horeb, and had attacked its rear: "All the enfeebled behind thee, whilst thou wast faint and weary, without fearing God." &#1494;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, lit., to tail, hence to attack or destroy the rear of an army or of a travelling people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-19.htm">Joshua 10:19</a>). For this reason, when the Lord should have given Israel rest in the land of its inheritance, it was to root out the remembrance of Amalek under heaven. (On the execution of this command, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15.htm">1 Samuel 15</a>.) "Thou shalt not forget it:" an emphatic enforcement of the "remember" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-17.htm">Deuteronomy 25:17</a>. </body></html>
