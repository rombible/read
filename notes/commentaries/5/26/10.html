It is the will of God that we should be cheerful, not only in our attendance upon his holy ordinances, but in our enjoyment of the gifts of his providence.

And our creature comforts are doubly sweet, when we see them flowing from the fountain of the promise. The person who offered his first-fruits, must remember and own the mean origin of that nation, of which he was a member. A Syrian ready to perish was my father. Jacob is here called a Syrian. Their nation in its infancy sojourned in Egypt as strangers, they served there as slaves. They were a poor, despised, oppressed people in Egypt; and though become rich and great, had no reason to be proud, secure, or forgetful of God. He must thankfully acknowledge God's great goodness to Israel. The comfort we have in our own enjoyments, should lead us to be thankful for our share in public peace and plenty; and with present mercies we should bless the Lord for the former mercies we remember, and the further mercies we expect and hope for. He must offer his basket of first-fruits. Whatever good thing God gives us, it is his will that we make the most comfortable use we can of it, tracing the streams to the Fountain of all consolation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A Syrian ready to perish was my father - The reference is shown by the context to be to Jacob, as the ancestor in whom particularly the family of Abraham began to develop into a nation (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-22.htm">Isaiah 43:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-28.htm">Isaiah 43:28</a>, etc.). Jacob is called a Syrian (literally, Aramaean), not only because of his own long residence in Syria with Laban <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/29.htm">Genesis 29-31</a>, as our Lord was called a Nazarene because of his residence at Nazareth <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>, but because he there married and had his children (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>); and might be said accordingly to belong to that more than to any other land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. thou shalt say &#8230; A Syrian ready to perish was my father&#8212;rather, "a wandering Syrian."

From the partitive &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1514; we cannot infer, as Schultz supposes, that the first-fruits were not to be all delivered at the sanctuary, any more than this can be inferred from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-19.htm">Exodus 23:19</a> (see the explanation of this passage). All that is implied is, that, for the purpose described afterwards, it was not necessary to put all the offerings of first-fruits into a basket and set them down before the altar. &#1496;&#1504;&#1488; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-4.htm">Deuteronomy 26:4</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-5.htm">Deuteronomy 28:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-17.htm">Deuteronomy 28:17</a>) is a basket of wicker-work, and not, as Knobel maintains, the Deuteronomist's word for &#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1504;&#1514; rof  (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-33.htm">Exodus 16:33</a>. "The priest" is not the high priest, but the priest who had to attend to the altar-service and receive the sacrificial gifts. - The words, "I have to-day made known to the Lord thy God," refer to the practical confession which was made by the presentation of the first-fruits. The fruit was the tangible proof that they were in possession of the land, and the presentation of the first of this fruit the practical confession that they were indebted to the Lord for the land. This confession the offerer was also to embody in a prayer of thanksgiving, after the basket had been received by the priest, in which he confessed that he and his people owed their existence and welfare to the grace of God, manifested in the miraculous redemption of Israel out of the oppression of Egypt and their guidance into Canaan.</body></html>
