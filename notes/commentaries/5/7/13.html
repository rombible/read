Whatever brings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant to our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly to mortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin is never totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in us much more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In all this the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but that counsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth and negligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think, that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of the enemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they will never be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be a complete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are common effects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of the field, and more apt to increase upon us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Flocks of thy sheep - Render it instead: "the ewes of thy sheep." The phrase is unique to Deuteronomy.

This goddess, called by the Classical writers "Astarte," and identified with "Venus," represented the fruitfulness of nature. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-26. Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command thee this day&#8212;In the covenant into which God entered with Israel, He promised to bestow upon them a variety of blessings so long as they continued obedient to Him as their heavenly King. He pledged His veracity that His infinite perfections would be exerted for this purpose, as well as for delivering them from every evil to which, as a people, they would be exposed. That people accordingly were truly happy as a nation, and found every promise which the faithful God made to them amply fulfilled, so long as they adhered to that obedience which was required of them.

It may be doubted if <span class="accented">tirosh</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5b4;&#x5e8;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;</span>), properly means wine. The word is often rendered in the Authorized Version by new wine, and this is the meaning generally given in the lexicons. As, however, it is almost constantly joined with corn and oil, the immediate products of the soil - at least as unchanged by any process or manufacture - it is rather to be regarded as designating ripe grapes than wine. That, moreover, which was to be <span class="accented">gathered</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>), which might be <span class="accented">tithed</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>), which might be described as <span class="accented">fruit</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>), as <span class="accented">being in the cluster</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-8.htm">Isaiah 65:8</a>), and as capable of being <span class="accented">dried up</span> or <span class="accented">parched</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>), and <span class="accented">trodden</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-15.htm">Micah 7:15</a>), could not be a fluid like fermented nine. As the grape  juice, however, was that from which wine was elicited, <span class="accented">tirosh</span> is sometimes used tropically for wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-11.htm">Hosea 4:11</a>), Just as corn is used for bread (<a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-12.htm">Lamentations 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-14.htm">Hosea 7:14</a>). The <span class="accented">oil</span> here mentioned, and elsewhere joined with <span class="accented">dagan</span> and <span class="accented">tirosh</span>, is the pure fresh olive oil (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d9;&#x5b4;&#x5e6;&#x5b0;&#x5d4;&#x5b8;&#x5e8;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>, to shine), obtained by pressure from the berries of the olive, and used for food as well as for other purposes by the Jews (see notes on Deuteronomy 8:8). <span class="cmt_word">Flocks of thy sheep.</span> The Hebrew is very peculiar here; the same expression occurs only in this book (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-4.htm">Deuteronomy 28:4, 18, 51</a>). Literally rendered, it is <span class="accented">the Astartes</span> (Ashtaroth) <span class="accented">of thy sheep</span>. Kimchi says it means "the females of the sheep" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e0;&#x5e7;&#x5d1;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e6;&#x5d0;&#x5df;</span>), and this Gesenius adopts, rendering the phrase by "ewes." Astarte ('Ash-toreth, plu. 'Ashtaroth) was the Phoenician Venus, and it is supposed that the females of the flock were called Astartes orVenuses, as propagating the flock. There is, however, another way of explaining the word as here used, by referring it to a root '<span class="accented">ashar</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b8;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b7;&#x5e8;</span>), signifying to be multiplied, to be rich; whence the name given to the females as the multipliers of the flock, without any reference to Astarte. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They were bound to do this by virtue of their election as a holy nation, the nation of possession, which Jehovah had singled out from all other nations, and brought out of the bondage of Egypt, not because of its greatness, but from love to them, and for the sake of the oath given to the fathers. This exalted honour Israel was not to cast away by apostasy from the Lord. It was founded upon the word of the Lord in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>, which Moses brought to the recollection of the people, and expressly and emphatically developed. "Not because of your multitude before all nations (because ye were more numerous than all other nations) hath Jehovah turned to you in love (&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, to bind oneself with, to hang upon a person, out of love), for ye are the littleness of all nations" (the least numerous). Moses could say this to Israel with reference to its descent from Abraham, whom God chose as the one man out of all the world, whilst nations, states, and kingdoms had already been formed all around (Baumgarten). "But because Jehovah loved you, and kept His oath which He had sworn to the fathers, He hath brought you out," etc. Instead of saying, He hath chosen you out of love to your fathers, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-37.htm">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>, Moses brings out in this place love to the people of Israel as the divine motive, not for choosing Israel, but for leading it out and delivering it from the slave-house of Egypt, by which God had practically carried out the election of the people, that He might thereby allure the Israelites to a reciprocity of love. </body></html>
