A proper understanding of the evil of sin, and of the mystery of a crucified Saviour, will enable us to perceive the justice of God in all his punishments, temporal and eternal. We must deal decidedly with our lusts that war against our souls; let us not show them any mercy, but mortify, and crucify, and utterly destroy them.

These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel.">Exodus 19:6</a> (J prob. expanded): <span class="ital">an holy nation</span>. As elsewhere in Deut., <span class="ital">holy</span> is here used in the formal sense of separated unto, or reserved for, Jehovah, and includes an ethical meaning only by implication, i.e. in so far as traffic with the heathen and the worship of their gods, which Israel, in consequence of his <span class="ital">holiness to Jehovah</span>, was forbidden to share, would necessarily involve the people in immoral practices. See the following note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Holiness in Deut. and other O.T. Writers<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The adj. <span class="ital">holy</span> (<span class="ital">ḳadosh</span>), and the noun <span class="ital">holiness</span> (<span class="ital">ḳodesh</span>), with the various forms of the verb (prob. denominative) <span class="ital">to be holy</span>, and <span class="ital">to hallow</span> or <span class="ital">sanctify</span>, require a separate note, especially in view of certain phenomena which distinguish the use of these terms in Deut. The meaning of the root ‘ḳ-d-sh’ ‘appears to be physical: ‘cut off,’ ‘separate,’ ‘set apart.’ But in Heb. and other Semitic languages the words derived from it are always used in a religious sense, both of God or the gods and of things and men in their relation to the deity. It is not certain whether they were first applied to deity as separate from, or at a distance above men, and then transferred to men and things belonging to the deity; or whether they were originally used of these as <span class="ital">set apart</span> from common use for the use of the god and then transferred to himself. But this is clear, that as the meaning of the terms grew in Israel’s use of them, the chief influence in that growth was the revealed nature of Israel’s God. At first the meaning of holy and holiness was purely formal, without ethical content, and negative. Even in Israel, and even with prophets who had very rich conceptions of the moral and metaphysical nature of God, the terms still often retain their original and negative character. To Hosea God is Holy as the Utter Contrast of man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm" title="I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the middle of you: and I will not enter into the city.">Hosea 11:9</a> : <span class="ital">God and not man, the Holy One in the midst of thee</span>; to the Prophet of the Exile He is the Incomparable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-25.htm" title="To whom then will you liken me, or shall I be equal? said the Holy One.">Isaiah 40:25</a> : <span class="ital">to whom will ye liken me, that I should be equal to him? saith the Holy One</span>. But as these passages show, the terms could not remain negative when used of God, but became positive and equivalent to godhead. In Phoenician (as A. B. Davidson points out) the phrase ‘the holy gods’ just means the divine gods. Similarly in Israel the contents of the term Holy came to be the contents of the nature of Jehovah as these were revealed to the prophets. To Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-9.htm" title="I will not execute the fierceness of my anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy One in the middle of you: and I will not enter into the city.">Hosea 11:9</a>, see above) God’s holiness, His utter contrast with men, is His love and power of forgiving. To Isaiah it is His transcendence, majesty and awful purity, crushing and bewildering sinful man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/6-1.htm" title="In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple....">Isaiah 6:1-5</a>, <span class="ital">high and lifted up, the foundations moved … the house was filled with smoke … woe is me, I am undone … a man of unclean lips</span>), and His righteousness or justice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-16.htm" title="But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.">Isaiah 5:16</a>, <span class="ital">the Holy One is holy by righteousness</span>); it is parallel to His glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm" title="And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.">Isaiah 6:3</a>). Yet ‘none of these attributes are synonyms of holiness strictly, they are rather elements in holiness’ (Davidson).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As applied to things <span class="ital">holy</span> simply means that they have been ceremonially set apart for the deity; so of the Sabbath (<span class="ital">hallow it</span>), the firstborn (<span class="ital">sanctify them to me</span> "" <span class="ital">they are mine</span>), the sanctuary (<span class="ital">miḳdash</span>), its furniture, priests’ clothing, and foods (virtually equivalent to <span class="ital">clean</span>), etc. Similarly men are holy not because of their character, but from their devotion to the deity or His service, e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/21-5.htm" title="And David answered the priest, and said to him, Of a truth women have been kept from us about these three days, since I came out, and the vessels of the young men are holy, and the bread is in a manner common, yes, though it were sanctified this day in the vessel.">1 Samuel 21:5</a> f. of soldiers (of divers characters) consecrated to war (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-1.htm" title="When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, be not afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 20:1</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-3.htm" title="Yes, he loved the people; all his saints are in your hand: and they sat down at your feet; every one shall receive of your words.">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>); of a prophet, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-9.htm" title="And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.">2 Kings 4:9</a>; and frequently in P of priests, Levites and Nazirites. In E, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-31.htm" title="And you shall be holy men to me: neither shall you eat any flesh that is torn of beasts in the field; you shall cast it to the dogs.">Exodus 22:31</a>, <span class="ital">holy</span> is applied to the whole nation: they must not eat flesh torn by beasts of the field and not slain ritually, because they are <span class="ital">men holy to Jehovah</span>, His own and set apart for Him; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm" title="Israel was holiness to the LORD, and the first fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 2:3</a> holy = inviolable: as <span class="ital">holiness</span> to Jehovah, early Israel could not be devoured by other nations without guilt falling on these. Here also, however, the character of the God to whom Israel was sacred, gradually ethicised the term <span class="ital">holy</span>. This appears as early as J. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> f. (unless this passage is editorial), where it is announced that the people will be <span class="ital">holy</span> if they obey God’s voice and keep His covenant; and it is very clear in the formula, <span class="ital">Be ye holy for I am holy</span>, because of its connection with moral requirements, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/19-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 19:1-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-7.htm" title="Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be you holy: for I am the LORD your God.">Leviticus 20:7</a>. Even when Israel’s holiness is emphasised as incompatible with attendance on heathen cults, the notoriously immoral character of these implies that the holiness is not merely ceremonial but ethical as well. In Psalms 15, 24 only the upright and pure are fit to dwell in the holy place of God; yet even here holiness may mean no more than an awful sacredness (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-14.htm" title="The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness has surprised the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?">Isaiah 33:14</a> f.). On the whole subject see A. B. Davidson, <span class="ital">Theol. of the O.T.</span> 144 ff., and J. Skinner, art. ‘Holiness in the O.T.’ in Hastings’ <span class="ital">D.B.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span></span>In Deut., in which the use of <span class="ital">holy</span> and <span class="ital">holiness</span> is not so frequent or characteristic as it is in the Prophets and P, we find only some of the meanings described above; the whole range of them is not covered. The purely ritual sense, applied to things and men consecrated to God, is oftenest expressed: <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.">Deuteronomy 5:12</a> (the Sabbath); <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm" title="All the firstling males that come of your herd and of your flock you shall sanctify to the LORD your God: you shall do no work with the firstling of your bullock, nor shear the firstling of your sheep.">Deuteronomy 15:19</a> (firstling males); <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-26.htm" title="Only your holy things which you have, and your vows, you shall take, and go to the place which the LORD shall choose:">Deuteronomy 12:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-13.htm" title="Then you shall say before the LORD your God, I have brought away the hallowed things out of my house, and also have given them to the Levite, and to the stranger, to the fatherless, and to the widow, according to all your commandments which you have commanded me: I have not transgressed your commandments, neither have I forgotten them.">Deuteronomy 26:13</a> (<span class="ital">all thy holy things</span>, vows and tithes of the increase of fields and flocks); <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-14.htm" title="For the LORD your God walks in the middle of your camp, to deliver you, and to give up your enemies before you; therefore shall your camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing in you, and turn away from you.">Deuteronomy 23:14</a> (the camp, because of God’s presence); cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm" title="You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled.">Deuteronomy 22:9</a> where R.V. <span class="ital">forfeited</span>, probably the exact meaning, is literally <span class="ital">hallowed</span> or <span class="ital">consecrated</span>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-17.htm" title="There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.">Deuteronomy 23:17</a> f. where the men and women who sacrificed their chastity to the gods are called by the names they bore throughout the Semitic world (<span class="ital">Ḳadesh</span> and <span class="ital">Ḳedeshah</span>). Five times is Israel called <span class="ital">a holy people</span>—<span class="ital">a people holy to Jehovah thy God</span>. But in one of these passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-19.htm" title="And to make you high above all nations which he has made, in praise, and in name, and in honor; and that you may be an holy people to the LORD your God, as he has spoken.">Deuteronomy 26:19</a>, this means a people <span class="ital">distinct</span> from other nations, and high above them in renown; and in another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-9.htm" title="The LORD shall establish you an holy people to himself, as he has sworn to you, if you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and walk in his ways.">Deuteronomy 28:9</a> (as the context shows), an <span class="ital">inviolable</span> people just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-3.htm" title="Israel was holiness to the LORD, and the first fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come on them, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 2:3</a>, though the condition of such inviolableness is moral, their obedience to all the commandments of Jehovah. In two others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm" title="You shall not eat of anything that dies of itself: you shall give it to the stranger that is in your gates, that he may eat it; or you may sell it to an alien: for you are an holy people to the LORD your God. You shall not seethe a kid in his mother's milk.">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, the phrase is used as the ground for their abstention from mutilation for the dead, and from eating what has not been ritually slain; while in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God: the LORD your God has chosen you to be a special people to himself, above all people that are on the face of the earth.">Deuteronomy 7:6</a> it is given (as we have seen) as a reason for not treating or trafficking with the heathen or engaging in their cults. In these last three cases a moral meaning is doubtless implied in <span class="ital">holy</span>, because of the notoriously immoral character of such cults, but it is not explicit. This is strange after what we have seen of the moral contents of the term <span class="ital">holy</span> in the Prophets. But stranger still as coming after the Prophets (see above) is the fact that <span class="ital">holy</span> is nowhere in Deut. applied to God Himself (though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-15.htm" title="Look down from your holy habitation, from heaven, and bless your people Israel, and the land which you have given us, as you swore to our fathers, a land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 26:15</a> heaven is called <span class="ital">His holy habitation</span>); and He is not Styled as Isaiah so frequently styles Him <span class="ital">the Holy One of Israel</span>. Did the deuteronomists purposely avoid the association of this name with Jehovah because of some superstitious use of it (cp. Jeremiah’s repudiation of Isaiah’s conviction of the sanctity of the Temple, when this had become a mere fetish with the people), or because it was also applied to heathen gods?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Jehovah</span> <span class="ital">thy God hath chosen thee</span>] The order of the original is much more emphatic: <span class="ital">And</span> (so Sam., LXX and some Heb. MSS) <span class="ital">thee hath Jehovah thy God chosen</span>. Similarly <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-37.htm" title="And because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out in his sight with his mighty power out of Egypt;">Deuteronomy 4:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-15.htm" title="Only the LORD had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as it is this day.">Deuteronomy 10:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a> with Sg., and with Pl. only <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-7.htm" title="The LORD did not set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all people:">Deuteronomy 7:7</a>. The idea and its expression are characteristic of D; it is not found in other documents of the Hex. nor in pre-deuteronomic writings (yet cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-2.htm" title="You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.">Amos 3:2</a>), but occurs frequently after D, in the deuteronomic <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm" title="Consider you not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD has chosen, he has even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them.">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-8.htm" title="And your servant is in the middle of your people which you have chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered nor counted for multitude.">1 Kings 3:8</a>; and frequently in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend....">Isaiah 41:8-9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-10.htm" title="You are my witnesses, said the LORD, and my servant whom I have chosen: that you may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.">Isaiah 43:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-1.htm" title="Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen:...">Isaiah 44:1-2</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-20.htm" title="The beast of the field shall honor me, the dragons and the owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.">Isaiah 43:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-4.htm" title="For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel my elect, I have even called you by your name: I have surnamed you, though you have not known me.">Isaiah 45:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-7.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One, to him whom man despises, to him whom the nation abhors, to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose you.">Isaiah 49:7</a>; also of God’s restoration of the exiled Israel <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm" title="For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall join to the house of Jacob.">Isaiah 14:1</a>. We must not impart into the phrase the full meaning of ‘election’ in the N.T. or Christian theology. As the passages in 2nd Isaiah show, ‘election’ by God is election to service (see the writer’s <span class="ital">Isaiah</span> xl.–lxvi. pp. 237 f.), and as Jeremiah 18 shows, it may be annulled if the object of it prove to be unworthy; yet, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-1.htm" title="For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers shall be joined with them, and they shall join to the house of Jacob.">Isaiah 14:1</a>, it may, on repentance being shown, be renewed; cp. below <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm" title="That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.">Deuteronomy 30:3</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a peculiar people</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">a people of special possession</span>; in late O.T. of the privy property of kings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-3.htm" title="Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.">1 Chronicles 29:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm" title="I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces: I got me men singers and women singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical instruments, and that of all sorts.">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>; in N.

Not certainly found before D, for <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> is editorial.

The reasons for the previous commands to destroy the peoples of the land, and to abstain from traffic with them, leading as this would to participation in their worship of other gods. Israel are for Jehovah alone: to this end He loved, chose, and redeemed them. This is one of the many cases in Deut. in which the principles or ideas offered for certain practices or acts of conduct commanded to Israel are of a far higher standard than these practices themselves, and therefore have endured as the essentials of religion when the practices are either no longer prescribed or actually forbidden (as in Christianity). The passage, which might appear to be founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> f., is not certainly so; for <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm" title="Now therefore, if you will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine:">Exodus 19:5</a> f.

This righteousness before Jehovah, it is true, is not really the gospel "righteousness of faith;" but there is no opposition between the two, as the righteousness mentioned here is not founded upon the outward (pharisaic) righteousness of works, but upon an earnest striving after the fulfilment of the law, to love God with all the heart; and this love is altogether impossible without living faith. </body></html>
