It must not be forgotten that the law of Moses was in many of its details a sanitary quite as much as a moral code. Some of the associations of this word and the root from which it is derived would seem to point to those “languors” and “infirmities” which arise from neglect and violation of the laws of God, both moral and physical.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-15.htm" title="And the LORD will take away from you all sickness, and will put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, on you; but will lay them on all them that hate you.">Deuteronomy 7:15</a></span>. <span class="ital">The diseases of Egypt — </span>Such as the Egyptians were infected with, either commonly, or miraculously. It seems to refer not only to the plagues of Egypt, but to some other epidemic diseases, which they remembered to have prevailed among the Egyptians, and by which God had chastised them for their national sins. The leprosy, and other cutaneous distempers, were frequent in Egypt. The Scriptures also mention the botch of Egypt, as a disease common in that country, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm" title="The LORD will smite you with the botch of Egypt, and with the tumors, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof you can not be healed.">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>.

Whatever brings us into a snare, brings us under a curse. Let us be constant to our duty, and we cannot question the constancy of God's mercy. Diseases are God's servants; they go where he sends them, and do what he bids them. It is therefore good for the health of our bodies, thoroughly to mortify the sin of our souls; which is our rule of duty. Yet sin is never totally destroyed in this world; and it actually prevails in us much more than it would do, if we were watchful and diligent. In all this the Lord acts according to the counsel of his own will; but that counsel being hid from us, forms no excuse for our sloth and negligence, of which it is in no degree the cause. We must not think, that because the deliverance of the church, and the destruction of the enemies of the soul, are not done immediately, therefore they will never be done. God will do his own work in his own method and time; and we may be sure that they are always the best. Thus corruption is driven out of the hearts of believers by little and little. The work of sanctification is carried on gradually; but at length there will be a complete victory. Pride, security, and other sins that are common effects of prosperity, are enemies more dangerous than beasts of the field, and more apt to increase upon us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There seems to be here not so much as a reference to the plagues inflicted miraculously by God on Egypt (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm">Exodus 15:26</a>), as to the terrible diseases with which, above other countries, Egypt was infested.

Besides those with which Pharaoh and his subjects were visited, Egypt has always been dreadfully scourged with diseases.

This development of the nature of God Moses introduces from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5-6</a>, as a light warning not to forfeit the mercy of God, or draw upon themselves His holy wrath by falling into idolatry. To this end He emphatically carries out still further the thought of retribution, by adding &#1500;&#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, "to destroy him" (the hater), and &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1488;&#1492;&#1512; &#1500;&#1488;, "He delays not to His hater (sc., to repay him); He will repay him to his face." "To the face of every one of them," i.e., that they may see and feel that they are smitten by God (Rosenmller). </body></html>
