So David to Goliath: “Thou comest to me with a sword and with a spear, and with a shield; but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of Hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-45.htm" title="Then said David to the Philistine, You come to me with a sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.">1Samuel 17:45</a>). And so the Psalmist: “Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the Lord our God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm" title="Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.">Psalm 20:7</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:1-9 In the wars wherein Israel engaged according to the will of God, they might expect the Divine assistance. The Lord was to be their only confidence. In these respects they were types of the Christian's warfare. Those unwilling to fight, must be sent away. The unwillingness might arise from a man's outward condition. God would not be served by men forced against their will. Thy people shall be willing, Ps 110:3. In running the Christian race, and fighting the good fight of faith, we must lay aside all that would make us unwilling. If a man's unwillingness rose from weakness and fear, he had leave to return from the war. The reason here given is, lest his brethren's heart fail as well as his heart. We must take heed that we fear not with the fear of them that are afraid, Isa 8:12.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The priest - Not the high priest, but one appointed for the purpose, and called, according to the rabbis, "the anointed of the war": hence, perhaps the expression of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-4.htm">Jeremiah 6:4</a>, etc. "prepare ye" (literally consecrate) "war."

These judges were to investigate the case most thoroughly (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm">Deuteronomy 13:15</a>); and if the witness had spoken lies, they were to do to him as he thought to do to his brother.
