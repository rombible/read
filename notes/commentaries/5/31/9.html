The deliverance here must be understood as a charge and a trust conveyed to the priests, making them responsible for the “reading of the law,” and for the instruction of the people. This is the special duty of the priests. They are said to “bear” the ark of the covenant here; not because they always carried it (they did sometimes, as in Joshua 3), but because they were responsible for it, just as they were also responsible for the exposition of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm" title="And you shall come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire; and they shall show you the sentence of judgment:">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>).

This solemn reading of the law must be done in the year of release. The year of release was typical of gospel grace, which is called the acceptable year of the Lord; for our pardon and liberty by Christ, engage us to keep his commandments. It must be read to all Israel, men, women, children, and to the strangers. It is the will of God that all people should acquaint themselves with his word. It is a rule to all, therefore should be read to all. Whoever has read of the pains taken by many persons to get scraps of the Scriptures, when a whole copy could not be obtained, or safely possessed, will see how thankful we should be for the thousands of copies amongst us. They will also understand the very different situation in which the Israelites were placed for many ages. But the heart of man is so careless, that all will be found too little, to keep up a knowledge of the truths, precepts, and worship of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses hands over to Joshua that office as leader of the people, to which he had already been designated <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-23.htm">Numbers 27:23</a>.

And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests&#8212;The law thus committed to writing was either the whole book of Deuteronomy, or the important part of it contained between the twenty-seventh and thirtieth chapters. It was usual in cases of public or private contract for two copies of the engagement to be made&#8212;one to be deposited in the national archives or some secure place for reference, should occasion require. The other was to remain in the hands of the contracting parties (Jer 32:12-14). The same course was followed on this renewal of the covenant between God and Israel. Two written copies of the law were prepared, the one of which was delivered to the public representatives of Israel; namely, the priests and the elders.<p>the priests, &#8230; who bare the ark of the covenant&#8212;In all ordinary journeys, it was the common duty of the Levites to carry the ark and its furniture (Nu 4:15); but, on solemn or extraordinary occasions, that office was discharged by the priests (Jos 3:3-8; 6:6; 1Ch 15:11, 12).<p>all the elders of Israel&#8212;They were assistants to the priests and overseers to take care of the preservation, rehearsal, and observance of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This law, </span> largely so called, the whole law or doctrine delivered unto Moses contained in these five books. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Delivered it unto the priests, </span> that they might keep it carefully and religiously, and bring it forth upon occasion, and read it, and instruct the people out of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which bare the ark, </span> to wit, sometimes in great solemnities, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/3-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand on an heap.">Joshua 3:13</a>,17 6:12 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-3.htm" title="And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark.">1 Kings 8:3</a></span>; though the Levites also might bear it, as appears from <span class="bld"> Num 3 Num 4 Num 10 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm" title="Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the Levites: for them has the LORD chosen to carry the ark of God, and to minister to him for ever.">1 Chronicles 15:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The elders of Israel</span> were assistants to the priests, and overseers to take care that the law should be kept, and read, and observed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Moses wrote this law,....

Moses "entrusted the reading to the priesthood and the college of elders, as the spiritual and secular rulers of the congregation; and hence the singular, Thou shalt read this Law to all Israel" (Keil).

As the reading was to be only once in seven years, it may be concluded that it was not so much for the information of the people that this was done, as for the purpose of publicly declaring, and by a solemn ceremony impressing on their minds the condition on which they held their position and privileges as the chosen people of the Lord; and for this the reading of select portions of the Torah would be sufficient. The Feast of Tabernacles was appointed as the season for the reading, <span class="accented">doubtless</span> because <span class="accented">there</span> was a <span class="accented">connection</span> between the end for which the Law was read and the spirit and meaning of that festival as a festival of rejoicing because of their deliverance from the uncertainty and unsettledness of their state in the wilderness, and their establishment in a well-ordered state where they could in peace and quietness enjoy the blessings which the bounty of God bestowed. <span class="cmt_word">When all Israel is come to appear before the Lord</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-16.htm">Deuteronomy 16:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Thou shalt read this law</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-34.htm">Joshua 8:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, etc.). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But although Moses could not, and was not to lead his people into Canaan, the Lord would fulfil His promise, to go before Israel and destroy the Canaanites, like the two kings of the Amorites; only they (the Israelites) were to do to them as the Lord had commanded them, i.e., to root out the Canaanites (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm">Deuteronomy 7:2</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-51.htm">Numbers 33:51</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-11.htm">Exodus 34:11</a>.).</body></html>
