This is applied by the apostle to all God's spiritual Israel, to encourage their faith and hope; unto us is this gospel preached, as well as unto them; he will never fail thee, nor forsake thee, Heb 13:5. Moses commends Joshua to them for a leader; one whose wisdom, and courage, and affection they had long known; one whom God had appointed to be their leader; and therefore would own and bless. Joshua is well pleased to be admonished by Moses to be strong and of good courage. Those shall speed well, who have God with them; therefore they ought to be of good courage. Through God let us do valiantly, for through him we shall do victoriously; if we resist the devil, he will flee from us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am an hundred and twenty years old - The 40 years of the wandering had passed since Moses, then 80 years old, "spake unto Pharaoh" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/7-7.htm">Exodus 7:7</a>; Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-7.htm">Deuteronomy 34:7</a>).<p>I can, no more go out and come in - Render I shall not longer be able to go out and come in: i. e., discharge my duties among you.

While taking a solemn leave of the people, Moses exhorted them not to be intimidated by the menacing opposition of enemies; to take encouragement from the continued presence of their covenanted God; and to rest assured that the same divine power, which had enabled them to discomfit their first assailants on the east of Jordan, would aid them not less effectually in the adventurous enterprise which they were about to undertake, and by which they would obtain possession of "the land which He had sworn unto their fathers to give them."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee,....

He had set before them this day life and good ("good"  equals  prosperity and salvation), as well as death and evil (&#1512;&#1506;, adversity and destruction), by commanding them to love the Lord and walk in His ways. Love is placed first, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, as being the essential principle of the fulfilment of the commandments. Expounding the law was setting before them life and death, salvation and destruction, because the law, as the word of God, was living and powerful, and proved itself in every man a power of life or of death, according to the attitude which he assumed towards it (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>). &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, to permit oneself to be torn away to idolatry (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>). </body></html>
