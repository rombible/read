This solemn reading of the law must be done in the year of release. The year of release was typical of gospel grace, which is called the acceptable year of the Lord; for our pardon and liberty by Christ, engage us to keep his commandments. It must be read to all Israel, men, women, children, and to the strangers. It is the will of God that all people should acquaint themselves with his word. It is a rule to all, therefore should be read to all. Whoever has read of the pains taken by many persons to get scraps of the Scriptures, when a whole copy could not be obtained, or safely possessed, will see how thankful we should be for the thousands of copies amongst us. They will also understand the very different situation in which the Israelites were placed for many ages. But the heart of man is so careless, that all will be found too little, to keep up a knowledge of the truths, precepts, and worship of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. It is not to be supposed that the whole of the Pentateuch was read, nor does the letter of the command require that it should be so. This reading could not be primarily designed for the information and instruction of the people, since it only took place once in seven years; but was evidently a symbolic transaction, intended, as were so many others, to impress on the people the conditions on which they held possession of their privileges and blessings. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10, 11. At the end of every seven years, &#8230; thou shalt read this law&#8212;At the return of the sabbatic year and during the feast of tabernacles, the law was to be publicly read. This order of Moses was a future and prospective arrangement; for the observance of the sabbatic year did not commence till the conquest and peaceful occupation of Canaan. The ordinance served several important purposes. For, while the people had opportunities of being instructed in the law every Sabbath and daily in their own homes, this public periodical rehearsal at meetings in the courts of the sanctuary, where women and children of twelve years were present (as they usually were at the great festivals), was calculated to produce good and pious impressions of divine truth amid the sacred associations of the time and place. Besides, it formed a public guarantee for the preservation, integrity, and faithful transmission of the Sacred Book to successive ages.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Thyself in part, for the Jews tell us that the king was in person to read some part of it; or, at least, thou shalt cause it to be read by the priests or Levites, for he could not read it himself in the hearing of all Israel, but this was to be done by several persons, and to the people met in several congregations.

Josephus (x) ascribes this service to the high priest; he says, standing in an high pulpit (or on an high bench),"from whence he may be heard, he must read the laws to all;''but the Jewish writers commonly allot this work to the king, or supreme governor, who at least was to read some parts of it; so Jarchi says, the king at first read Deuteronomy, as it is said in the Misnah (y);"he read from the beginning of Deuteronomy to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>; hear, O Israel, &amp;c. and then added <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm">Deuteronomy 11:13</a>; then <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22</a>; after that <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>; then the section of the king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>; next the blessings and the curses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a>, with which he finished the whole section;''and so we find that Joshua, the governor of the people after Moses, read all his laws, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-35.htm">Joshua 8:35</a>; and so did King Josiah at the finding of the book of the law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-2.htm">2 Kings 23:2</a>, and Ezra, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>.
