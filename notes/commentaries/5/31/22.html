Moses is told again that he must shortly die; even those who are most ready and willing to die, need to be often reminded of its coming. The Lord tells Moses, that, after his death, the covenant he had taken so much pains to make between Israel and their God, would certainly be broken. Israel would forsake Him; then God would forsake Israel. Justly does he cast those off who so unjustly cast him off. Moses is directed to deliver them a song, which should remain a standing testimony for God, as faithful to them in giving them warning, and against them, as persons false to themselves in not taking the warning. The word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of men's hearts, and meets them by reproofs and correction. Ministers who preach the word, know not the imaginations of men; but God, whose word it is, knows perfectly.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/31.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A witness for me against them - i. e., an attestation from their own mouths at once of God's benefits, their own duties, and their deserts when they should fall away. Being in verse it would be the more easily learned and kept in memory. The use of songs for such didactic purposes was not unknown to the legislators of antiquity. Compare also the advice of Paul, "teaching and admonishing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-16.htm">Colossians 3:16</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/31.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Now therefore write ye this song&#8212;National songs take deep hold of the memories and have a powerful influence in stirring the deepest feelings of a people. In accordance with this principle in human nature, a song was ordered to be composed by Moses, doubtless under divine inspiration, which was to be learnt by the Israelites themselves and to be taught to their children in every age, embodying the substance of the preceding addresses, and of a strain well suited to inspire the popular mind with a strong sense of God's favor to their nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/31.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/31.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moses therefore wrote this song the same day,.... The same day it was dictated to him by divine inspiration; he wrote it, as Josephus says (d),"in hexameter verse, which he left in the holy Bible or book (the Pentateuch), containing (as he adds) a prophecy of things future, according to which all things have been done, and are done; and in nothing of it has he erred from the truth;''which is a very just account of it, and worthy of observation: <p>and taught it the children of Israel; instructed them in the meaning of it, directed them to repeat it frequently, to lay it up in their memories, and often meditate upon it; as being a divine composition, and of great importance, as the consideration of it will make appear. <p>(d) Antiqu. l. 4. c. 8. sect. 44. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/31.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>.

To this end the Lord appeared in the tabernacle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-15.htm">Deuteronomy 31:15</a>), in a pillar of cloud, which remained standing before it, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-5.htm">Numbers 12:5</a> (see the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>). But before appointing Joshua, He announced to Moses that after his death the nation would go a whoring after other gods, and would break the covenant, for which it would be visited with severe afflictions, and directed him to write an ode and teach it to the children of Israel, that when the apostasy should take place, and punishment from God be felt in consequence, it might speak as a witness against the people, as it would not vanish from their memory. The Lord communicated this commission to Moses in the presence of Joshua, that he also might hear from the mouth of God that the Lord foreknew the future apostasy of the people, and yet nevertheless would bring them into the promised land. In this there was also implied an admonition to Joshua, not only to take care that the Israelites learned the ode and kept it in their memories, but also to strive with all his might to prevent the apostasy, so long as he was leader of Israel; which Joshua did most faithfully to the very end of his life (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/23.htm">Joshua 23</a> and 24). - The announcement of the falling away of the Israelites from the Lord into idolatry, and the burning of the wrath of God in consequence (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-18</a>), serves as a basis for the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-19.htm">Deuteronomy 31:19</a>. In this announcement the different points are simply linked together with "and," whereas in their actual signification they are subordinate to one another: When thou shalt lie with thy fathers, and the people shall rise up, and go a whoring after other gods: My anger will burn against them, etc. &#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, to rise up, to prepare, serves to bring out distinctly the course which the thing would take. The expression, "foreign gods of the land," indicates that in the land which Jehovah gave His people, He (Jehovah) alone was God and Lord, and that He alone was to be worshipped there. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; is in apposition to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, "whither thou comest, in the midst of it." The punishment announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a> corresponds most closely to the sin of the nation. For going a whoring after strange gods, the anger of the Lord would burn against them; for forsaking Him, He would forsake them; and for breaking His covenant, He would hide His face from them, i.e., withdraw His favour from them, so that they would be destroyed. &#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, it (the nation) will be for devouring, i.e., will be devoured or destroyed (see Ewald, 237, c.; and on &#1488;&#1499;&#1500; in this sense, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-16.htm">Deuteronomy 7:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-9.htm">Numbers 14:9</a>). "And many evils and troubles will befall it; and it will say in that day, Do not these evils befall me, because my God is not in the midst of me?" When the evils and troubles broke in upon the nation, the people would inquire the cause, and would find it in the fact that they were forsaken by their God; but the Lord ("but I" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-18.htm">Deuteronomy 31:18</a> forms the antithesis to "they" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-17.htm">Deuteronomy 31:17</a>) would still hide His face, namely, because simply missing God is not true repentance. </body></html>
