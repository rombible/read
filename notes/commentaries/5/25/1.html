In the presence of the judge the man was to be cast down, and the adjudged number of blows were to be given him, not, however, exceeding forty, lest the man should be rendered contemptible in the eyes of the people, as if he were a mere slave or brute. This punishment was usually inflicted with a stick (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-10.htm">Exodus 21:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>, etc.), as is still the case among the Arabs and Egyptians; sometimes also with thorns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-7.htm">Judges 8:7, 16</a>); sometimes with whips and scorpions, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. scourges of cord or leather armed with sharp points or hard knots (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-11.htm">1 Kings 12:11, 14</a>). Though the culprit was laid on the ground, it does not appear that the bastinado was used among the Jews as it is now among the Arabs; the back and shoulders were the parts of the body on which the blows fell (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-13.htm">Proverbs 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-29.htm">Proverbs 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-3.htm">Proverbs 26:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-6.htm">Isaiah 1:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to his fault, by a certain number</span>; literally, <span class="accented">according to the requirement of his crime in number</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. according as his crime deserved. The number was fixed at forty, probably because of the symbolical significance of that number as a measure of completeness. The rabbins fixed the number at thirty-nine, apparently in order that the danger of exceeding the number prescribed by the Law should be diminished (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24</a>); but another reason is assigned by Maimonides, viz. that, as the instrument of punishment was a scourge with three tails, each stroke counted for three, and thus they could not give forty, but only thirty-nine, unless they exceeded the forty (Maimon., 'In Sanhedrin,' 17:2). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against Injustice. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm">Deuteronomy 24:16</a>. Fathers were not to be put to death upon (along with) their sons, nor sons upon (along with) their fathers, i.e., they were not to suffer the punishment of death with them for crimes in which they had no share; but every one was to be punished simply for his own sin. This command was important, to prevent an unwarrantable and abusive application of the law which is manifest in the movements of divine justice to the criminal jurisprudence of the lane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), since it was a common thing among the heathen nations - e.g., the Persians, Macedonians, and others - for the children and families of criminals to be also put to death (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/esther/9-13.htm">Esther 9:13-14</a>; Herod. iii. 19; Ammian Marcell. xxiii. 6; Curtius, vi. 11, 20, etc.).
