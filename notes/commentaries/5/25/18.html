The longer it is before judgement comes, the more dreadful will it be at last. Amalek may remind us of the foes of our souls. May we be enabled to slay all our lusts, all the corruptions both within and without, all the powers of darkness and of the world, which oppose our way to the blessed Saviour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It was not after the spirit or mission of the Law to aim at overcoming inveterate opposition by love and by attempts at conversion (contrast <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-55.htm">Luke 9:55-56</a>). The law taught God's hatred of sin and of rebellion against Him by enjoining the extinction of the obstinate sinner. The Amalekites were a kindred people <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15-16</a>; and living as they did in the peninsula of Sinai, they could not but have well known the mighty acts God had done for His people in Egypt and the Red Sea; yet they manifested from the first a persistent hostility to Israel (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-8.htm">Exodus 17:8</a>, and note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>). They provoked therefore the sentence here pronounced, which was executed at last by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-3.htm">1 Samuel 15:3</a> ff). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17-19. Remember what Amalek did&#8212;This cold-blooded and dastardly atrocity is not narrated in the previous history (Ex 17:14). It was an unprovoked outrage on the laws of nature and humanity, as well as a daring defiance of that God who had so signally shown His favor towards Israel (see on [162]1 Samuel 15; [163]27. 8; [164]30).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Smote the hindmost of thee; </span> which God permitted, both for the punishment of Israel’s sins, and to harden and prepare them for the difficulties of their expedition. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How he met thee by the way,....
