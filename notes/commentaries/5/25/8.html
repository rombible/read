The law on this subject is not unique to the Jews, but is found (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>) in all essential respects the same among various Oriental nations, ancient and modern. The rules in these verses, like those upon divorce, do but incorporate existing immemorial usages, and introduce various wise and politic limitations and mitigations of them. The root of the obligation here imposed upon the brother of the deceased husband lies in the primitive idea of childlessness being a great calamity (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-4.htm">Genesis 16:4</a>; and note), and extinction of name and family one of the greatest that could happen (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-12.htm">Psalm 109:12-15</a>). To avert this the ordinary rules as to intermarriage are in the case in question (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16</a>) set aside. The obligation was onerous (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-6.htm">Ruth 4:6</a>), and might be repugnant; and it is accordingly considerably reduced and restricted by Moses. The duty is recognized as one of affection for the memory of the deceased; it is not one which could be enforced at law. That it continued down to the Christian era is apparent from the question on this point put to Jesus by the Sadducees (see the marginal references).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm">Deuteronomy 25:5</a><p>No child - literally, "no son." The existence of a daughter would clearly suffice. The daughter would inherit the name and property of the father; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1-11</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a stranger: her husband's brother &#8230; shall take her to him to wife&#8212;This usage existed before the age of Moses (Ge 38:8). But the Mosaic law rendered the custom obligatory (Mt 22:25) on younger brothers, or the nearest kinsman, to marry the widow (Ru 4:4), by associating the natural desire of perpetuating a brother's name with the preservation of property in the Hebrew families and tribes. If the younger brother declined to comply with the law, the widow brought her claim before the authorities of the place at a public assembly (the gate of the city); and he having declared his refusal, she was ordered to loose the thong of his shoe&#8212;a sign of degradation&#8212;following up that act by spitting on the ground&#8212;the strongest expression of ignominy and contempt among Eastern people. The shoe was kept by the magistrate as an evidence of the transaction, and the parties separated.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Speak unto him, </span> to convince him of the duty, and persuade him to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If he stand to it; </span> if he obstinately refuse it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the elders of his city shall call him,....
