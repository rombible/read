The sacrifices are a “covering” for the sinner from a punishment of sin. According to Rashi, the prayer in the eighth verse is spoken by the priests; and it seems probable enough.

And their presence was certainly necessary.<p><span class= "bld">And the blood shall be forgiven them.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">shall be covered for them. </span>Not the same expression as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-20.htm" title="And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.">Leviticus 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-26.htm" title="And he shall burn all his fat on the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-31.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it on the altar for a sweet smell to the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-35.htm" title="And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn them on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire to the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he has committed, and it shall be forgiven him.">Leviticus 4:35</a>. But we can hardly follow the Jewish commentators into the question whether, if the perpetrator of the murder were afterwards discovered, the blood of the heifer which had been shed already could be allowed to atone for it, so that the murderer need not be punished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-1.htm" title="If one be found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who has slain him:...">Deuteronomy 21:1-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Lying in the field — </span>Or, in the city, or any place: only the field is named as the place where such murders are most commonly committed. <span class="ital">Thy elders and judges — </span>Those of thy elders who are judges: the judges or rulers of all the neighbouring cities. <span class="ital">Measure — </span>Unless it be evident which city is nearest; for then measuring was superfluous. <span class="ital">Which hath not drawn in the yoke — </span>A fit representation of the murderer, in whose stead it was killed, who would not bear the yoke of God’s laws.

The providence of God has often wonderfully brought to light these hidden works of darkness, and the sin of the guilty has often strangely found them out. The dread of murder should be deeply impressed upon every heart, and all should join in detecting and punishing those who are guilty. The elders were to profess that they had not been any way aiding or abetting the sin. The priests were to pray to God for the country and nation, that God would be merciful. We must empty that measure by our prayers, which others are filling by their sins. All would be taught by this solemnity, to use the utmost care and diligence to prevent, discover, and punish murder. We may all learn from hence to take heed of partaking in other men's sins. And we have fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness, if we do not reprove them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The parenthesis may he more literally rendered "for man is a tree of the field," i. e., has his life from the tree of the field, is supported in life by it (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>).

Expiation of Uncertain Murder.<p>1-6. If one be found slain &#8230; lying in the field, and it be not known who hath slain him&#8212;The ceremonies here ordained to be observed on the discovery of a slaughtered corpse show the ideas of sanctity which the Mosaic law sought to associate with human blood, the horror which murder inspired, as well as the fears that were felt lest God should avenge it on the country at large, and the pollution which the land was supposed to contract from the effusion of innocent, unexpiated blood. According to Jewish writers, the Sanhedrin, taking charge of such a case, sent a deputation to examine the neighborhood. They reported to the nearest town to the spot where the body was found. An order was then issued by their supreme authority to the elders or magistrates of that town, to provide the heifer at the civic expense and go through the appointed ceremonial. The engagement of the public authorities in the work of expiation, the purchase of the victim heifer, the conducting it to a "rough valley" which might be at a considerable distance, and which, as the original implies, was a wady, a perennial stream, in the waters of which the polluting blood would be wiped away from the land, and a desert withal, incapable of cultivation; the washing of the hands, which was an ancient act symbolical of innocence&#8212;the whole of the ceremonial was calculated to make a deep impression on the Jewish, as well as on the Oriental, mind generally; to stimulate the activity of the magistrates in the discharge of their official duties; to lead to the discovery of the criminal, and the repression of crime.How to expiate an uncertain murder, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-1.htm" title="If one be found slain in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who has slain him:...">Deu 21:1-19</a></span>.
