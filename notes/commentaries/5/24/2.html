Divine grace will sanctify this cross, support under it, and teach so to behave, as will gradually render it more tolerable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In this and the next chapter certain particular rights and duties, domestic, social, and civil, are treated. The cases brought forward have often no definite connection, and seem selected in order to illustrate the application of the great principles of the Law in certain important events and circumstances.<p>These four verses contain only one sentence, and should be rendered thus: If a man hath taken a wife, etc., and given her a bill of divorcement and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a> if she has departed out of his house and become another man's wife; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a> if the latter husband hates her, then <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a> her former husband, etc.<p>Moses neither institutes nor enjoins divorce. The exact spirit of the passage is given in our Lord's words to the Jews', "Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>. Not only does the original institution of marriage as recorded by Moses <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> set forth the perpetuity of the bond, but the verses before us plainly intimate that divorce, while tolerated for the time, contravenes the order of nature and of God. The divorced woman who marries again is "defiled" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>, and is grouped in this particular with the adulteress (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>). Our Lord then was speaking according to the spirit of the law of Moses when he declared, "Whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>. He was speaking too not less according to the mind of the prophets (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>). But Moses could not absolutely put an end to a practice which was traditional, and common to the Jews with other Oriental nations. His aim is therefore to regulate and thus to mitigate an evil which he could not extirpate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>De 24:1-22. Of Divorces.<p>1-4. When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes&#8212;It appears that the practice of divorces was at this early period very prevalent amongst the Israelites, who had in all probability become familiar with it in Egypt [Lane]. The usage, being too deep-rooted to be soon or easily abolished, was tolerated by Moses (Mt 19:8). But it was accompanied under the law with two conditions, which were calculated greatly to prevent the evils incident to the permitted system; namely: (1) The act of divorcement was to be certified on a written document, the preparation of which, with legal formality, would afford time for reflection and repentance; and (2) In the event of the divorced wife being married to another husband, she could not, on the termination of that second marriage, be restored to her first husband, however desirous he might be to receive her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> For although he could not causelessly put her away without sin, yet she being put away, and forsaken by her husband, might marry another without sin, as is determined in the same or a like case, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart.
