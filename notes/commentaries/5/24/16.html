It was not observed by the Persians in the case of Daniel’s accusers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm" title="And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.">Daniel 6:24</a>).<p>The case of Achan, who “perished not alone in his iniquity,” falls under a different head.

By the civil magistrates, for sins committed by them of a capital nature, and which are worthy of death: <p>neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers; for sins committed by them that deserve it: <p>every man shall be put to death for his own sin: which is but just and reasonable; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>; which is no contradiction to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>; that respects what God himself would do, this what Israel, or the civil magistrates in it, should do; this is a command on Israel, as Aben Ezra observes; that the declaration of the sovereign Being, who is not bound by any law. Jarchi interprets these words differently, as that the one should not be put to death by the testimony of the other; and it is a rule with the Jews,"that an oath of witness is taken of men, and not of women; of those that are not akin, and not of those that are nearly related (p):''on which one of the commentators observes (q) that such that are near akin are not fit to bear testimony, because it is written, "the father shall not be put to death for the children"; that is, for the testimony of the children. Jarchi indeed mentions the other sense, for the sins of the children, which has been given, and is undoubtedly the true sense of the text. The Targum of Jonathan gives both;"fathers should not be put to death, neither by the testimony, nor for the sins of the children; and children shall not be put to death, neither by the testimony, nor for the sins of fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin by proper witnesses.'' <p>(p) Misn.

Responsibility for Crime is Individual. The opposition of this principle to that which prevailed in many ancient nations (Herod. iii. 119, <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/9-13.htm" title="Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according to this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on the gallows.">Esther 9:13</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-24.htm" title="And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions, them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the mastery of them, and broke all their bones in pieces or ever they came at the bottom of the den.">Daniel 6:24</a> (25)), and which seems to have prevailed in Israel (JE, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-24.htm" title="And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold, and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses, and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they brought them to the valley of Achor.">Joshua 7:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-26.htm" title="Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.">2 Kings 9:26</a>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-6.htm" title="And every beast that parts the hoof, and separates the cleft into two claws, and chews the cud among the beasts, that you shall eat.">Deuteronomy 14:6</a>), when the family was regarded as a moral unit, and the children were put to death with their father in expiation of his crime, is very striking, and the more so that the ethical solidarity of the nation is so constantly assumed by D. It has therefore been doubted whether the law belonged originally to D. Some take it as dependent on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm" title="In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.">Jeremiah 31:29</a>, or Ezekiel 18 on the ground that the principle of individual responsibility is there proclaimed as if for the first time, in opposition to the older ideas. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm" title="But the children of the murderers he slew not: according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moses, wherein the LORD commanded, saying, The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, nor the children be put to death for the fathers; but every man shall be put to death for his own sin.">2 Kings 14:6</a> records that Amaziah when putting to death the assassins of his father did not also slay their children—apparently an innovation on the usual practice. The deuteronomic editor of Kings quotes D’s law as the King’s authority for his clemency. But general laws so often rose from individual cases that it is possible that this law (which is not found in any other code) was the result of Amaziah’s innovating example, and is, therefore, one of the several incorporated by D from earlier sources. Note that it is not in the direct form of address nor otherwise deuteronomic in its phrasing.

Marcell., 23. 6; Curtius, 6:11, 20; Claudian, 'In Eutrop.,' 2:478; Cicero, 'Epist. ad Brut.,' 12, 15). Such severity of retribution is here prohibited in the penal code of the Israelites. Though God, in the exercise of his absolute sovereignty, might visit the sins of the parent upon the children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), earthly judges were not to assume this power. Only the transgressor himself was to bear the penalty of his sin (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-6.htm">2 Kings 14:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Warning against oppressing the Poor. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-11.htm">Deuteronomy 24:11</a>. If a loan of any kind was lent to a neighbour, the lender was not to go into his house to pledge (take) a pledge, but was to let the borrower bring the pledge out. The meaning is, that they were to leave it to the borrower to give a pledge, and not compel him to give up something as a pledge that might be indispensable to him. </body></html>
