Here is a beneficent provision for the poor. Every forgotten sheaf in the harvest-field was to lie; the olive tree was not to be beaten a second time; nor were grapes to be gathered, in order that, in collecting what remained, the hearts of the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow might be gladdened by the bounty of Providence.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When thou beatest thine olive tree</span> with staves, as they used to do to fetch down the olives. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>When thou beatest thine olive tree,....
