Jarchi says, the phrase "in thy land" is intended to comprehend the hire of beasts, and of vessels; and these in the Misnah (o) are said to be comprehended in this precept, as well as the hire of man. <p>(o) Bava Metzia, c. 9. sect. 12. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/24.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">poor and needy</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm" title="For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I command you, saying, You shall open your hand wide to your brother, to your poor, and to your needy, in your land.">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">within thy gates</span>] See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm" title="You may not eat within your gates the tithe of your corn, or of your wine, or of your oil, or the firstborn of your herds or of your flock, nor any of your vows which you vow, nor your freewill offerings, or heave offering of your hand:">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>.

The command, "Take heed by the plague of leprosy to observe diligently and to do according to all that the priests teach thee," etc., does not mean, that when they saw signs of leprosy they were to be upon their guard, to observe everything that the priests directed them, as Knobel and many others suppose. For, in the first place, the reference to the punishment of Miriam with leprosy is by no means appropriate to such a thought as this, since Miriam did not act in opposition to the priests after she had been smitten with leprosy, but brought leprosy upon herself as a punishment, by her rebellion against Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-10.htm">Numbers 12:10</a>.). And in the second place, this view cannot be reconciled with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1490;&#1506; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, since &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512; with &#1489;&#1468;, either to be upon one's guard against (before) anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>), or when taken in connection with &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to beware by the soul, i.e., for the sake of the worth of the soul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-21.htm">Jeremiah 17:21</a>). The thought here, therefore, is, "Be on thy guard because of the plague of leprosy," i.e., that thou dost not get it, have to bear it, as the reward for thy rebellion against what the priests teach according to the commandment of the Lord. "Watch diligently, that thou do not incur the plague of leprosy" (Vulgate); or, "that thou do not sin, so as to be punished with leprosy" (J. H. Michaelis).</body></html>
