The cases brought forward have often no definite connection, and seem selected in order to illustrate the application of the great principles of the Law in certain important events and circumstances.<p>These four verses contain only one sentence, and should be rendered thus: If a man hath taken a wife, etc., and given her a bill of divorcement and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-2.htm">Deuteronomy 24:2</a> if she has departed out of his house and become another man's wife; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a> if the latter husband hates her, then <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a> her former husband, etc.<p>Moses neither institutes nor enjoins divorce. The exact spirit of the passage is given in our Lord's words to the Jews', "Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-8.htm">Matthew 19:8</a>. Not only does the original institution of marriage as recorded by Moses <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-24.htm">Genesis 2:24</a> set forth the perpetuity of the bond, but the verses before us plainly intimate that divorce, while tolerated for the time, contravenes the order of nature and of God. The divorced woman who marries again is "defiled" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-4.htm">Deuteronomy 24:4</a>, and is grouped in this particular with the adulteress (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-20.htm">Leviticus 18:20</a>). Our Lord then was speaking according to the spirit of the law of Moses when he declared, "Whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a>. He was speaking too not less according to the mind of the prophets (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/2-14.htm">Malachi 2:14-16</a>). But Moses could not absolutely put an end to a practice which was traditional, and common to the Jews with other Oriental nations. His aim is therefore to regulate and thus to mitigate an evil which he could not extirpate. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>De 24:1-22. Of Divorces.<p>1-4. When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes&#8212;It appears that the practice of divorces was at this early period very prevalent amongst the Israelites, who had in all probability become familiar with it in Egypt [Lane]. The usage, being too deep-rooted to be soon or easily abolished, was tolerated by Moses (Mt 19:8). But it was accompanied under the law with two conditions, which were calculated greatly to prevent the evils incident to the permitted system; namely: (1) The act of divorcement was to be certified on a written document, the preparation of which, with legal formality, would afford time for reflection and repentance; and (2) In the event of the divorced wife being married to another husband, she could not, on the termination of that second marriage, be restored to her first husband, however desirous he might be to receive her.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This is the punishment of his levity and injustice in putting her away without sufficient cause, which by this offer he now acknowledgeth. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">After that she is defiled; </span> not simply and absolutely, as if her second marriage were a sin, but respectively, or as to her first husband, to whom she is as a defiled or unclean woman, that is, forbidden; for things forbidden are accounted and called unclean, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm" title="But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.">Judges 13:7</a></span>, because they may no more be touched or used than an unclean thing. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou shalt not cause the land to sin, </span> i.e. thou shalt not suffer such abominable lightness and lewdness to be practised, lest the people be polluted, and the land defiled and accursed by that means. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Her former husband which sent her away may not take her again to be his wife,.... Though ever so desirous of it, and having heartily repented that he had put her away: this is the punishment of his fickleness and inconstancy, and was ordered to make men cautious how they put away their wives; since when they had so done, and they had been married to another, they could not enjoy them again even on the death of the second husband; yea, though she was only espoused to him, and he had never lain with her, as Ben Melech observes, it was forbidden the former husband to marry her; though if she had only played the whore, according to the same writer, and others (a), she might return to him: <p>after that she is defiled; not by whoredom, for in that case she was not forbidden, as it is interpreted, but by her being married to another man; when she was defiled, not by him, or with respect to him, nor with regard to any other man, whom she might lawfully marry after the decease of her latter husband; but with respect to her first husband, being by her divorce from him, and by her marriage to another, entirely alienated and separated from him, and so prohibited to him; and thus R. Joseph Kimchi interprets this defilement of prohibition, things prohibited being reckoned unclean, or not lawful to be used: <p>for that is abomination before the Lord; for a man to take his wife again, after she had been divorced by him, and married to another man; and yet, such is the grace and goodness of God to his backsliding people, that he receives them when they return unto him their first husband, and forsake other lovers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-1.htm">Jeremiah 3:1</a>, <p>and thou shalt not cause the land to sin which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance; since if this was allowed, that men might put away their wives, and take them again at pleasure, and change them as often as they thought fit, no order could be observed, and the utmost confusion in families introduced, and lewdness encouraged, and which would subject the land and the inhabitants of it to many evils and calamities, as the just punishment thereof. <p>(a) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

But the natural meaning is that she is unclean to the former husband by her union with the latter. It cannot be a matter of indifference to him that she has been another’s, as (presumably) the popular humour took it. Such easy passage of a woman from one man to another did defile her: it is <span class="ital">an abomination before Jehovah</span> (notice the peculiar construction <span class="ital">before</span> and the absence of <span class="ital">thy God</span> after the divine name). She was, therefore, <span class="ital">taboo</span>, or unlawful to her first husband. Marti suggests that the <span class="ital">uncleanness</span> may have a demonistic origin (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/22-9.htm" title="You shall not sow your vineyard with divers seeds: lest the fruit of your seed which you have sown, and the fruit of your vineyard, be defiled....">Deuteronomy 22:9-11</a>).

The prohibition of a return of the wife to her first husband, as well as the necessity of a formal bill of divorcement being given to the woman before she could be sent away, could not fail to be checks on the license of divorce, as doubtless they were intended to be. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Vows vowed to the Lord were to be fulfilled without delay; but omitting to vow was not a sin.
