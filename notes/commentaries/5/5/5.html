These ‘Words’ show a few striking parallels to the Ten Words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[121] On this distinction between the ‘words’ and the ‘judgements,’ see Driver’s <span class="ital">Exodus</span>, 202, 252 ff.; and the Oxford <span class="ital">Hexateuch</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>J also records a Covenant at Sinai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-10.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all your people I will do marvels, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which you are shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with you.">Exodus 34:10</a>, based upon ‘Words,’ 11–27, which have been called ‘a second Decalogue.’ But they are rather parallel to E’s Covenant words, and like them are more in number than ten. (See the notes to Exodus 34) The phrase ‘ten words’ in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-28.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.">Deuteronomy 5:28</a></span> is probably a gloss.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In D’s edition of the Ten Words now before us we find again all the features of E’s edition except the last sentence of the 4th commandment, the sentence which reflects P (another of the many facts which support the argument that P is later than D). Instead another reason is assigned to the commandment in the language, and characteristic of the humane spirit, of D. In the same commandment D has its common <span class="ital">keep</span> or <span class="ital">observe</span> for E’s <span class="ital">remember</span>, and adds the clauses <span class="ital">as Jehovah thy God commanded thee, nor thine ox nor thine ass nor any of</span> (<span class="ital">thy cattle</span>); in the 5th it adds the phrases <span class="ital">as Jehovah thy God hath commanded thee</span> and <span class="ital">that it may go well with thee</span>; in the 9th it gives a wider term <span class="ital">groundless</span> or <span class="ital">vain</span> for E’s <span class="ital">false</span>; and in the 10th it adds to and rearranges the details with a finer ethical discrimination, using two verbs for <span class="ital">covet</span> or <span class="ital">desire</span>, and putting <span class="ital">the wife of thy neighbour</span> first and by herself, distinct from the rest of his household. Further, D asserts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm" title="These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) in contradiction to E that the Ten Words were the only words spoken to Israel at Ḥoreb; and adds that He wrote them on two tables of stone. Note, also, that in D the Ten Words are introduced as a quotation in the Sg. form of address in a discourse which uses throughout the Pl.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>P does not record the Ten Words. The legislation which it assigns to Sinai, Exodus 25-31 (with a variant edition 35–40), consists of directions, given to Moses on the Mount and afterwards proclaimed to the people, as to the sanctuary and priesthood (see Driver on these passages). The only parallel which this legislation offers to the Decalogue is the law of the Sabbath (Exo 31:22-27, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/35-1.htm" title="And Moses gathered all the congregation of the children of Israel together, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD has commanded, that you should do them.">Exodus 35:1</a> ff.). But P mentions incidentally the Testimony <span class="ital">which I shall give thee</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-16.htm" title="And you shall put into the ark the testimony which I shall give you.">Exodus 25:16</a>) and says that <span class="ital">God gave unto Moses when He had made an end of communing with him upon Mount Sinai the two tables of the testimony</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such are the principal data of the various traditions of the legislation at Sinai-Ḥoreb. They start serious questions of literary construction and historical fact, to which several hypothetical, but no certain, answers are possible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question which mainly concerns us here is that of the relation of the two editions of the Ten Words in E and D. To the argument that because so much else of law and narrative in D is based on E, therefore D must also have derived the Ten Words from E, there are the following objections: (1) E’s edition has not only many deuteronomic phrases, but in the 4th commandment reflects P; while D’s is in style and spirit consistently deuteronomic. (2) E connects the Covenant at Ḥoreb not with the Ten Words but with others. (3) These other Words, while offering some parallels to the Ten, are of a distinctly less spiritual character and apparently from a more primitive stage of ethical development; and it is difficult to conceive that E could have first recorded the Decalogue as given at Ḥoreb and then based the Covenant there on other words of an inferior character. (4) Nor is it clear that E’s narrative of the theophany, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/19-14.htm" title="And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes....">Exodus 19:14-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm" title="And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and waxed louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.">Exodus 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-18.htm" title="And all the people saw the thunder, and the lightning, and the noise of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking: and when the people saw it, they removed, and stood afar off....">Exodus 20:18-21</a>, implies that the people heard from God any articulate words at all, before Moses (because of their apprehension that God would speak directly to them) entered the darkness out of which His thunder had come and received for them the Words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-22.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, You have seen that I have talked with you from heaven....">Exodus 20:22-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/23-10.htm" title="And six years you shall sow your land, and shall gather in the fruits thereof:...">Exodus 23:10-33</a>) on which the Covenant was based.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On these grounds a strong case has been made out for the hypothesis that E did not originally contain the Ten Words; that these were the work of the deuteronomic school, based on the teaching of the 8th century prophets and expressed throughout in deuteronomic phraseology; that D, while borrowing from E the tradition of a Covenant at Ḥoreb, substituted them as the basis of that Covenant for the other words which E had connected with it, or else did not know of those other words in E, for he distinctly asserts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm" title="These words the LORD spoke to all your assembly in the mount out of the middle of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me.">Deuteronomy 5:22</a>) that God added no others to the Ten at Ḥoreb; and finally that a late editor, with both D and P before him, intruded the Ten Words into E repeating most of their deuteronomic phraseology, but substituting in the 4th commandment for one of D’s phrases a phrase based on P. This hypothesis finds support in the substance of the Decalogue, which it is maintained is suitable for an agricultural and not for a nomadic people; and especially in the prohibition of graven images, the early date of which is difficult if not impossible to reconcile with the use of images in Israel before the 8th century and particularly in the N. kingdom in which E was composed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>All the data, however, do not thus support the hypothesis of the priority of D’s Decalogue. It may not be certain that E’s <span class="ital">remember the sabbath-day</span> is earlier than D’s <span class="ital">keep</span> or <span class="ital">observe</span>, nor is E’s <span class="ital">false witness</span> necessarily more primitive than the wider <span class="ital">vain</span>, or <span class="ital">groundless</span>, which D employs—although they would appear to be so (with the former cp. J’s <span class="ital">remember</span> in the same sense, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm" title="And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which you came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten.">Exodus 13:3</a>). But D’s form for the 10th commandment, because more developed and of a finer ethical standard, is almost certainly later than E’s; and so are the additions to the 4th and 5th commandments. Further, in the E edition the name of the Deity even in association with creation is not Elohim, but Jehovah.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This, however, only leads to the further question whether behind both editions there was not an earlier and much simpler form. In both the Ten Words are of very unequal length. In the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th and 10th the excesses over the others are hortatory enforcements in the language of D and in harmony with D’s usual method of elaborating his materials and adding reasons and enforcements: <span class="ital">teaching</span> and <span class="ital">expounding</span> the Law to use his own terms. Remove these excesses and there remain, besides the preface, Ten Words of similar length and divisible into two tables of virtually equal size.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I am Jehovah [thy God which brought thee out of the land of Egypt out of the house of slaves].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt have no other gods before Me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not make thee a graven image.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not take the name of Jehovah in vain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Remember the sabbath day to keep it holy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Honour thy father and thy mother.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt do no murder.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not commit adultery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not steal.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not bear false witness [against thy neighbour].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thou shalt not covet [thy neighbour’s house].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To sum up—it appears necessary to postulate some such brief form of the Ten Words as prior to the editions of them in E and D on these grounds: that all of the contents of these editions which is over and above this form consists of easily separable expansions of a hortatory or explanatory character, expressed in the language and the spirit of D; and that it was the general practice of D thus to expand, refine and enforce the materials of earlier traditions. Also D treats the Ten Words as a quotation (see above).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whether this pre-deuteronomic Decalogue was originally part of E is more than doubtful. In E there is neither room nor reason for any ‘Words’ at Ḥoreb before those on which E bases the Covenant; nor any trace that the Divine voice became at all articulate before the latter were spoken. The double tradition of E and J is that the Covenant ‘Words’ spoken by God in Ḥoreb-Sinai, while offering certain parallels to the Decalogue, were more primitive than this. And that excludes the only possible alternative theory, that, if these ‘Words,’ now associated in E with the Covenant, along with ‘the judgements’ that are embedded within their two sections, were originally assigned to Israel’s residence in Moab, their removal to the Ḥoreb period (see above) displaced the Decalogue from its association with the Ḥoreb Covenant and pushed it forward to a point in the narrative at which it has no proper connection with its context.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the literary data, therefore, the most probable conclusion is that the Decalogue came to D from a source independent of J and E. Whether its origin was earlier than E and may even have been Mosaic or was later, and in fact the result of the teaching of the 8th century prophets, are far more difficult questions; for which answers must be sought, not in the literary forms, so much as in the substantial ideas, of the Decalogue. The theory that the Decalogue is later than E gets rid of the historical difficulties for an early date for the 2nd commandment which arise from the use of images by leaders in Israel and especially in the N. kingdom, without any rebuke from prophets before the 8th century, and for an early date for the 4th commandment as one impossible of fulfilment by, and therefore unnatural to prescribe to, a people still in the pastoral stage of culture. And if J and E’s record of a more primitive form of Covenant words at Ḥoreb be regarded as reliable this is also a reason for assigning the Decalogue to a later stage in Israel’s social and ethical development. On the other hand, there are good grounds for the <span class="ital">possibility</span> of the prohibition of images as early as Moses. Not only do the ‘Words’ assigned by E to the Covenant at Ḥoreb forbid gods of silver and gold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm" title="You shall not make with me gods of silver, neither shall you make to you gods of gold.">Exodus 20:23</a>) and by J <span class="ital">molten gods</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-17.htm" title="You shall make you no molten gods.">Exodus 34:17</a>); but E and J never impute the use of images to the Patriarchs, while E (Exodus 32) records Moses’ anger and God’s threat to destroy the people because of the golden calf which they had fashioned. More significant is the absence from all the historical records of any mention of an image in connection with the Ark, or the sanctuary at Shiloh or Gibeon or Jerusalem, or other place before the disruption of the kingdom. As to the Sabbath-law, the presumably oldest form of it is perfectly possible for a purely pastoral people; while the fuller forms, though evidently designed for an agricultural people, could not be literally observed even by them (unless the Heb. term for <span class="ital">work</span> be limited to field-work), because they continued to have flocks and herds. As for the other Commandments there is not one of them in its shorter form which makes a date for it impossible before the settlement of Israel in Canaan—not even the first commandment, for it merely forbids the worship of any gods but Jehovah (henolatry), and does not assert His sole deity (monotheism). The <span class="ital">possibility</span> of the Mosaic origin of the Decalogue is, therefore, clear so far as its ideals are concerned. The real difficulty with regard to it rests upon its superiority to the ‘Words’ which the other traditions describe as the laws of the Covenant at Ḥoreb. See further ‘The Date of the Decalogue,’ App. IV. to Driver’s <span class="ital">Exodus</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From whatever source the deuteronomists derived the Decalogue it is interesting that they developed it in more than one edition. For this we shall find analogies in their practice with regard to other laws (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you....">Deuteronomy 5:12-26</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Decalogue with its Preface has been variously arranged and divided. The LXX (cod. B) makes the commandment against adultery follow immediately on that to honour parents, thus naturally bringing together the two commandments which concern family life: in Ex. that against murder follows, but in D precedes, that against theft. In the N.T. the order varies, following the Heb. order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:">Matthew 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-27.htm" title="You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not commit adultery:">Matthew 5:27</a>[122] (so far as murder and adultery are concerned), <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-18.htm" title="And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold, if the witness be a false witness, and has testified falsely against his brother;">Deuteronomy 19:18</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-19.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not, Honor your father and mother.">Mark 10:19</a>; but the Greek of D in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-20.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.">Luke 18:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>. The Talmud takes the Preface as the 1st commandment and the prohibitions of other gods and of images as together the 2nd, on the ground presumably that the reason annexed to the latter is equally, or even more, suitable to the former. This conjunction was accepted by Augustine and through him by the Roman and Lutheran Churches, but they keep the Preface as such and divide the 10th commandment into two (though the latter half as we have seen is not original). Philo, Josephus, Origen and other fathers, the Greek and Reformed Churches and most modern scholars divide as follows: Preface; 1, Other gods; 2, Images; 3, Name of Jehovah; 4, Sabbath; 5, Parents; 6, Murder; 7, Adultery; 8, Theft; 9, False witness; 10, Covetousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[122] So R.V.; but A.V. following Another text has the order: adultery, murder. Matthew, Mark and Luke all give the 5th Commandment after the 6th–9th.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With regard to the scope and spirit of the Ten Words it is enough to say that they lay down the double duty of Israelites towards God and towards men: religion and morality. The duty towards God is expressed with regard to the special temptations of the people at the time—the belief that there were other gods actually existent and with divine powers and spheres of action, and the custom of worshipping the deity in images. The 1st commandment is not the expression of a pure monotheism, and it is remarkable that the deuteronomists did not expand it as well as those which follow it (but see below on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-7.htm" title="You shall have none other gods before me.">Deuteronomy 5:7</a></span>). Yet it has been found a suitable statement, not only of the sovereignty but of the oneness of the Deity. Similarly the 2nd has been understood as a statement of His spirituality. The 3rd forbids the irreverence which is the sin equally of the ignorant and careless and of the familiar but formal worshipper. Duty towards men is covered in its main aspects in the life of the family and of society by the 5th to the 10th ‘Words,’ the last adding the sphere of thought and feeling to that of action detailed in the others. Between these two groups the 4th commandment forms the transition, for while it expresses man’s due to God in setting apart a regular portion of time to Him, it also in its expanded form enforces that the Sabbath was equally a duty to himself, his family, and his dependents. How fine and true was the instinct of the deuteronomists in thus expanding the Sabbath-law is shown by the saying of Christ that the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath2[123].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[123] The following may he noted among the Christian expositions of the theological and ethical contents of the Decalogue.
