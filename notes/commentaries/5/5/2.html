The covenant to which Moses refers is not that made with Abraham, but that made at Sinai, with Israel as a people; and though the individuals who were then present had all perished with the exception of Moses, Joshua, and Caleb, the nation survived, and as it was with the nation as an organic whole that the covenant had been made. it might be with propriety said that it was made with those whom Moses addressed at this time, inasmuch as they constituted the nation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Announcement of the Discourse upon the Law. - First of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-44.htm">Deuteronomy 4:44</a>, we have the general notice in the form of a heading: "This is the Thorah which Moses set before the children of Israel;" and then, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-45.htm">Deuteronomy 4:45</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>, a fuller description of the Thorah according to its leading features, "testimonies, statutes, and rights" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>), together with a notice of the place and time at which Moses delivered this address. "On their coming out of Egypt," i.e., not "after they had come out," but during the march, before they had reached the goal of their journeyings, viz., (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>) when they were still on the other side of the Jordan. "In the valley," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-29.htm">Deuteronomy 3:29</a>. "In the land of Sihon," and therefore already upon ground which the Lord had given them for a possession. The importance of this possession as the first-fruit and pledge of the fulfilment of the further promises of God, led Moses to mention again, though briefly, the defeat of the two kings of the Amorites, together with the conquest of their land, just as he had done before in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32-36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-17</a>.
