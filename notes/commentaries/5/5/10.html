The promise of His presence with us through the “other Comforter” compensates for the absence of any visible image. As <span class= "ital">love </span>in this verse is practical, so is <span class= "ital">hatred </span>in the previous verse. To hate God is to disobey His commandments.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:6-22 There is some variation here from Ex 20 as between the Lord's prayer in Mt 6 and Lu 11. It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a> and notes.<p>Moses here adopts the Ten Words as a ground from which he may proceed to reprove, warn, and exhort; and repeats them, with a certain measure of freedom and adaptation.

The word of Jehovah, which Moses as mediator had to announce to the people, had reference not to the instructions which preceded the promulgation of the decalogue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-11.htm">Exodus 19:11</a>.), but, as is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-31</a>, primarily to the further communications which the Lord was about to address to the nation in connection with the conclusion of the covenant, besides the ten words (viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-1.htm">Exodus 22:1-23:33</a>), to which in fact the whole of the Sinaitic legislation really belongs, as being the further development of the covenant laws. The alarm of the people at the fire is more fully described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm">Deuteronomy 5:25</a>. The word "saying" at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a> is dependent upon the word "talked" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-4.htm">Deuteronomy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-5.htm">Deuteronomy 5:5</a> simply containing a parenthetical remark. </body></html>
