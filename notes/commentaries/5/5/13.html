It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exhortation to observe the Sabbath and allow time of rest to servants (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) is pointed by reminding the people that they too were formerly servants themselves. The bondage in Egypt and the deliverance from it are not assigned as grounds for the institution of the Sabbath, which is of far older date (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>), but rather as suggesting motives for the religious observance of that institution. The Exodus was an entrance into rest from the toils of the house of bondage, and is thought actually to have occurred on the Sabbath day or "rest" day.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

Or observe it, by setting it apart as a time of natural rest, and for the performance of holy and religious exercises; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-8.htm">Exodus 20:8</a>, where the phrase is a little varied, "remember the sabbath day to keep it holy"; it having been instituted before: <p>as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee; not at Sinai only, for the same might then have been observed of all the rest of the commands, but before the giving of the law, at the first of the manna; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/16-23.htm">Exodus 16:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Six days <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:</span><p>(f) Meaning, since God permits six days for our labours, we should willingly dedicate the seventh to serve him wholly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In vv. 6-21, the ten covenant words are repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>, with only a few variations, which have already been discussed in connection with the exposition of the decalogue at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-14</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-33</a>, Moses expounds still further the short account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>, viz., that after the people had heard the ten covenant words, in their alarm at the awful phenomena in which the Lord revealed His glory, they entreated him to stand between as mediator, that God Himself might not speak to them any further, and that they might not die, and then promised that they would hearken to all that the Lord should speak to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a> -31). His purpose in doing so was to link on the exhortation in vv. 32, 33, to keep all the commandments of the Lord and do them, which paves the way for passing to the exposition of the law which follows. "A great voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>) is an adverbial accusative, signifying "with a great voice" (cf. Ges. 118, 3). "And He added no more:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>. God spoken the ten words directly to the people, and then no more; i.e., everything further He addressed to Moses alone, and through his mediation to the people. As mediator He gave him the two tables of stone, upon which He had written the decalogue (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). This statement somewhat forestalls the historical course; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10-11</a>, it is repeated again in its proper historical connection. </body></html>
