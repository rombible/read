The metaphor is hardly an instance of the tendency of D’s style to hyperbole2[120].

And he wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them to me....">Deuteronomy 5:22-27</a></span>). But if not a hyperbole the phrase <span class="ital">face to face</span> needs qualification—it was only with Moses that God talked (morally speaking) face to face (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend.

God spoke to them immediately, in their presence and to their face, from the mount, as one person might to another. There is a slight difference in form between the phrase here and that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>, where it is used in reference to Moses, but it is so slight (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span> instead of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>) that no difference of meaning can be elicited. <span class="accented">God</span> spake directly to the people, as he did to Moses, only Moses was admitted to closer communion with him than the people were. This difference is sufficiently indicated in ver. 5, where the mediatory function of Moses, in the promulgation of the Law and the making of the covenant, is described as necessitated by the fear of the people, and their not going up into the mount (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-19.htm">Exodus 19:19</a>, etc.).
