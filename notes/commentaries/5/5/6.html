It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a> and notes.<p>Moses here adopts the Ten Words as a ground from which he may proceed to reprove, warn, and exhort; and repeats them, with a certain measure of freedom and adaptation.

I am the Lord thy God&#8212;The word "Lord" is expressive of authority or dominion; and God, who by natural claim as well as by covenant relation was entitled to exercise supremacy over His people Israel, had a sovereign right to establish laws for their government. [See on [115]Ex 20:2.] The commandments which follow are, with a few slight verbal alterations, the same as formerly recorded (Ex 20:1-17), and in some of them there is a distinct reference to that promulgation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The ten commandments, delivered <span class="bld"> Exo 20</span>, are here repeated with some small difference of words, but the sense is perfectly the same, and therefore the explication of them must be fetched thence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I am the Lord thy God,....

The phrases used, though occurring much more frequently in D, are also found (either exactly as here or with grammatical variations) in J and E (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm" title="I am the LORD your God, which have brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.">Exodus 20:2</a>); so it is difficult to say whether the original form was simply <span class="ital">I am Jehovah</span> or the long one before us. A Preface longer than each of the separate <span class="ital">words</span> is not unnatural; yet the original may have been simply <span class="ital">I am Jehovah thy God</span> as in ch. 6.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Preface states the Lawgiver’s Name, and His obligations upon Israel, ‘whereby He prepares their minds for obedience1[124],’ by calling on their loyalty and gratitude. This tenderness of the Preface (Matthew Henry contrasts it with the awfulness of the Theophany from which it issues) and its appeal to high motives are characteristic of D. But in all the traditions of the origins of Israel’s religion the note of redemption is fundamental; Grace is prior to Law, God’s saving deeds to His commandments. The stress laid upon the Preface by theologians in their practical application of the Decalogue to Christianity is therefore just. The form of the Preface is similar to the opening phrases on several Semitic royal monuments: the Moabite stone, ‘I am Mesha son of Kemosh’; the Byblus stele, ‘I am Yeḥawmilk, King of Gebal, etc.’; the Sidon sarcophagus, ‘I am Tabnith … King of the Sidonians, etc.’ But see Driver, <span class="ital">Sam.</span>2 p. xxiv.

"On their coming out of Egypt," i.e., not "after they had come out," but during the march, before they had reached the goal of their journeyings, viz., (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>) when they were still on the other side of the Jordan.

"In the land of Sihon," and therefore already upon ground which the Lord had given them for a possession. The importance of this possession as the first-fruit and pledge of the fulfilment of the further promises of God, led Moses to mention again, though briefly, the defeat of the two kings of the Amorites, together with the conquest of their land, just as he had done before in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-32.htm">Deuteronomy 2:32-36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1-17</a>.
