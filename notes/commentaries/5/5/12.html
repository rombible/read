The introduction and the close of the command, which gives the reason for it, are different here. The reason drawn from the creation is not mentioned; the reason drawn from the exodus is. This fact illustrates the observation that in Deuteronomy we find “the Gospel of the Pentateuch.” If for the exodus of Israel we substitute here “the exodus of Christ, which He accomplished at Jerusalem,” not so much by His <span class= "ital">death as by His resurrection, </span>we have a reason for keeping <span class= "ital">not the Sabbath, but the Lord’s Day.</span><p>It is worth while to observe that the Israelites had express authority given them to <span class= "ital">enforce the observance of the Sabbath upon Gentiles, </span>when these could be regarded as “strangers within their gates.” The words <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-6.htm" title="Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his servants, every one that keeps the sabbath from polluting it, and takes hold of my covenant;">Isaiah 56:6</a> seem to show that “strangers” who “took hold of the covenant” of Jehovah were expected to “keep His sabbath from polluting it.” For an example of its enforcement, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-16.htm" title="There dwelled men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath to the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.">Nehemiah 13:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/nehemiah/13-20.htm" title="So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.">Nehemiah 13:20-21</a>.<p>If any difficulty is felt at the variation of the form of the commandment from that which we have in Exodus, it should be observed, first, that the <span class= "ital">command itself is not altered, </span>as appears by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/5-13.htm" title="Six days you shall labor, and do all your work:">Deuteronomy 5:13-14</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/20-9.htm" title="Six days shall you labor, and do all your work:">Exodus 20:9-10</a>; and secondly, that in this exhortation Moses calls Israel to hear the statutes and judgments which he, as their mediator, commands them, and that he is free to enforce them by such reasons as may seem to him best.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.">Deuteronomy 5:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it — </span>Dost thou do no work on this day, which can be done as well on another?

It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm. How sweet is it to a soul truly distressed under the terrors of a broken law, to hear the mild and soul-reviving language of the gospel!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exhortation to observe the Sabbath and allow time of rest to servants (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm">Exodus 23:12</a>) is pointed by reminding the people that they too were formerly servants themselves. The bondage in Egypt and the deliverance from it are not assigned as grounds for the institution of the Sabbath, which is of far older date (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>), but rather as suggesting motives for the religious observance of that institution. The Exodus was an entrance into rest from the toils of the house of bondage, and is thought actually to have occurred on the Sabbath day or "rest" day.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The Sabbath was to be kept by being <span class="accented">sanctified</span>. This means that it was to be consecrated to God to be used as he had appointed. The sanctification of any object "always goes back to an act of the Divine will, to Divine election and institution. In other words, it is always a state in which the creature [or institute] is bound to God by the appointment of God himself, which is expressed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b9;&#x5d3;&#x5b6;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5b4;&#x5e7;&#x5b0;&#x5d3;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b4;&#x5d3;&#x5bc;&#x5b5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;</span>, XXX" (Oehler, 'Theology of the Old Testament,' vol. 1. p. 155). The sanctification of the Sabbath, accordingly, was the consecration of that day to the Lord, to be observed as he had enjoined, that is, as a day of rest from all servile work and ordinary occupations. Among the Jews, those who were careful to keep this law "rested the Sabbath day according to the commandment" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-56.htm">Luke 23:56</a>). Not, however, in mere indolence and idle vacancy, unworthy of a man. Not thus could the day be sanctified to the Lord. Man had to "release his soul and body from all their burdens, with all the professions and pursuits of ordinary life, only in order to gather himself together again in God with greater purity and fewer disturbing elements, and renew in him the might of his own better powers" (Ewald, 'Antiquities of Israel,' p. 102). In the Sabbath institute, therefore, lies the basis of spiritual worship and pious service in Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In vv. 6-21, the ten covenant words are repeated from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>, with only a few variations, which have already been discussed in connection with the exposition of the decalogue at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-1.htm">Exodus 20:1-14</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-33</a>, Moses expounds still further the short account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>, viz., that after the people had heard the ten covenant words, in their alarm at the awful phenomena in which the Lord revealed His glory, they entreated him to stand between as mediator, that God Himself might not speak to them any further, and that they might not die, and then promised that they would hearken to all that the Lord should speak to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23</a> -31). His purpose in doing so was to link on the exhortation in vv. 32, 33, to keep all the commandments of the Lord and do them, which paves the way for passing to the exposition of the law which follows. "A great voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>) is an adverbial accusative, signifying "with a great voice" (cf. Ges. 118, 3). "And He added no more:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>. God spoken the ten words directly to the people, and then no more; i.e., everything further He addressed to Moses alone, and through his mediation to the people. As mediator He gave him the two tables of stone, upon which He had written the decalogue (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). This statement somewhat forestalls the historical course; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10-11</a>, it is repeated again in its proper historical connection. </body></html>
