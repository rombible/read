The children of Israel had now become, or were just about to become, landowners; hence the addition is appropriate in this place. There is also another slight verbal alteration. One word only is used for “covet” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>; here two are employed. The idea of the one is to “delight in,” and the other to “lust after.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-21.htm" title="Neither shall you desire your neighbor's wife, neither shall you covet your neighbor's house, his field, or his manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any thing that is your neighbor's.">Deuteronomy 5:21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Neither shalt thou covet any thing, that is thy neighbour’s — </span>The plain meaning of this is, Thou shalt not desire any thing that is not thy own, any thing which thou hast not. Indeed, why shouldest thou? God hath given thee whatever tends to thy one end, holiness. Thou canst not deny it, without making him a liar; and when any thing else will tend thereto, he will give thee that also. There is, therefore, no room to desire any thing which thou hast not. Thou hast already every thing that is really good for thee; wouldest thou have more money, more pleasure, more praise still? Why, this is not good for thee.

It is more necessary that we tie ourselves to the things, than to the words unalterably. The original reason for hallowing the sabbath, taken from God's resting from the work of creation on the seventh day, is not here mentioned. Though this ever remains in force, it is not the only reason. Here it is taken from Israel's deliverance out of Egypt; for that was typical of our redemption by Jesus Christ, in remembrance of which the Christian sabbath was to be observed. In the resurrection of Christ we were brought into the glorious liberty of the children of God, with a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm.

Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, &#8230; house, his field&#8212;An alteration is here made in the words (see Ex 20:17), but it is so slight ("wife" being put in the first clause and "house" in the second) that it would not have been worth while noticing it, except that the interchange proves, contrary to the opinion of some eminent critics, that these two objects are included in one and the same commandment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In <span class="bld"> Exo 20</span>, the order is contrary, and thy neighbour’s house is put before his wife, whereby it is evident that Moses intended this but for one commandment, wherein the order of the words was an inconsiderable circumstance; for if this were two commandments, as some would have it, it would be altogether uncertain which is the ninth, and which the tenth commandment, seeing the one is first, <span class="bld"> Exo 20</span>, and the other here. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife,.... Here a neighbour's wife is put before his house, different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm">Exodus 20:17</a> and "his field" is added, which with what follows take in everything that is a man's property; and which is not to be desired or coveted in an unlawful manner by another, and much less should any means be made use of to deprive him of it; but "lust" is the thing intended and prohibited, be it after what it may, which is another man's: see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm">Matthew 5:28</a>, of a man's field, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Neither shalt <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or any <i>thing</i> that <i>is</i> thy neighbour's.</span><p>(h) He not only speaks of that resolute will, but that there should be no motion or affection.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. The Tenth Commandment, carrying the Law from the sphere of action into that of thought and feeling, and therefore not superfluous even in so brief a summary of the Law nor after the Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Commandments (cp. Calvin, <span class="ital">in loco</span>). How necessary the Commandment is not merely as an addition to these Commandments, but as focussing the spirit of them all is clear from the experience of St Paul, who selects the Tenth Commandment to illustrate the power of the whole Law: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then? Is the law sin? God forbid. No, I had not known sin, but by the law: for I had not known lust, except the law had said, You shall not covet....">Romans 7:7-8</a>; Romans cf.14, <span class="ital">the law is spiritual</span>. The nature of this Commandment renders it peculiarly susceptible of expansion (as the Sixth to the Ninth are not); details naturally offer themselves under so general a precept; and here the deuteronomists had the opportunity which they loved to use, and were upon their own ground? cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm" title="The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>, where the desire for, as well as the actual appropriation of, unlawful silver and gold is forbidden. The two expanded editions of the Decalogue here exhibit the most interesting of the differences which distinguish them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>, preserving the original form of the Commandment, <span class="ital">Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house</span>, and repeating the verb, simply details, as upon the same level, the constituents of the house: wife, slaves, animals, all that is thy neighbour’s. But this later edition in Deut. makes among these a fundamental distinction of far-reaching moral consequence; takes <span class="ital">the wife</span> first in a class by herself, then—under another verb, as if to emphasise the difference—gives the rest together; and, with the peculiar regard which D has for the rural life, adds to them <span class="ital">the field</span> of thy neighbour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">covet</span>] the same Heb. verb as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-17.htm" title="You shall not covet your neighbor's house, you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that is your neighbor's.">Exodus 20:17</a>. The rendering of the revisers is not a happy one, because though the English <span class="ital">covet</span> originally meant inordinate desire, it is now generally used with other objects than wife. The A.V. <span class="ital">desire</span> literally renders the Heb. verb, the meaning of which is neutral and has to be qualified by its object. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-24.htm" title="For I will cast out the nations before you, and enlarge your borders: neither shall any man desire your land, when you shall go up to appear before the LORD your God thrice in the year.">Exodus 34:24</a> of dishonest desire for land; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm" title="The graven images of their gods shall you burn with fire: you shall not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it to you, lest you be snared therein: for it is an abomination to the LORD your God.">Deuteronomy 7:25</a> for silver and gold (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>, JE); <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm" title="And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses, and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even a man and his heritage.">Micah 2:2</a> (cp. Ahab and Naboth’s vineyard) for fields and houses. But in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-25.htm" title="Lust not after her beauty in your heart; neither let her take you with her eyelids.">Proverbs 6:25</a> it signifies lust after the beauty of women. So it should be rendered here, and so some of the older Eng. Versions render it. Similarly the <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμεῖν</span> of the LXX, always so in Greek when a person is the object; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Matthew 5:28</a>. Kautzsch: ‘verlangen tragen,’ and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-21.htm" title="When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and, behold, they are hid in the earth in the middle of my tent, and the silver under it.">Joshua 7:21</a>, ‘da gelüstete mich nach.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy neighbour’s wife</span>] The way in which (in contrast to Ex.) the wife is placed here first, in a class by herself, may be compared with other laws of D which also seek the elevation of woman, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/21-10.htm" title="When you go forth to war against your enemies, and the LORD your God has delivered them into your hands, and you have taken them captive,...">Deuteronomy 21:10-14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-13.htm" title="And you shall have a paddle on your weapon; and it shall be, when you will ease yourself abroad, you shall dig therewith, and shall turn back and cover that which comes from you:">Deuteronomy 23:13</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">desire</span>] Instead of the repetition in Ex. of the original verb, another verb is employed here of stronger meaning but apparently intended as only ‘a rhetorical variation’ (Driver) rather than as a climax.

His purpose in doing so was to link on the exhortation in vv. 32, 33, to keep all the commandments of the Lord and do them, which paves the way for passing to the exposition of the law which follows. "A great voice" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-22.htm">Exodus 20:22</a>) is an adverbial accusative, signifying "with a great voice" (cf. Ges. 118, 3). "And He added no more:" as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-25.htm">Numbers 11:25</a>. God spoken the ten words directly to the people, and then no more; i.e., everything further He addressed to Moses alone, and through his mediation to the people. As mediator He gave him the two tables of stone, upon which He had written the decalogue (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm">Exodus 31:18</a>). This statement somewhat forestalls the historical course; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10-11</a>, it is repeated again in its proper historical connection. </body></html>
