God's appearances have always been terrible to man, ever since the fall; but Christ, having taken away sin, invites us to come boldly to the throne of grace. They were in a good mind, under the strong convictions of the word they heard. Many have their consciences startled by the law who have them not purified; fair promises are extorted from them, but no good principles are fixed and rooted in them. God commended what they said. He desires the welfare and salvation of poor sinners. He has given abundant proof that he does so; he gives us time and space to repent. He has sent his Son to redeem us, promised his Spirit to those who pray for him, and has declared that he has no pleasure in the ruin of sinners. It would be well with many, if there were always such a heart in them, as there seems to be sometimes; when they are under conviction of sin, or the rebukes of providence, or when they come to look death in the face. The only way to be happy, is to be holy. Say to the righteous, It shall be well with them. Let believers make it more and more their study and delight, to do as the Lord God hath commanded.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses contain a much fuller narrative of the events briefly described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-21</a>. Here it is important to call attention to the fact that it was on the entreaties of the people that Moses had taken on him to be the channel of communication between God and them. God approved <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-28.htm">Deuteronomy 5:28</a> the request of the people, because it showed a feeling of their own unworthiness to enter into direct communion with God. The terrors of Sinai had done their work; they had awakened the consciousness of sin. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Oh, that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me&#8212;God can bestow such a heart, and has promised to give it, wherever it is asked (Jer 32:40). But the wish which is here expressed on the part of God for the piety and steadfast obedience of the Israelites did not relate to them as individuals, so much as a nation, whose religious character and progress would have a mighty influence on the world at large.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Neither by superstitious additions to God’s commands, nor by a bold or profane rejection or contempt of any one of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye shall observe to do therefore as the Lord your God doth command you,....

The phrase is expressive of a strict and close attention to the word of God, without deviating from it in the least; for every sin, which is a transgression of some command of God or another, is a going out of the way that directs unto; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-21.htm">Isaiah 30:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath commanded you: ye shall not <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</span><p>(l) You shall neither add nor take away, De 4:2.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32, 33</span>.
