Josephus considers this as a prohibition, not only against removing any land-mark of an Israelite, but also any that might distinguish their territories from those of any of the neighbouring nations, with whom they might be at peace, the breaking in upon these bounds being generally the occasion of wars and insurrections, which arise from the covetousness of men, who would thus fraudulently enlarge their possessions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:14 Direction is given to fix landmarks in Canaan.

Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of old have set in thine inheritance&#8212;The state of Palestine in regard to enclosures is very much the same now as it has always been. Though gardens and vineyards are surrounded by dry-stone walls or hedges of prickly pear, the boundaries of arable fields are marked by nothing but by a little trench, a small cairn, or a single erect stone, placed at certain intervals. It is manifest that a dishonest person could easily fill the gutter with earth, or remove these stones a few feet without much risk of detection and so enlarge his own field by a stealthy encroachment on his neighbor's.

Against Removing Boundary Stones<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Sg. address, but as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm" title="And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;">Deuteronomy 19:4</a></span> f., 11 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm" title="And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that lends ought to his neighbor shall release it; he shall not exact it of his neighbor, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD's release.">Deuteronomy 15:2</a>, <span class="ital">q.v.</span>, with <span class="ital">neighbour</span> instead of <span class="ital">brother</span>, usual in Sg. passages; and followed by a deuteronomic formula. It is significant that the formula is not only separable from the law proper (as in the previous law) but contradicts it. For while the law betrays its date as subsequent to Israel’s settlement in the land—and with this agree the facts that there is no parallel in the earlier codes and that protests against removing boundary-stones appear in the prophets and later books (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm" title="Woe to them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone in the middle of the earth!">Isaiah 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm" title="The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound: therefore I will pour out my wrath on them like water.">Hosea 5:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm" title="Remove not the ancient landmark, which your fathers have set.">Proverbs 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm" title="Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of the fatherless:">Proverbs 23:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm" title="Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks, and feed thereof.">Job 24:2</a>)—the closing formula adopts the standpoint of Moses, <span class="ital">the land which the Lord is to give thee</span>. Clearly, therefore, the law has been adopted from some other source into D’s Code—cp. the Decalogue—but there is nothing to show whether this incorporation was due to the authors of the Code or to editors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is difficult to explain the position of the law just here. Steuern. and Berth, attribute this to its use of the term <span class="ital">gebul, boundary</span>, used also in the previous law (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm" title="You shall prepare you a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.">Deuteronomy 19:3</a> a</span>, yet with a different meaning from here); the former thinking that in its original form the law was entered on the margin and thence taken into the text by the compiler of the Code, the latter that it may have formed part of the original Code. Notice rather that both laws besides being in the Sg. address use the term <span class="ital">neighbour</span>, and were therefore probably from the same source. Dillm. points out that in this ch. murder, theft and false-witness appear in the same order as in the Decalogue, and Dri. compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:17</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Other nations expressed the same reverence for the sacredness of boundaries, in similar laws, or protests, against their removal. For the Greeks see Plato, <span class="ital">Legg</span>. viii. 842 e, for the Romans Dion. Hal. ii. 74, Plutarch, <span class="ital">Numa</span> 16. For the settled Semites cp. the border-stones of fields which are among the oldest Babyl. monuments; bearing dedications to the gods ‘they were regarded as sacred and great importance was attached to their preservation. The Kings taxed their powers of cursing [cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-17.htm" title="Cursed be he that removes his neighbor's landmark. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:17</a>] in order to terrify men from removing their neighbours’ landmarks’ (Johns, <span class="ital">Babyl. and Assyr. Laws</span>, etc., 191 f.). For other Semites cp. Clay Trumbull, <span class="ital">Threshold Covenant</span> 166, Musil, <span class="ital">Ethn. Ber.</span> 87, Doughty i. 163. No such Israelite stones have been found, but M. Clermont-Ganneau discovered the boundary inscriptions of the town of Gezer (‘at or near the 1st Cent. b.c.’) bearing the term <span class="ital">teḥum</span>, the later Heb. for <span class="ital">gebul</span> (<span class="ital">Arch.

if these had been placed by a man's ancestors to mark the boundaries of possessions, they were not to be surreptitiously altered. Landmarks were held sacred, and a curse is pronounced against those who remove them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-2.htm">Job 24:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/22-28.htm">Proverbs 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-10.htm">Proverbs 23:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-10.htm">Hosea 5:10</a>). Among other nations also landmarks were regarded as sacred (cf. Plato, 'De Legibus,' 8. p. 842; Dionys. Halic. 2:17; Plutarch, 'Numa,' 16; Ovid, 'Fast.,' 2:639). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They of old time</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. those of a former age (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b4;&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b9;&#x5e0;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, earlier ones, ancestors, predecessors).

That the law here given was uttered whilst Israel was yet outside of Canaan, is evident from what follows in this verse. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Moses had already set apart the cities of refuge for the land on the east of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-41.htm">Deuteronomy 4:41</a>.), he is speaking here simply of the land on the west, which Israel was to take possession of before long; and supplements the instructions in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-14.htm">Numbers 35:14</a>, with directions to maintain the roads to the cities of refuge which were to be set apart in Canaan itself, and to divide the land into three parts, viz., for the purpose of setting apart these cities, so that one city might be chosen for the purpose in every third of the land. For further remarks on this point, as well as with regard to the use of these cities (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm">Deuteronomy 19:4-7</a>), see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-11.htm">Numbers 35:11</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-8.htm">Deuteronomy 19:8-10</a> there follow the fresh instructions, that if the Lord should extend the borders of Israel, according to His promise given to the patriarchs, and should give them the whole land from the Nile to the Euphrates, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, they were to add three other cities of refuge to these three, for the purpose of preventing the shedding of innocent blood. The three new cities of refuge cannot be the three appointed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-14.htm">Numbers 35:14</a> for the land on this side of the Jordan, nor the three mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-7.htm">Numbers 35:7</a> on the other side of Jordan, as Knobel and others suppose. Nor can we adopt Hengstenberg's view, that the three new ones are the same as the three mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-2.htm">Deuteronomy 19:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-7.htm">Deuteronomy 19:7</a>, since they are expressly distinguished from "these three." The meaning is altogether a different one. The circumstances supposed by Moses never existed, since the Israelites did not fulfil the conditions laid down in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-9.htm">Deuteronomy 19:9</a>, viz., that they should keep the law faithfully, and love the Lord their God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-6.htm">Deuteronomy 4:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>, etc.). The extension of the power of Israel to the Euphrates under David and Solomon, did not bring the land as far as this river into their actual possession, since the conquered kingdoms of Aram were still inhabited by the Aramaeans, who, though conquered, were only rendered tributary. And the Tyrians and Phoenicians, who belonged to the Canaanitish population, were not even attacked by David.</body></html>
