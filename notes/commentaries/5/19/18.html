A false witness should suffer the same punishment which he sought to have inflicted upon the person he accused. Nor could any law be more just. Let all Christians not only be cautious in bearing witness in public, but be careful not to join in private slanders; and let all whose consciences accuse them of crime, without delay flee for refuge to the hope set before them in Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Both the men, between whom the controversy is - Not the accused and the false witness, but the plaintiff and defendant (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-1.htm">Exodus 23:1</a>) who were summoned before the supreme court held, as provided in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17.htm">Deuteronomy 17</a>, at the sanctuary.

If such murderers should flee to the free city, the elders (magistrates) of his own town were to fetch him out, and deliver him up to the avenger of blood, that he might die. The law laid down in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-16.htm">Numbers 35:16-21</a> is here still more minutely defined; but this does not transfer to the elders the duty of instituting a judicial inquiry, and deciding the matter, as Riehm follows Vater and De Wette in maintaining, for the purpose of proving that there is a discrepancy between Deuteronomy and the previous legislation. They are simply commanded to perform the duty devolving upon them as magistrates and administrators of local affairs.
