In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins, shall be safe in him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by him in their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With the axe - literally, "with the iron."

Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his heart is hot&#8212;This verse is a continuation of De 19:3 (for De 19:4, 5, which are explanatory, are in a parenthetical form), and the meaning is that if the kinsman of a person inadvertently killed should, under the impulse of sudden excitement and without inquiring into the circumstances, inflict summary vengeance on the homicide, however guiltless, the law tolerated such an act; it was to pass with impunity. But to prevent such precipitate measures, the cities of refuge were established for the reception of the homicide, that "innocent blood might not be shed in thy land" (De 19:10). In the case of premeditated murder (De 19:11, 12), they afforded no immunity; but, if it were only manslaughter, the moment the fugitive was within the gates, he found himself in a safe asylum (Nu 35:26-28; Jos 20:6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse is to be joined with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-3.htm" title="You shall prepare you a way, and divide the coasts of your land, which the LORD your God gives you to inherit, into three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.">Deu 19:3</a></span>, as is evident, the 4th and 5th verses coming in as a parenthesis, which is usual in Scripture and other authors. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And slay him; </span> which is supposed, but not allowed, as appears from the following words.
