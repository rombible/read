In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their trespasses.

No hillock was left, no river over which there was not a bridge; and the road was at least 32 cubits broad. At cross-roads there were posts bearing the words Refuge, Refuge, to guide the fugitive in his flight.

A road, an highway to those cities: on the first of Adar, or February, the magistrates used to meet, and proclaimed, or ordered to be proclaimed, that the ways be repaired (r), particularly those leading to the cities of refuge; which was done by making them smooth and plain, so that there was not an hill or dale to be seen; and by building bridges over rivers and brooks, that he might escape who had killed anyone through mistake, and not be hindered, lest the avenger of blood should overtake him and kill him (s); and therefore every obstruction was removed out of the way, that there might be a clear course for him; and at the parting of ways, or where two or more ways met, that he might not be at a loss one moment which way to take, "refuge" was written, as Jarchi and other writers observe, upon posts or pillars erected for that purpose: See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-6.htm">Numbers 35:6</a>, <p>and divide the coasts of thy land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee to inherit, in three parts; in each of which was to be a city of refuge, and those at an equal distance: so Jarchi observes, that this was done that there might be from the beginning of the border (of the land) unto the first city of the cities of refuge, according to the measure of a journey, that there is from that to the second, and so from the second to the third, and so from the third to the other border of the land of Israel: of the situation of these cities, so as to answer to those on the other side Jordan; see Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-14.htm">Numbers 35:14</a>, <p>that every slayer may flee thither; to that which is nearest and most convenient for him, that is, who had slain a man unawares, as follows. <p>(r) Misn.

That roads, however, properly so called, were not unknown to the Hebrews, even in early times, is evident, not only from this passage, but also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-22.htm">Leviticus 26:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-17.htm">Numbers 20:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-22.htm">Numbers 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-27.htm">Deuteronomy 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-12.htm">1 Samuel 6:12</a>. The design of the injunction here was that every facility should be afforded to the fugitive to escape to the place of refuge. In later times, it was enacted that the roads leading to these cities should be repaired every year in the month Adar, and every obstruction removed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With this assurance the Lord had fully granted the request of the people, "according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God;" and Israel, therefore, was all the more bound to hearken to the prophets, whom God would raise up from the midst of itself, and not to resort to heathen soothsayers. (On the fact itself, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-20.htm">Deuteronomy 5:20</a>. with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15-17</a>.)

Whoever did not hearken to the words of the prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord, of him the Lord would require it, i.e., visit the disobedience with punishment (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-13.htm">Psalm 10:13</a>). On the other hand, the prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord what the Lord had not commanded him, i.e., proclaimed the thoughts of his own heart as divine revelations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-28.htm">Numbers 16:28</a>), should die, like the prophet who spoke in the name of other gods.
