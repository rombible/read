In Christ, the Lord our Righteousness, refuge is provided for those who by faith flee unto him. But there is no refuge in Jesus Christ for presumptuous sinners, who go on still in their trespasses. Those who flee to Christ from their sins, shall be safe in him, but not those who expect to be sheltered by him in their sins.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt prepare thee a way - It was the duty of the Senate to repair the roads that led to the cities of refuge annually, and remove every obstruction. No hillock was left, no river over which there was not a bridge; and the road was at least 32 cubits broad. At cross-roads there were posts bearing the words Refuge, Refuge, to guide the fugitive in his flight. It seems as if in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> ff the imagery were borrowed from the preparation of the ways to the cities of refuge.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

(On the fact itself, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-20.htm">Deuteronomy 5:20</a>. with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15-17</a>.)

Whoever did not hearken to the words of the prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord, of him the Lord would require it, i.e., visit the disobedience with punishment (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/10-4.htm">Psalm 10:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/10-13.htm">Psalm 10:13</a>). On the other hand, the prophet who spoke in the name of the Lord what the Lord had not commanded him, i.e., proclaimed the thoughts of his own heart as divine revelations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-28.htm">Numbers 16:28</a>), should die, like the prophet who spoke in the name of other gods.
