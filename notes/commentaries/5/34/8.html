It is a debt owing to the surviving honour of deceased worthies, to follow them with our tears, as those who loved and valued them, are sensible of the loss of them, and humbled for the sins which have provoked God to deprive us of them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:5-8 Moses obeyed this command of God as willingly as any other, though it seemed harder. In this he resembled our Lord Jesus Christ. But he died in honour, in peace, and in the most easy manner; the Saviour died upon the disgraceful and torturing cross. Moses died very easily; he died at the mouth of the Lord, according to the will of God. The servants of the Lord, when they have done all their other work, must die at last, and be willing to go home, whenever their Master sends for them, Ac 21:13. The place of his burial was not known. If the soul be at rest with God, it is of little consequence where the body rests. There was no decay in the strength of his body, nor in the vigour and activity of his mind; his understanding was as clear, and his memory as strong as ever. This was the reward of his services, the effect of his extraordinary meekness. There was solemn mourning for him. Yet how great soever our losses have been, we must not give ourselves up to sorrow. If we hope to go to heaven rejoicing, why should we go to the grave mourning?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>No man knoweth of his sepulchre - Hardly, lest the grave of Moses should become an object of superstitious honor, because the Jews were not prone to this particular fore of error. Bearing in mind the appearance of Moses at the Transfiguration <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/17-1.htm">Matthew 17:1-10</a>, and what is said by Jude Jde 1:9, we may conjecture that Moses after death passed into the same state with Enoch and Elijah; and that his grave could not be found because he was shortly translated (transported) from it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. wept for Moses &#8230; thirty days&#8212;Seven days was the usual period of mourning, but for persons in high rank or official eminence, it was extended to thirty (Ge 50:3-10; Nu 20:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/34.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thirty days</span> was the usual time of mourning for persons of high place and eminency.

And the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan, After blessing the people, Moses ascended Mount Nebo, according to the command of God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-48.htm">Deuteronomy 32:48-51</a>), and there the Lord showed him, in all its length and breadth, that promised land into which he was not to enter. From Nebo, a peak of Pisgah, which affords a very extensive prospect on all sides, he saw the land of Gilead, the land to the east of the Jordan as far as Dan, i.e., not Laish-Dan near the central source of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-27.htm">Judges 18:27</a>), which did not belong to Gilead, but a Dan in northern Peraea, which has not yet been discovered (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-14.htm">Genesis 14:14</a>); and the whole of the land on the west of the Jordan, Canaan proper, in all its different districts, namely, "the whole of Naphtali," i.e., the later Galilee on the north, "the land of Ephraim and Manasseh" in the centre, and "the whole of the land of Judah," the southern portion of Canaan, in all its breadth, "to the hinder (Mediterranean) sea" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>); also "the south land" (Negeb: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>), the southern land of steppe towards the Arabian desert, and "the valley of the Jordan" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>), i.e., the deep valley from Jericho the palm-city (so called from the palms which grew there, in the valley of the Jordan: <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-16.htm">Judges 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-15.htm">2 Chronicles 28:15</a>) "to Zoar" at the southern extremity of the Dead Sea (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-22.htm">Genesis 19:22</a>). This sight of every part of the land on the east and west was not an ecstatic vision, but a sight with the bodily eyes, whose natural power of vision was miraculously increased by God, to give Moses a glimpse at least of the glorious land which he was not to tread, and delight his eye with a view of the inheritance intended for his people. </body></html>
