The moral of these words has been well pointed out by Jewish writers. It was but eleven days’ journey from Sinai to Kadesh-barnea—the place from whence Israel should have begun the conquest of the promised land; but not only eleven days of the second year of the exodus, but eleven months of the fortieth year found them still in the wilderness. “We see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.”<p>(3, 4) <span class= "bld">Moses spake unto the children of Israel . . . after he had slain Sihon . . . and Og.</span>—The conquest of these two kings and their territories was one of the exploits of the fortieth year. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-21.htm" title="And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,">Numbers 21:21-35</a>.) Before the eleventh month of that year, not only Sihon and Og, but also the five princes of Midian, “who were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-21.htm" title="And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the country.">Joshua 13:21</a>), had also been slain (Numbers 31). This completed the conquest, and was the last exploit of Moses’ life. In the period of repose that followed he found a suitable time to exhort the children of Israel, “according unto all that the Lord had given him in commandment unto them” From <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-8.htm" title="And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.">Deuteronomy 34:8</a>, we learn that “the children of Israel wept for Moses thirty days.” These days would seem to be the last month of the fortieth year, for “on the tenth day of the first month” (probably of the next year, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-19.htm" title="And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of Jericho.">Joshua 4:19</a>) they passed over Jordan. Thus the <span class= "ital">last delivery </span>of the discourses recorded in Deuteronomy would seem to lie within a single month.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/1-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them;...">Deuteronomy 1:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">The eleventh month — </span>Which was but a little before his death. <span class="ital">All that the Lord had given him in command — </span>Which shows not only that what he now delivered was in substance the same with what had formerly been commanded, but that God now commanded him to repeat it.

This was to remind them that their own bad conduct had occasioned their tedious wanderings; that they might the more readily understand the advantages of obedience. They must now go forward. Though God brings his people into trouble and affliction, he knows when they have been tried long enough.

The Babyl. system was first adopted by the Jews, not during the exile (as usually supposed, Marti, <span class="ital">Enc.

It was also after the destruction of Sihon and 'Og (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). This also is significant. By the destruction of these kings, who sought to bar the access of the Israelites to the Promised Land, God had given proof that he would indeed fulfill his promise to his people, and had at once laid them under obligations to obedience, and given them encouragement to go forward on the course to which he had called them. The "he" here is Moses, who, at the command of God, had led the Israelites against Sihon and 'Og. Edrei, <span class="accented">hod</span> Draa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>) was the second capital of 'Og; he "reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>). Here, however, it denotes the place where he was slain in battle, and the words "in Edrei" are to be referred to the verb "smote" and not to "dwelt" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/numbers/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/36-10.htm">Numbers 36:10-12</a> it is related that, in accordance with these instructions, the five daughters of Zelophehad, whose names are repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-33.htm">Numbers 26:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-1.htm">Numbers 27:1</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-3.htm">Joshua 17:3</a>), married husbands from the families of the Manassites, namely, sons of their cousins (? uncles), and thus their inheritance remained in their father's tribe (&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, to be and remain upon anything). </body></html>
