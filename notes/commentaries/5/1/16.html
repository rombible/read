He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope?

This important arrangement for the good government of the people took place before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with themselves! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude&#8212;This was neither an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast.

The "swearing" on the part of God points back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-16.htm">Genesis 22:16</a>. The expression "to them and to their seed" is the same as "to thee and to thy seed" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-15.htm">Genesis 13:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-8.htm">Genesis 17:8</a>, and is not to be understood as signifying that the patriarchs themselves ought to have taken actual possession of Canaan; but "to their seed" is in apposition, and also a more precise definition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-7.htm">Genesis 15:7</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>, where the simple statement "to thee" is explained by the fuller statement "to thy seed"). &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; has grown into an interjection  equals  &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;. &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;: to give before a person, equivalent to give up to a person, or place at his free disposal (for the use of the word in this sense, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-9.htm">Genesis 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-10.htm">Genesis 34:10</a>). Jehovah (this is the idea of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6-8</a>), when He concluded the covenant with the Israelites at Horeb, had intended to fulfil at once the promise which He gave to the patriarchs, and to put them into possession of the promised land; and Moses had also done what was required on his part, as he explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9-18</a>, to bring the people safety to Canaan (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-23.htm">Exodus 18:23</a>). As the nation had multiplied as the stars of heaven, in accordance with the promise of the Lord, and he felt unable to bear the burden alone and settle all disputes, he had placed over them at that time wise and intelligent men from the heads of the tribes to act as judges, and had instructed them to adjudicate upon the smaller matters of dispute righteously and without respect of person. For further particulars concerning the appointment of the judges, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13-26</a>, where it is related how Moses adopted this plan at the advice of Jethro, even before the giving of the law at Sinai. The expression "at that time," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm">Deuteronomy 1:9</a>, is not at variance with this. The imperfect &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; with vav rel., expresses the order of thought and not of time. For Moses did not intend to recall the different circumstances to the recollection of the people in their chronological order, but arranged them according to their relative importance in connection with the main object of his address. And this required that he should begin with what God had done for the fulfilment of His promise, and then proceed afterwards to notice what he, the servant of God, had done in his office, as an altogether subordinate matter. So far as this object was concerned, it was also perfectly indifferent who had advised him to adopt this plan, whilst it was very important to allude to the fact that it was the great increase in the number of the Israelites which had rendered it necessary, that he might remind the congregation how the Lord, even at that time, had fulfilled the promise which He gave to the patriarchs, and in that fulfilment had given a practical guarantee of the certain fulfilment of the other promises as well. Moses accomplished this by describing the increase of the nation in such a way that his hearers should be involuntarily reminded of the covenant promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-18.htm">Genesis 18:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-17.htm">Genesis 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-4.htm">Genesis 26:4</a>).</body></html>
