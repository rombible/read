He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That great and terrible wilderness - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>.

It is called by the Arabs El Tih, "the wandering." It is a dreary waste of rock and of calcareous soil covered with black sharp flints; all travellers, from a feeling of its complete isolation from the world, describe it as a great and terrible wilderness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I said unto you, you are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,....

They were to go up by the Negeb, still intervening between them and the Mt of the Amorite, to see the land, its dwellers, their manner of life, and the fruits. Thus they came to Ḥebron where were sons of ‘Anaḳ and brought back from the vale of ’Eshḳol some fruit to Ḳadesh, reporting the land to be good, but the people strong and their cities fenced and great. It is clear that the deuteronomic review is a summary of this account.
