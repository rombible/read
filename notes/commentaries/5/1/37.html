As the spies presumed to investigate the route and order of the conquest, a matter of Divine guidance, so Moses presumed to alter the prescribed order for the miracle in Kadesh.

He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sentence on Moses was not passed when the people rebelled during their first encampment at Kadesh, but some 37 years later, when they had re-assembled in the same neighborhood at Meribah (see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-13.htm">Numbers 20:13</a> note).

But Kaleb is mentioned in JE on which this survey otherwise depends. In whatever way these textual questions may be decided, the parallel passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-26.htm" title="But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear me: and the LORD said to me, Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.">Deuteronomy 3:26</a> ff. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-21.htm" title="Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which the LORD your God gives you for an inheritance:">Deuteronomy 4:21</a> confirm the fact of a D tradition or statement that Jehovah was angry with Moses for the people’s sake. This can only mean, their guilt was great enough to include the very leader who had done his best to dissuade them from their disaffection! Now neither JE nor P gives any hint of so remarkable a judgement. On the contrary, P accounts for the exclusion of Moses by his own sin in striking the rock at Ḳadesh 37 years after this disaffection of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm" title="And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.">Numbers 21:10</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/27-13.htm" title="And when you have seen it, you also shall be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother was gathered.">Numbers 27:13</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-50.htm" title="And die in the mount where you go up, and be gathered to your people; as Aaron your brother died in mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:">Deuteronomy 32:50</a> f. The most reasonable explanation of such discrepancies is that they are discrepancies not of fact but or opinion. The earliest tradition, JE, merely held the facts that Kaleb survived and that Moses died on the eve of the possession of the Promised Land. The problem, which arose from this contrast of fortune, the deuteronomic writers solved by the statement that Moses was included in the guilt of the people when, startled by the report of the spies, they refused to invade Canaan from the S. in the second year of the wandering; and this agrees with the deuteronomic principle of the ethical solidarity of Israel. But the later priestly writer or writers, under the influence of the idea, first emphasized in the time of Jeremiah and Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-29.htm" title="In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge.">Jeremiah 31:29</a> f., Ezekiel 18), that every man died because of his own sin, found a solution for the problem in Moses’ own guilt in presumptuously striking the rock at Ḳadesh, 37 years later. In this double engagement, from two different standpoints, with so difficult a problem, note the strong evidence that the survival of Kaleb and the death of Moses before Israel’s entrance to the Land were regarded as irremoveable elements of the early tradition.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 37.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Lord was angry with me also for your sakes, saying, Thou also shalt not go in thither.</span> This must be regarded as parenthetical, for what he here refers to in regard to himself occurred, not at the time of the rebellion at Kadesh, but at the time of the second arrival of the people at that place, many years later. This parenthetical reference to himself was probably thrown in by Moses for the purpose of preparing for what he was about to say respecting Joshua, in whom the people were to find a leader after he himself was gone. It may be noted also that Moses distinguishes between the anger of the Lord against him, and the wrath which broke forth upon the people - a distinction which is aptly preserved in the Authorized Version by the words "was wroth" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e7;&#x5b8;&#x5e6;&#x5e4;</span>) and "was angry" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b8;&#x5e0;&#x5b7;&#x5e4;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your sakes</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because of you</span>, <span class="accented">on accent of</span> you. The Hebrew word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;</span>) comes from a root meaning to roll, and signifies primarily a turn in events, a circumstance, an occasion or reason. Moses reminds the Israelites that the misconduct of the people was what led to God's being angry also with him (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-7.htm">Numbers 20:7</a>, etc.; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-32.htm">Psalm 106:32, 33</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The attempt made by Moses to inspire the despondent people with courage, when they were ready to despair of ever conquering the Canaanites, by pointing them to the help of the Lord, which they had experienced in so mighty and visible a manner in Egypt and the desert, and to urge them to renewed confidence in this their almighty Helper and Guide, was altogether without success. And just because the appeal of Moses was unsuccessful, it is passed over in the historical account in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13</a>; all that is mentioned there (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm">Deuteronomy 1:6-9</a>) being the effort made by Joshua and Caleb to stir up the people, and that on account of the effects which followed the courageous bearing of these two men, so far as their own future history was concerned. The words "goeth before you," in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>, are resumed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-33.htm">Deuteronomy 1:33</a>, and carried out still further. "Jehovah,...He shall fight for you according to all (&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;) that," i.e., in exactly the same manner, as, "He did for you in Egypt," especially at the crossing of the Red Sea (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>), "and in the wilderness, which thou hast seen (&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-19.htm">Deuteronomy 1:19</a>), where (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; without &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; in a loose connection; see Ewald, 331, c. and 333, a.) Jehovah thy God bore thee as a man beareth his son;" i.e., supported, tended, and provided for thee in the most fatherly way (see the similar figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-12.htm">Numbers 11:12</a>, and expanded still more fully in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-1.htm">Psalm 23:1-6</a>).</body></html>
