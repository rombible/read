He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That great and terrible wilderness - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-15.htm">Deuteronomy 8:15</a>. This language is such as people would employ after having passed with toil and suffering through the worst part of it, the southern half of the Arabah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a> note); and more especially when they had but recently rested from their marches in the plain of Shittim, the largest and richest oasis in the whole district on the Eastern bank near the mouth of the Jordan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-21. we went through all that great and terrible wilderness&#8212;of Paran, which included the desert and mountainous space lying between the wilderness of Shur westward, or towards Egypt and mount Seir, or the land of Edom eastwards; between the land of Canaan northwards, and the Red Sea southwards; and thus it appears to have comprehended really the wilderness of Sin and Sinai [Fisk]. It is called by the Arabs El Tih, "the wandering." It is a dreary waste of rock and of calcareous soil covered with black sharp flints; all travellers, from a feeling of its complete isolation from the world, describe it as a great and terrible wilderness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee,....

The LXX has indeed the Pl. but apparently in order to harmonise with the context; the Sg. is confirmed by the Sam. Moreover the expression <span class="ital">fear thou not neither be dismayed</span> (al-tîra’ We’al teḥath) is always found with the Sg. address, while the Pl. has for the same idea <span class="ital">dread ye not neither fear ye</span> (lo-ta‘arsûn welô-tîrûn), e.g. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-29.htm" title="Then I said to you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.">Deuteronomy 1:29</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-6.htm" title="Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the LORD your God, he it is that does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you.">Deuteronomy 31:6</a>.

It is probable, therefore, that the verse is a later insertion, to make that connection clearer and more exact.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; &#1492;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, give here, provide for yourselves.
