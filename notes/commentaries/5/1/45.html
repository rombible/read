He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amorites - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>, it is "the Amalekites and the Canaanites" who are said to have discomfited them.

People often experience distress even while in the way of duty. But how different their condition who suffer in situations where God is with them from the feelings of those who are conscious that they are in a position directly opposed to the divine will! The Israelites were grieved when they found themselves involved in difficulties and perils; but their sorrow arose not from a sense of the guilt so much as the sad effects of their perverse conduct; and "though they wept," they were not true penitents.

Those that remained when the Amorites left pursuing them, returned to the camp at Kadesh, where Moses and the Levites were, and the rest of the people; and here they wept at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and hence said to be "before the Lord"; they wept because of the slaughter that had been made among them, and because of their sin in going contrary to the will of God, and because they were ordered into the wilderness; and very probably they cried and prayed unto the Lord, that they might not be turned back, but that he would go with them, and bring them now into the promised land: <p>but the Lord would not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you; was inexorable, and would not repeal the order to go into the wilderness again, where he had sworn in his wrath their carcasses should fall; the sentence was irrevocable. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not <span class="cverse3">{z}</span> hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.</span><p>(z) Because you rather showed your hypocrisy, than true repentance; rather lamenting the loss of your brethren, than repenting for your sins.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45</span>. <span class="ital">nor gave ear</span>] A poetic word used in the Hex. in prose only here and in the deuteronomic passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-26.htm" title="And said, If you will diligently listen to the voice of the LORD your God, and will do that which is right in his sight, and will give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, I will put none of these diseases on you, which I have brought on the Egyptians: for I am the LORD that heals you.">Exodus 15:26</a> (see Driver).

"Strengthen him:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; and with regard to the installation of Joshua as the leader of Israel, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-19</a>. The suffix in &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points back to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>. Joshua would divide the land among the Israelites for an inheritance, viz., (v. 39) among the young Israelites, the children of the condemned generation, whom Moses, when making a further communication of the judicial sentence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), had described as having no share in the sins of their parents, by adding, "who know not to-day what is good and evil." This expression is used to denote a condition of spiritual infancy and moral responsibility (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15-16</a>). It is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40-45</a> he proceeds to describe still further, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, how the people, by resisting the command of God to go back into the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>), had simply brought still greater calamities upon themselves, and had had to atone for the presumptuous attempt to force a way into Canaan, in opposition to the express will of the Lord, by enduring a miserable defeat. Instead of "they acted presumptuously to go up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), Moses says here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, "ye acted frivolously to go up;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>, "ye acted rashly, and went up." &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to boil, or boil over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>), signifies to act thoughtlessly, haughtily, or rashly.
