It can hardly be a record of what was spoken long before. It brings the living speaker before us in a way that precludes imitation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:9-18 Moses reminds the people of the happy constitution of their government, which might make them all safe and easy, if it was not their own fault. He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope? Good laws were given to the Israelites, and good men were to see to the execution of them, which showed God's goodness to them, and the care of Moses.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This appointment of the "captains" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21</a> ff) must not be confounded with that of the elders in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm">Numbers 11:16</a> ff. The former would number 78,600; the latter were 70 only.<p>A comparison between this passage and that in Exodus makes it obvious that Moses is only touching on certain parts of the whole history, without regard to order of time, but with a special purpose. This important arrangement for the good government of the people took place before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with themselves! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. ye are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude&#8212;This was neither an Oriental hyperbole nor a mere empty boast. Abraham was told (Ge 15:5, 6) to look to the stars, and though they "appear" innumerable, yet those seen by the naked eye amount, in reality, to no more than three thousand ten in both hemispheres. The Israelites already far exceeded that number, being at the last census above six hundred thousand [Nu 26:51]. It was a seasonable memento, calculated to animate their faith in the accomplishment of other parts of the divine promise.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Lord God of your fathers make you a thousand times so many more as ye are,....

But he felt his own inability, as leader, ruler, and judge, alone to cope with so vast a multitude. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the description of the ground to which the following addresses refer, there is appended an allusion to the not less significant time when Moses delivered them, viz., "on the first of the eleventh month in the fortieth year," consequently towards the end of his life, after the conclusion of the divine lawgiving; so that he was able to speak "according to all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them" (the Israelites), namely, in the legislation of the former books, which is always referred to in this way (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>). The time was also significant, from the fact that Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, had then been slain. By giving a victory over these mighty kings, the Lord had begun to fulfil His promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>), and had thereby laid Israel under the obligation to love, gratitude, and obedience (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). The suffix in &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Moses, who had smitten the Amorites at the command and by the power of Jehovah. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>; Edrei was the second capital of Og, and it is as such that it is mentioned, and not as the place where Og was defeated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>). The omission of the copula &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497; is to be accounted for from the oratorical character of the introduction to the addresses which follow. Edrei is the present Dra (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>, the description of the locality is again resumed in the words "beyond the Jordan," and still further defined by the expression "in the land of Moab;" and the address itself is introduced by the clause, "Moses took in hand to expound this law," which explains more fully the &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (spake) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>. "In the land of Moab" is a rhetorical and general expression for "in the Arboth Moab." &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; does not mean to begin, but to undertake, to take in hand, with the subordinate idea sometimes of venturing, or daring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>), sometimes of a bold resolution: here it denotes an undertaking prompted by internal impulse. Instead of being construed with the infinitive, it is construed rhetorically here with the finite verb without the copula (cf. Ges. 143, 3, b). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; probably signified to dig in the Kal; but this is not used. In the Piel it means to explain (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, explanare, lxx, Vulg.), never to engrave, or stamp, not even here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>. Here it signifies "to expound this law clearly," although the exposition was connected with an earnest admonition to preserve and obey it. "This" no doubt refers to the law expounded in what follows; but substantially it is no other than the law already given in the earlier books. "Substantially there is throughout but one law" (Schultz). That the book of Deuteronomy was not intended to furnish a new or second law, is as evident as possible from the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;. </body></html>
