These last received the gift of prophecy, and were thus enabled to relieve Moses from some of the higher responsibilities of his office by representing his mind and reproducing his personal influence in many parts of the camp at once. Jethro’s advice was given on their first arrival in Horeb: when it was carried into effect we are not told. The seventy elder were appointed (Numbers 11) between Sinai and Kadesh-barnea, shortly after they left Sinai. It is quite possible that both institutions came into existence at the same time. The seventy elders would have been of great service in the selection of the numerous judges and officers who were required.<p>(9) <span class= "bld">I am not able to bear you myself alone.</span>—Repeated almost exactly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-14.htm" title="I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.">Numbers 11:14</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-9.htm" title="And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I am not able to bear you myself alone:">Deuteronomy 1:9</a></span>. <span class="ital">I spake unto you — </span>Unto your fathers, who were alive at the time here referred to, but now dead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/26-64.htm" title="But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.">Numbers 26:64</a>. <span class="ital">At that time — </span>That is, about that time, a little before their coming to Horeb.

He owns the fulfilment of God's promise to Abraham, and prays for the further accomplishment of it. We are not straitened in the power and goodness of God; why should we be straitened in our own faith and hope?

This important arrangement for the good government of the people took place before they left Horeb to march direct to the promised land. This fact sets more clearly before us the perverseness and ingratitude of the people, to which the orator next passes; and shows, what he was anxious to impress, that the fault of the 40 years' delay rested only with themselves! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9-18.

Moses addresses that new generation as the representatives of their fathers, in whose sight and hearing all the transactions he recounts took place. A reference is here made to the suggestion of Jethro (Ex 18:18). In noticing his practical adoption of a plan by which the administration of justice was committed to a select number of subordinate officers, Moses, by a beautiful allusion to the patriarchal blessing, ascribed the necessity of that memorable change in the government to the vast increase of the population.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">At that time, </span> i.e. about that time, to wit, a little before their coming to Horeb, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-18.htm" title="You will surely wear away, both you, and this people that is with you: for this thing is too heavy for you; you are not able to perform it yourself alone.">Exodus 18:18</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I spake unto you at that time,....

This difference of date is either due to D’s move distant perspective (Introd. § 11); or as Dillm. suggests (also Bacon <span class="ital">JBS</span> xii. 24) the author of D found the passage in JE placed beside our <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/10-29.htm" title="And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses' father in law, We are journeying to the place of which the LORD said, I will give it you: come you with us, and we will do you good: for the LORD has spoken good concerning Israel....">Numbers 10:29-36</a>. See further Dri. <span class="ital">Exod.</span> p. 162. The discrepancy is of no importance. The other difference, the absence from D of Jethro’s initiative as related in JE, may be due to the summary nature of its review (Dillm.); yet the possibility of intentional omission cannot be excluded in view of the prevalent confinement of the interest in D to Israel alone.

There are also differences of language; here the forms of words, turns of rhythm and phrases, are all characteristic of D.

The people had so increased in number that Moses found himself unable to attend to all the matters that concerned them, or to adjudicate in all the differences that arose among them. God had brought to pass that which he had promised to Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-5.htm">Genesis 15:5</a>), that his seed should be as the stars of heaven for multitude; in this Moses rejoiced, nay, he would even that their numbers were, with the Divine blessing, increased a thousandfold beyond what they were. But he found the burden, the weight of care and trouble, especially in connection with their strifes and suits thereby brought on him, too much for him; and, therefore, whilst they were still at Horeb, he had, following the advice of Jethro, his father-in-law, counseled them to select competent men from among themselves, who should relieve him by attending to those duties which he found it too burdensome for him to have to attend to (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-13.htm">Exodus 18:13</a>, etc.). This appointment of captains was quite distinct from that of the elders whom God directed Moses to select that they might assist him in bearing the burden of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-10.htm">Numbers 11:10</a>, etc.). The occasion of the appointment was the same in both cases, viz. the complaint of Moses that the task was too onerous for him, but the time, the place, and the manner of the two transactions were different. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I spake unto you at that time.</span> The somewhat indefinite phrase, "at that time" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-1.htm">Genesis 38:1</a>), does not refer to the time <span class="accented">after</span> the people departed from Horeb, but to the time generally when they were in that region (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-5.htm">Exodus 18:5, 13</a>). "The imperfect (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b8;&#x5d0;&#x5b9;&#x5de;&#x5b7;&#x5d3;</span>, I spake), with <span class="accented">yaw</span> tel. expresses the order of thought and not of time" (Keil). It is not mentioned in Exodus that Moses spake to the people, as here stated, but what Jethro said to him to this effect is recorded; and as Moses proceeded to put in execution what his lather-in-law advised, it is probable that in doing so he told the people what he proposed to do, with his reasons for so doing, and obtained their assent, as here mentioned. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>To the description of the ground to which the following addresses refer, there is appended an allusion to the not less significant time when Moses delivered them, viz., "on the first of the eleventh month in the fortieth year," consequently towards the end of his life, after the conclusion of the divine lawgiving; so that he was able to speak "according to all that Jehovah had given him in commandment unto them" (the Israelites), namely, in the legislation of the former books, which is always referred to in this way (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-23.htm">Deuteronomy 4:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-29.htm">Deuteronomy 5:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-1.htm">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>). The time was also significant, from the fact that Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, had then been slain. By giving a victory over these mighty kings, the Lord had begun to fulfil His promises (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>), and had thereby laid Israel under the obligation to love, gratitude, and obedience (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21-35</a>). The suffix in &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Moses, who had smitten the Amorites at the command and by the power of Jehovah. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-4.htm">Joshua 12:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-12.htm">Joshua 13:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-31.htm">Joshua 13:31</a>; Edrei was the second capital of Og, and it is as such that it is mentioned, and not as the place where Og was defeated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-1.htm">Deuteronomy 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>). The omission of the copula &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497; is to be accounted for from the oratorical character of the introduction to the addresses which follow. Edrei is the present Dra (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-33.htm">Numbers 21:33</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>, the description of the locality is again resumed in the words "beyond the Jordan," and still further defined by the expression "in the land of Moab;" and the address itself is introduced by the clause, "Moses took in hand to expound this law," which explains more fully the &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (spake) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-3.htm">Deuteronomy 1:3</a>. "In the land of Moab" is a rhetorical and general expression for "in the Arboth Moab." &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500; does not mean to begin, but to undertake, to take in hand, with the subordinate idea sometimes of venturing, or daring (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-27.htm">Genesis 18:27</a>), sometimes of a bold resolution: here it denotes an undertaking prompted by internal impulse. Instead of being construed with the infinitive, it is construed rhetorically here with the finite verb without the copula (cf. Ges. 143, 3, b). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; probably signified to dig in the Kal; but this is not used. In the Piel it means to explain (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, explanare, lxx, Vulg.), never to engrave, or stamp, not even here nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-8.htm">Deuteronomy 27:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>. Here it signifies "to expound this law clearly," although the exposition was connected with an earnest admonition to preserve and obey it. "This" no doubt refers to the law expounded in what follows; but substantially it is no other than the law already given in the earlier books. "Substantially there is throughout but one law" (Schultz). That the book of Deuteronomy was not intended to furnish a new or second law, is as evident as possible from the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;. </body></html>
