He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amorites - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>, it is "the Amalekites and the Canaanites" who are said to have discomfited them.

People often experience distress even while in the way of duty. But how different their condition who suffer in situations where God is with them from the feelings of those who are conscious that they are in a position directly opposed to the divine will! The Israelites were grieved when they found themselves involved in difficulties and perils; but their sorrow arose not from a sense of the guilt so much as the sad effects of their perverse conduct; and "though they wept," they were not true penitents.

The Syriac version renders it, "as bees that are smoked": or irritated by smoke; which is a method that has been used, and was anciently: to dispossess them of their hives, and get their honey, as Bochart (p) from various writers has shown, as from Virgil (q), Ovid (r), and others; and when they are too much smoked become exceeding angry as Aristotle (s) and Pliny (t) observe; and which same writers take notice of the strength and force of their stings, as that they will kill with them the largest animals, even horses have been killed by them; and, though such small feeble creatures, are not afraid to attack men and beasts; yea, sometimes people have been obliged to leave their habitations, and have been driven out of their country by them, of which Aelianus (u) gives an instance; all which shows the aptness and propriety of this simile; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/118-12.htm">Psalm 118:12</a> and destroyed you in Seir, even unto Hormah; pursued them as far as Mount Seir, even to another place on the borders of Edom, which was called Hormah, either from the destruction now or afterwards made here; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>, though some take it not to be the proper name of a place, but an appellative, and render it, "even unto destruction"; so the Jerusalem Targum; that is, destroyed them with an utter destruction. <p>(p) Hierozoic, par. 2. l. 4. c. 10. col. 507.

These tribes came down from the higher mountain range to the lower height which the Israelites had gained, and drove them with great slaughter as far as Hormah, in Seir, chasing them as bees do, which pursue with keen ferocity those who disturb them. Hormah (Ban-place), the earlier name of which was Zephath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-17.htm">Judges 1:17</a>), was a royal city of the Canaanites, taken by the Israelites towards the close of their wanderings, and placed by them under a ban (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>, etc.), which ban was fully executed only in the time of the Judges. It is here and elsewhere called Hormah by anticipation. The old name Zephath seems to have survived that given to it by the Israelites in the name Sebaita or Sepata, the Arabic form of Zephath, the name of a heap of ruins on the western slope of the rocky mountain-plateau Rakhmah, about two hours and a half south-west of Khalasa (Ritter, 'Geography of Palestine,' 1:431; Palmer, 'Desert of Et-Tih,' p. 289, etc.). This is a more probable identification than that of Robinson ('Res.,' 2:18), who finds Hormah in the rocky defile of Es-Sufah, an unlikely place for a city of the importance of Zephath to be in. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Who standeth before thee," equivalent to "in thy service" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a> : for this meaning, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a>).

Joshua would divide the land among the Israelites for an inheritance, viz., (v. 39) among the young Israelites, the children of the condemned generation, whom Moses, when making a further communication of the judicial sentence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), had described as having no share in the sins of their parents, by adding, "who know not to-day what is good and evil." This expression is used to denote a condition of spiritual infancy and moral responsibility (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15-16</a>). It is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40-45</a> he proceeds to describe still further, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, how the people, by resisting the command of God to go back into the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>), had simply brought still greater calamities upon themselves, and had had to atone for the presumptuous attempt to force a way into Canaan, in opposition to the express will of the Lord, by enduring a miserable defeat. Instead of "they acted presumptuously to go up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), Moses says here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, "ye acted frivolously to go up;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>, "ye acted rashly, and went up." &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to boil, or boil over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>), signifies to act thoughtlessly, haughtily, or rashly.
