But here the spies and Israel proposed to take the guidance of their march into their own hands. It is noticeable that in the campaigns of Joshua, <span class= "ital">not one step was taken without Divine direction. </span>Thus the sending of the twelve spies, in the light in which the people intended it, was an act of unbelief. “In this thing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-32.htm" title="Yet in this thing you did not believe the LORD your God,">Deuteronomy 1:32</a>) ye did not believe the Lord your God.” (See also Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-1.htm" title="And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho.

He shows how near they were to a happy settlement in Canaan. It will aggravate the eternal ruin of hypocrites, that they were not far from the kingdom of God. As if it were not enough that they were sure of their God before them, they would send men before them. Never any looked into the Holy Land, but they must own it to be a good land. And was there any cause to distrust this God? An unbelieving heart was at the bottom of all this. All disobedience to God's laws, and distrust of his power and goodness, flow from disbelief of his word, as all true obedience springs from faith. It is profitable for us to divide our past lives into distinct periods; to give thanks to God for the mercies we have received in each, to confess and seek the forgiveness of all the sins we can remember; and thus to renew our acceptance of God's salvation, and our surrender of ourselves to his service. Our own plans seldom avail to good purpose; while courage in the exercise of faith, and in the path of duty, enables the believer to follow the Lord fully, to disregard all that opposes, to triumph over all opposition, and to take firm hold upon the promised blessings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The plan of sending the spies originated with the people; and, as in itself a reasonable one, it approved itself to Moses; it was submitted to God, sanctioned by Him, and carried out under special divine direction. The orator's purpose in this chapter is to bring before the people emphatically their own responsibilites and behavior. It is therefore important to remind them, that the sending of the spies, which led immediately to their complaining and rebellion, was their own suggestion.<p>The following verses to the end of the chapter give a condensed account, the fuller one being in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13.htm">Numbers 13-14</a>, of the occurrences which led to the banishment of the people for 40 years into the wilderness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-33. ye came &#8230; and said, We will send men before us, and they shall search us out the land&#8212;The proposal to despatch spies emanated from the people through unbelief; but Moses, believing them sincere, gave his cordial assent to this measure, and God on being consulted permitted them to follow the suggestion (see on [111]Nu 13:1).

In P, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 13:1</a> f., it is a divine command. There is no discrepancy of fact; but the difference of standpoint in describing the fact is instructive, and ought to be noticed along with other instances in D of the people’s initiative. JE has nothing on the origin of the mission of the spies; but the beginning of its narrative of the episode is broken (see above). This is one of four facts given in D of which no notice is found in JE; the other three are also given in P: (1) that the spies were twelve, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-23.htm" title="And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you, one of a tribe:">Deuteronomy 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-2.htm" title="Send you men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a ruler among them.">Numbers 13:2</a>; (2) that those who went down to Egypt with Jacob were seventy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-22.htm" title="Your fathers went down into Egypt with three score and ten persons; and now the LORD your God has made you as the stars of heaven for multitude.">Deuteronomy 10:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-27.htm" title="And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were three score and ten.">Genesis 46:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/1-5.htm" title="And all the souls that came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already.">Exodus 1:5</a>; (3) that the ark was of acacia wood, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-3.htm" title="And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of stone like to the first, and went up into the mount, having the two tables in my hand.">Deuteronomy 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-10.htm" title="And they shall make an ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a half shall be the length thereof, and a cubit and a half the breadth thereof, and a cubit and a half the height thereof.">Exodus 25:10</a>.

The congregation was to nominate, according to its tribes, wise, intelligent, and well-known men, whom Moses would appoint as heads, i.e., as judges, over the nation. At their installation he gave them the requisite instructions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm">Deuteronomy 1:16</a>): "Ye shall hear between your brethren," i.e., hear both parties as mediators, "and judge righteously, without respect of person." &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, to look at the face, equivalent to &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a>), i.e., to act partially (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2-3</a>). "The judgment is God's," i.e., appointed by God, and to be administered in the name of God, or in accordance with His justice; hence the expression "to bring before God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-7.htm">Exodus 22:7</a>, etc.).
