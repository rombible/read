The name appears very early, for Kings of the 1st Dynasty in Babylon call themselves Kings of Amurru: a name which inscriptions found at Boghaz-Keui (<span class="ital">Mitt. d. deutsch. Orient. Gesellschaft</span>, Dec. 1907, 23 f.), prove to have extended to the Euphrates; but which the Tell-el-Amarna letters (about 1400 b.c.) confine to the hinterland of Phoenicia, in the N. of Palestine. <span class="ital">Amorite</span>, in D as in E, is the general name for all the tribes dispossessed by Israel; J has Canaanite. Winckler explains this from the origin of E in N. Israel where the Amorites had been in force; while J, writing in Judah where Israel had not fought the Amorites, knew nothing of them but assigned the whole land to the Canaanites, whose civilisation had been paramount on the coast at the time of Israel’s entry and who continued to form an antithesis to Israel (<span class="ital">Gesch. Isr.</span> i. 53). If this argument were sound, then D’s extension of the name Amorite to the S. of W. Palestine would be artificial. But Winckler himself recognises the ancient character of the tradition which calls Sîḥôn an Amorite (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span> p. 52), and if the Amorites had penetrated to Moab, they had also, it is probable, extended their sovereignty as far S. on the W. of the Jordan.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and unto all … nigh thereunto</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">unto all its neighbours: the Arabah</span>, i.e. N. of the Dead Sea (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a></span>); <span class="ital">the hill-country</span>, such of the W. range as was not included under the <span class="ital">Mt of the Amorite; the lowland</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">the Shephelah</span>, the low or foot-hills between the range and the maritime plain (<span class="ital">HGHL</span>. 201 ff.); <span class="ital">the South</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">the Negeb</span>, the region to the S. of the range, which descends into the Negeb about Be’er-Sheba‘; <span class="ital">the sea-shore</span>, the maritime plain between the Shephelah and the Mediterranean, further defined as <span class="ital">the land of the Canaanites</span>, the deuteronomic writers limiting the Canaanites to the level ‘Arabah and the maritime plain, just as the Tell-el-Amarna letters call the coast land Kinaḥi = Kena‘an (so rightly Driver, while Dillm. and Steuern. take the phrase as covering all the land already defined); <span class="ital">and Lebanon</span> added to complete the land, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm" title="Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/1-4.htm" title="From the wilderness and this Lebanon even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your coast.">Joshua 1:4</a>; as far as <span class="ital">the great river, the river Euphrates</span>, the ideal but never the actual limit of Israel’s territory, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm" title="Every place where on the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the uttermost sea shall your coast be.">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>.

The mountain range of the Amorites, afterwards called the hill country of Judah and Ephraim, was the object which would first strike the view of one advancing from the south; and so, it stands here for the whole land of Canaan, with which it is in this context identified. Those "that dwell thereon" are the inhabitants of the whole of Canaan. The Amorites (Hebrew <span class="accented">Emori</span>, so called from Amor, or Emor) oftener than once appear as standing for the Canaanites generally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20, 21</a>, etc.). That all the inhabitants of Canaan are intended here is evident from the specification of the different districts of the land of Canaan which immediately follows. <span class="cmt_word">In the plain</span>: the '<span class="accented">Arabah</span> (see ver. 1). <span class="cmt_word">In the hills</span>: the hill country of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-17.htm">Numbers 13:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the vale</span>: the <span class="accented">shephelah</span>, or lowland, the country lying between the mountain range of Judah and the Mediterranean Sea, and stretching northwards from the parallel of Gaza to that of Carmel. <span class="cmt_word">In the south</span>: the <span class="accented">negeb</span>, <span class="accented">or</span> southland (literally, <span class="accented">dryness</span>), the district which formed the transition from the desert to the cultivated land, extending from the south of the Dead Sea westwards to Gaza, a vast steppe or prairie, for the most part pasture land. The seashore: the narrow strip of land on the coast of the Mediterranean from <span class="accented">Joppa to</span> Tyre (in the New Testament, "the coast of Tyre and Sidon," <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The land of the Canaanites</span>: the whole country of which these were the separate parts. <span class="cmt_word">And unto Lebanon</span>: the <span class="accented">Whale Mountain</span>, so called, probably, from the snow which rests on its summit. <span class="cmt_word">The great river, the river Euphrates</span>. The Phrath, or Euphrates, which has its sources in the mountains of Armenia, and in its course divides Armenia from Cappadocia, formed the eastern limit of the territory promised by God to Abraham. The epithet "great" seems to have been commonly applied to it. Callimachus calls it '<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x3a3;&#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> ('In Apoll.,' 107), and Lucan has- <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="foreign">"Quaque caput rapido tollit cum Tigride<br />magnus Euphrates."</span><br /><br />(<span class="note_acc">Phars.,' 3:256.</span>) As by much the most considerable river of western Asia, the Euphrates was known <span class="accented">as</span> "the river" <span class="accented">par</span> <span class="accented">excellence</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-7.htm">Isaiah 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm">Psalm 72:8</a>). The mention of Lebanon and the Euphrates is not, as Keil <span class="accented">suggests</span>, "to be attributed to the rhetorical fullness of the style;" but is due to the fact that these were included in what God promised to Abraham and his seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-31.htm">Exodus 23:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1-4</a> contain the heading to the whole book; and to this the introduction to the first address is appended in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>. By the expression, "These be the words," etc., Deuteronomy is attached to the previous books; the word "these," which refers to the addresses that follow, connects what follows with what goes before, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-4.htm">Genesis 2:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/6-9.htm">Genesis 6:9</a>, etc. The geographical data in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> present no little difficulty; for whilst the general statement as to the place where Moses delivered the addresses in this book, viz., beyond Jordan, is particularized in the introduction to the second address (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>), as "in the valley over against Beth-Peor," here it is described as "in the wilderness, in the Arabah," etc. This contrast between the verse before us and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-45.htm">Deuteronomy 4:45-46</a>, and still more the introduction of the very general and loose expression, "in the desert," which is so little adapted for a geographical definition of the locality, that it has to be defined itself by the additional words "in the Arabah," suggest the conclusion that the particular names introduced are not intended to furnish as exact a geographical account as possible of the spot where Moses explained the law to all Israel, but to call up to view the scene of the addresses which follow, and point out the situation of all Israel at that time. Israel was "in the desert," not yet in Canaan the promised inheritance, and in fact "in the Arabah." This is the name given to the deep low-lying plain on both sides of the Jordan, which runs from the Lake of Gennesaret to the Dead Sea, and stretches southwards from the Dead Sea to Aila, at the northern extremity of the Red Sea, as we may see very clearly from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>, where the way which the Israelites took past Edom to Aila is called the "way of the Arabah," and also from the fact that the Dead Sea is called "the sea of the Arabah" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>. At present the name Arabah is simply attached to the southern half of this valley, between the Dead Sea and the Red Sea; whilst the northern part, between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee, is called el Ghor; though Abulfeda, Ibn Haukal, and other Arabic geographers, extend the name Ghor from the Lake of Gennesaret to Aila (cf. Ges. thes. p. 1166; Hengstenberg, Balaam, p. 520; Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 596). - &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507; &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;, "over against Suph" (&#1502;&#1493;&#1500; for &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-29.htm">Deuteronomy 3:29</a>, etc., for the sake of euphony, to avoid the close connection of the two 8-sounds). Suph is probably a contraction of &#1497;&#1501;&#1470;&#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1507;, "the Red Sea" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-19.htm">Exodus 10:19</a>). This name is given not only to the Gulf of Suez (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-18.htm">Exodus 13:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-4.htm">Exodus 15:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>, etc.), but to that of Akabah also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>, etc.). There is no other Suph that would be at all suitable here. The lxx have rendered it &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;; and Onkelos and others adopt the same rendering. This description cannot serve as a more precise definition of the Arabah, in which case &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; (which) would have to be supplied before &#1502;&#1493;&#1500;, since "the Arabah actually touches the Red Sea." Nor does it point out the particular spot in the Arabah where the addresses were delivered, as Knobel supposes; or indicate the connection between the Arboth Moab and the continuation of the Arabah on the other side of the Dead Sea, and point out the Arabah in all this extent as the heart of the country over which the Israelites had moved during the whole of their forty years' wandering (Hengstenberg). For although the Israelites passed twice through the Arabah, it formed by no means the heart of the country in which they continued for forty years. The words "opposite to Suph," when taken in connection with the following names, cannot have any other object than to define with greater exactness the desert in which the Israelites had moved during the forty years. Moses spoke to all Israel on the other side of the Jordan, when it was still in the desert, in the Arabah, still opposite to the Red Sea, after crossing which it had entered the wilderness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-22.htm">Exodus 15:22</a>), "between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Di-Sahab." Paran is at all events not the desert of this name in all its extent, but the place of encampment in the "desert of Paran" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-12.htm">Numbers 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>), i.e., the district of Kadesh in the desert of Zin (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-21.htm">Numbers 13:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-26.htm">Numbers 13:26</a>); and Hazeroth is most probably the place of encampment of that name mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-35.htm">Numbers 11:35</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12-16.htm">Numbers 12:16</a>, from which Israel entered the desert of Paran. Both places had been very eventful to the Israelites. At Hazeroth, Miriam the prophetess and Aaron the high priest had stumbled through rebellion against Moses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/12.htm">Numbers 12</a>). In the desert of Paran by Kadesh the older generation had been rejected, and sentenced to die in the wilderness on account of its repeated rebellion against the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14.htm">Numbers 14</a>); and when the younger generation that had grown up in the wilderness assembled once more in Kadesh to set out for Canaan, even Moses and Aaron, the two heads of the nation, sinned there at the water of strife, so that they two were not permitted to enter Canaan, whilst Miriam died there at that time (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20.htm">Numbers 20</a>). But if Paran and Hazeroth are mentioned on account of the tragical events connected with these places, it is natural to conclude that there were similar reasons for mentioning the other three names as well.<p>Tophel is supposed by Hengstenberg (Balaam, p. 517) and Robinson (Pal. ii. p. 570) and all the more modern writers, to be the large village of Tafyleh, with six hundred inhabitants, the chief place in Jebal, on the western side of the Edomitish mountains, in a well-watered valley of the wady of the same name, with large plantations of fruit-trees (Burckhardt, Syr. pp. 677, 678). The Israelites may have come upon this place in the neighbourhood of Oboth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10-11</a>); and as its inhabitants, according to Burckhardt, p. 680, supply the Syrian caravans with a considerable quantity of provisions, which they sell to them in the castle of el Ahsa, Schultz conjectures that it may have been here that the people of Israel purchased food and drink of the Edomites for money (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), and that Tafyleh is mentioned as a place of refreshment, where the Israelites partook for the first time of different food from the desert supply. There is a great deal to be said in favour of this conjecture: for even if the Israelites did not obtain different food for the first time at this place, the situation of Tophel does warrant the supposition that it was here that they passed for the first time from the wilderness to an inhabited land; on which account the place was so memorable for them, that it might very well be mentioned as being the extreme east of their wanderings in the desert, as the opposite point to the encampment at Paran, where they first arrived on the western side of their wandering, at the southern border of Canaan. Laban is generally identified with Libnah, the second place of encampment on the return journey from Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-22.htm">Numbers 33:22</a>), and may perhaps have been the place referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16.htm">Numbers 16</a>, but not more precisely defined, where the rebellion of the company of Korah occurred. Lastly, Di-Sahab has been identified by modern commentators with Mersa Dahab or Mina Dahab, i.e., gold-harbour, a place upon a tongue of land in the Elanitic Gulf, about the same latitude as Sinai, where there is nothing to be seen now except a quantity of date-trees, a few sand-hills, and about a dozen heaps of stones piled up irregularly, but all showing signs of having once been joined together (cf. Burckhardt, pp. 847-8; and Ritter, Erdk. xiv. pp. 226ff.). But this is hardly correct. As Roediger has observed (on Wellsted's Reisen, ii. p. 127), "the conjecture has been based exclusively upon the similarity of name, and there is not the slightest exegetical tradition to favour it." But similarity of names cannot prove anything by itself, as the number of places of the same name, but in different localities, that we meet with in the Bible, is very considerable. Moreover, the further assumption which is founded upon this conjecture, namely, that the Israelites went from Sinai past Dahab, not only appears untenable for the reasons given above, but is actually rendered impossible by the locality itself. The approach to this tongue of land, which projects between two steep lines of coast, with lofty mountain ranges of from 800 to 2000 feet in height on both north and south, leads from Sinai through far too narrow and impracticable a valley for the Israelites to be able to march thither and fix an encampment there.<p>(Note: From the mouth of the valley through the masses of the primary mountains to the sea-coast, there is a fan-like surface of drifts of primary rock, the radius of which is thirty-five minutes long, the progressive work of the inundations of an indefinable course of thousands of years" (Rppell, Nubien, p. 206).)<p>And if Israel cannot have touched Dahab on its march, every probability vanishes that Moses should have mentioned this place here, and the name Di-Sahab remains at present undeterminable. But in spite of our ignorance of this place, and notwithstanding the fact that even the conjecture expressed with regard to Laban is very uncertain, there can be no well-founded doubt that the words "between Paran and Tophel" are to be understood as embracing the whole period of the thirty-seven years of mourning, at the commencement of which Israel was in Paran, whilst at the end they sought to enter Canaan by Tophel (the Edomitish Tafyleh), and that the expression "opposite to Suph" points back to their first entrance into the desert. - Looking from the steppes of Moab over the ground that the Israelites had traversed, Suph, where they first entered the desert of Arabia, would lie between Paran, where the congregation arrived at the borders of Canaan towards the west, and Tophel, where they first ended their desert wanderings thirty-seven years later on the east.</body></html>
