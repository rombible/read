They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In mount Ebal - Compare the marginal references. The Samaritan Pentateuch and Version read here Gerizim instead of Ebal; but the original text was probably, as nearly all modern authorities hold, altered in order to lend a show of scriptural sanction to the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.<p>The erection of the altar, the offering thereon burnt-offerings and peace-offerings <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-6.htm">Deuteronomy 27:6-7</a>, the publication of the Law in writing, form altogether a solemn renewal of the covenant on the entrance of the people into the promised land, and recall the ceremonies observed on the original grant of the covenant at Sinai (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>). And Ebal (the mount of "barrenness "),the mount of cursing, was the fitting spot on which to celebrate them. For the curses were the penalties under which the children of Israel bound themselves to keep the Law. Suitably also was the same place selected as that in which were to be set up both the monumental stones containing the Law, and the altar at which the covenant was to be renewed. We must note too the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> ff set out verbatim the curses only, the blessings being omitted. The law because of man's sinfulness brings on him first and chiefly a curse: compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. there shalt thou build an altar &#8230; of whole stones&#8212;The stones were to be in their natural state, as if a chisel would communicate pollution to them. The stony pile was to be so large as to contain all the conditions of the covenant, so elevated as to be visible to the whole congregation of Israel; and the religious ceremonial performed on the occasion was to consist: first, of the elementary worship needed for sinful men; and secondly, of the peace offerings, or lively, social feasts, that were suited to the happy people whose God was the Lord. There were thus, the law which condemned, and the typical expiation&#8212;the two great principles of revealed religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whole stones; </span> i.e. not hewed or polished. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shall build the altar of the Lord thy God of whole stones,....

"And that it should become a holy people unto the Lord," as He had already said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>. The sanctification of Israel was the design and end of its divine election, and would be accomplished in the glory to which the people of God were to be exalted (see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). The Hiphil &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, which is only found here, has no other meaning than this, "to cause a person to say," or "give him occasion to say;" and this is perfectly appropriate here, whereas the other meaning suggested, "to exalt," has no tenable support either in the paraphrastic rendering of these verses in the ancient versions, or in the Hithpael in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/94-4.htm">Psalm 94:4</a>, and moreover is altogether unsuitable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-17.htm">Deuteronomy 26:17</a>. </body></html>
