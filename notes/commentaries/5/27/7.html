They must set up an altar. The word and prayer must go together. Though they might not, of their own heads, set up any altar besides that at the tabernacle; yet, by the appointment of God, they might, upon special occasion. This altar must be made of unhewn stones, such as they found upon the field. Christ, our Altar, is a stone cut out of the mountain without hands, refused by the builders, as having no form or comeliness, but accepted of God the Father, and made the Head of the corner. In the Old Testament the words of the law are written, with the curse annexed; which would overcome us with horror, if we had not, in the New Testament, an altar erected close by, which gives consolation. Blessed be God, the printed copies of the Scriptures among us, do away the necessity of such methods as were presented to Israel. The end of the gospel ministry is, and the end of preachers ought to be, to make the word of God as plain as possible. Yet, unless the Spirit of God prosper such labours with Divine power, we shall not, even by these means, be made wise unto salvation: for this blessing we should therefore daily and earnestly pray.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In mount Ebal - Compare the marginal references. The Samaritan Pentateuch and Version read here Gerizim instead of Ebal; but the original text was probably, as nearly all modern authorities hold, altered in order to lend a show of scriptural sanction to the Samaritan temple on Mount Gerizim.<p>The erection of the altar, the offering thereon burnt-offerings and peace-offerings <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-6.htm">Deuteronomy 27:6-7</a>, the publication of the Law in writing, form altogether a solemn renewal of the covenant on the entrance of the people into the promised land, and recall the ceremonies observed on the original grant of the covenant at Sinai (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>). And Ebal (the mount of "barrenness "),the mount of cursing, was the fitting spot on which to celebrate them. For the curses were the penalties under which the children of Israel bound themselves to keep the Law. Suitably also was the same place selected as that in which were to be set up both the monumental stones containing the Law, and the altar at which the covenant was to be renewed. We must note too the fact that <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-15.htm">Deuteronomy 27:15</a> ff set out verbatim the curses only, the blessings being omitted. The law because of man's sinfulness brings on him first and chiefly a curse: compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-10. there shalt thou build an altar &#8230; of whole stones&#8212;The stones were to be in their natural state, as if a chisel would communicate pollution to them. The stony pile was to be so large as to contain all the conditions of the covenant, so elevated as to be visible to the whole congregation of Israel; and the religious ceremonial performed on the occasion was to consist: first, of the elementary worship needed for sinful men; and secondly, of the peace offerings, or lively, social feasts, that were suited to the happy people whose God was the Lord. There were thus, the law which condemned, and the typical expiation&#8212;the two great principles of revealed religion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/27.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shall offer peace offerings,.... Part of which belonged to God, which was burnt on the altar, and another part to the priest that offered them; and the rest to the owner that brought them, which he eat of with his friends; so it follows: <p>and shall eat there, and rejoice before the Lord thy God: now this altar, where these sacrifices were offered, was on the very spot where the stones were on which the law was written; and may point at the gracious provision God has made for the redemption of his people from the curse of it by Christ, who became a substitute for them in their legal place and stead. The altar being of rough unhewn stones was a type of him in his human nature, who is the stone in the vision cut out of the mountain without hands; and being unpolished may denote the meanness of his outward appearance, on account of which he was rejected by the Jewish builders; and no iron tool being to be lifted up on them, may signify that nothing of man's is to be added to the sacrifice and satisfaction of Christ, and salvation by him; and this being in Ebal, where the curses were pronounced, shows that Christ, by the offering up of himself for the sins of his people, has made atonement for them, and thereby has delivered them from the curse of the law, being made a curse for them; all which is matter of joy and gladness to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and rejoice before the LORD thy God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">peace offerings</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">shelamîm</span>, rather <span class="ital">offerings in fulfilment</span> of laws and vows; not elsewhere in Deut. and here representing the <span class="ital">zebaḥîm</span>, EVV. <span class="ital">sacrifices</span>, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm" title="And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>, etc.; as the vb. here conjoined with it shows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">eat … reioice</span>, etc.] Phrases of D; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-7.htm" title="And there you shall eat before the LORD your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, wherein the LORD your God has blessed you.">Deuteronomy 12:7</a>.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1</a> to keep the whole law (&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;, inf. abs. for the imperative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-3.htm">Exodus 13:3</a>, etc.), with which the instructions that follow are introduced, indicates at the very outset the purpose for which the law written upon stones was to be set up in Canaan, namely, as a public testimony that the Israelites who were entering into Canaan possessed in the law their rule and source of life. The command itself is given by Moses, together with the elders, because the latter had to see to the execution of it after Moses' death; on the other hand, the priests are mentioned along with Moses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9</a>, because it was their special duty to superintend the fulfilment of the commands of God.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-1.htm">Deuteronomy 27:1-3</a><p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-2.htm">Deuteronomy 27:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-3.htm">Deuteronomy 27:3</a> contain the general instructions; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-4.htm">Deuteronomy 27:4-8</a>, more minute details. In the appointment of the time, "on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan into the land," etc., the word "day" must not be pressed, but is to be understood in a broader sense, as signifying the time when Israel should have entered the land and taken possession of it. The stones to be set up were to be covered with lime, or gypsum (whether sid signifies lime or gypsum cannot be determined), and all the words of the law were to be written upon them. The writing, therefore, was not to be cut into the stones and then covered with lime (as J. D. Mich., Ros.), but to be inscribed upon the plaistered stones, as was the custom in Egypt, where the walls of buildings, and even monumental stones, which they were about to paint with figures and hieroglyphics, were first of all covered with a coating of lime or gypsum, and then the figures painted upon this (see the testimonies of Minutoli, Heeren, Prokesch in Hengstenberg's Dissertations, i. 433, and Egypt and the Books of Moses, p. 90). The object of this writing was not to hand down the law in this manner to posterity without alteration, but, as has already been stated, simply to set forth a public acknowledgement of the law on the part of the people, first of all for the sake of the generation which took possession of the land, and for posterity, only so far as this act was recorded in the book of Joshua and thus transmitted to future generations.</body></html>
