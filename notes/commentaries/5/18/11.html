Or rather, as the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">חבר חבר</span>, <span class="ital">chober chaber, </span>seems to mean, <span class="ital">an astrologer, </span>or such as, by the conjunction of the planets, pretended to foretel the events of men’s lives, or other future things. It must be observed that the eastern people were much addicted to divination of all kinds, and undertook no enterprise of importance without consulting their soothsayers; and therefore Moses uses these sundry expressions that he might prohibit it in all its forms. <span class="ital">A consulter with familiar spirits — </span>The original words <span class="greekheb">שׁאל אוב</span><span class="ital">, shoel ob, </span>are here rendered by the Seventy, <span class="greekheb">εγγαστριμυθος</span>, one that speaks out of his belly: but literally, it is one that consults or inquires of <span class="ital">Ob. </span>This word originally means a <span class="ital">bottle, </span>and was the name which the Hebrews gave to the spirit which was supposed to agitate these ventriloquists, because their bodies were violently distended, like leather bottles full of wine and ready to burst. See Doddridge on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a>, where both St. Paul and St. Luke evidently consider the girl spoken of as being really possessed by what is there termed <span class="greekheb">πνευμα πυθωνος</span>, a spirit of python, or divination, because the Greeks supposed it to be an inspiration from their god Apollo, whom they termed Pythius.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">A wizard — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">A knowing man; </span>who by any forbidden ways undertakes the revelation of secret things.

A necromancer — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">One that seeketh unto the dead; </span>that calleth up and inquires of them, as the witch of Endor is represented to have done. Dr. Waterland, after the Seventy, renders it, very properly, <span class="ital">one that consults the dead. </span>Their manner of doing this is stated to have been by visiting their graves in the night, and there lying down and muttering certain words with a low voice, by which means they pretended to have communion with them by dreams, or by the dead appearing to them. To this Isaiah has been thought to allude, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-19.htm" title="And it shall be, if you do at all forget the LORD your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.">Deuteronomy 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-4.htm" title="Yet the LORD has not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.">Deuteronomy 29:4</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-14 Was it possible that a people so blessed with Divine institutions, should ever be in any danger of making those their teachers whom God had made their captives? They were in danger; therefore, after many like cautions, they are charged not to do after the abominations of the nations of Canaan. All reckoning of lucky or unlucky days, all charms for diseases, all amulets or spells to prevent evil, fortune-telling, &c. are here forbidden. These are so wicked as to be a chief cause of the rooting out of the Canaanites. It is amazing to think that there should be any pretenders of this kind in such a land, and day of light, as we live in. They are mere impostors who blind and cheat their followers.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A charmer - i. e., one who fascinates and subdues noxious animals or men, such as the famous serpent-charmers of the East <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/58-4.htm">Psalm 58:4-5</a>.<p>A consulter with familiar spirits ... a wizard - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a> note.<p>Recromancer - literally, "one who interrogates the dead."

That pretends to cure diseases by charms, or a charmer of serpents; according to Jarchi, one that gathers together serpents and scorpions, and other animals, into one place; with which agree the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem,"which bind serpents and scorpions, and all kind of creeping things;''but, according to Aben Ezra, one that says certain words to gather demons together: <p>or a consulter with familiar spirits; or the inquirer of "Ob", or the bottle, which the Jews interpret of Python, or one that has the spirit of Python; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm">Acts 16:16</a>, a ventriloquist, one that spoke or seemed to speak out of his belly, or from under his armpits; so it is said in the Misnah (h) of Ob, this is Python, one that speaks out of his arm holes; agreeably to which, Jarchi says, this is that sort of witchcraft which is called Python, and he speaks from his arm holes, and brings up the dead thither: of Baal Ob, or the master of the bottle, say some Jewish writers, one way he uses is, he takes the skull of a dead man, the flesh of which is consumed from it, and he hides it and burns incense to it, and mutters words by it, and hears from it, as if from a dead man (k): or a wizard: a knowing one, as the word signifies, such an one as we call a cunning man; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>. <p>or a necromancer that inquiries of the dead, or seeks instruction from them, as the Targum of Jerusalem. Aben Ezra describes him as one that goes to burying grounds, and takes the bone of a dead man, and because of his wild imagination there appears to him the likeness of forms; or as Maimonides (l), better still, he is one that fasts and sleeps in graveyards, and utters words; and, according to his imagination, sees future things in dreams. <p>(h) Misn.
