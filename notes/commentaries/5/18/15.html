He still “speaketh from heaven.” But He “descended first into the lower parts of the earth.” He has “the keys of hell and of death;” and knows all their secrets. They who can draw near to Him have no need to look downward, to consult dead relatives, or seek knowledge from spirits whose character, even if <span class= "ital">they </span>are accessible, is beyond our discernment. The Holy Spirit, our Comforter and Advocate on earth, and the Prophet, our Advocate that speaketh from heaven, are enough for all human need. What we cannot learn from them, or from the light they give us, it is better not to know.<p>(16) <span class= "bld">According to all that thou desiredst . . . in Horeb.</span>—It should never be forgotten that the Prophet like to Moses was promised on “the day of the assembly.” The Holy Spirit, who is Christ in us, was promised on the day of the delivery of the “letter that killeth.” (See also on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-28.htm" title="And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and the LORD said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.">Deuteronomy 5:28</a>.)<p>(18) <span class= "bld">He shall speak unto them all that I shall command him.</span>—“The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself” (our Lord, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-10.htm" title="Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak to you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwells in me, he does the works.">John 14:10</a>). “He shall not speak of Himself.

Moses was now about to leave his people, and therefore informs them, for their comfort, that God would raise them up another prophet, who should speak unto them God’s words, and instruct them in his will. He has been understood by many eminent persons as foretelling hereby that God would raise up a succession of prophets in the Jewish Church for the instruction of his people. And, perhaps, this interpretation is not to be altogether rejected,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1st, Because this prediction is alleged here as a reason why they need not consult with diviners, as they should have prophets at hand to advise them whenever it was needful. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2d, Because the prophet here spoken of is opposed to the <span class="ital">false </span>prophets, and a general rule is hereupon given for the discovery of all succeeding prophets, whether true or false, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die....">Deuteronomy 18:20-22</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3d, Because, as is here threatened, whenever the people did not hearken to, and obey these prophets, God <span class="ital">required it </span>of them, punishing them repeatedly, and that in a signal manner, by the sword of their enemies, by famine, and by captivity, especially the captivity of the ten tribes under Shalmaneser, the king of Assyria, and the captivity of Judah and Benjamin by Nebuchadnezzar, with the awful calamities preceding and following.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The prediction, however, must of necessity be primarily interpreted of the Messiah. 1st, Because the text speaks of <span class="ital">one </span>prophet only, in the singular number, and not of <span class="ital">many. </span>2d, Because the Messiah alone can with propriety be said to have been a prophet <span class="ital">like unto Moses, </span>it being simply denied, and that repeatedly, that any other prophet did, or should arise, like unto him. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deuteronomy 34:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/12-6.htm" title="And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream....">Numbers 12:6-8</a>. God spoke to the other prophets in dreams and visions, or by the appearance of angels, but he conversed with Moses in a free and familiar way, <span class="ital">mouth to mouth, and face to face, </span>as it is expressed, as a man converses with his friend, Moses having his light in the divine will immediately from God, without the intervention of dreams, visions, or the appearance of angels. They only expounded and enforced the laws of God already given, none of them being, properly speaking, <span class="ital">lawgivers, </span>in the intermediate space between Moses and Christ. But Moses was properly a lawgiver, and that in a very extraordinary sense, delivering a law which was in general entirely new, and that with such authority and attestations from God, as had never been witnessed on earth before. Not many of these prophets wrought miracles, and those who did, can with no propriety be said to have resembled Moses in that respect. The first and the last of these instances of dissimilitude are particularly noticed in one of the passages above referred to. “There arose not a prophet in Israel like unto Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face; in all the signs and wonders which the Lord sent him to do in the land of Egypt; and in all that mighty hand and great terror which Moses showed in the sight of all Israel.” Add to all this that Moses was a <span class="ital">mediator </span>and a <span class="ital">king </span>as well as a prophet, in the former of which characters none of the ancient prophets resembled him, and none, except David, in the latter. But Christ was truly like him in all these greater, and in a variety of lesser respects. He was not only a prophet, but a priest and mediator, a king and lawgiver; and not only fully equalled, but infinitely surpassed Moses in the excellence of his ministry and work, the glory of his miracles, and in his familiar and intimate converse with God; being in <span class="ital">the bosom of the Father, </span>and the <span class="ital">wisdom </span>and <span class="ital">word </span>of God incarnate. 3d, The awful threatening denounced in this passage, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that whoever will not listen to my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him.">Deuteronomy 18:19</a>,) was most signally fulfilled with respect to those of the Jews that did not hearken to this prophet: the Lord most terribly required it of them, and continues to require it. For wrath came upon them to the uttermost, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Forbidding us to speak to the Gentiles that they might be saved, to fill up their sins always: for the wrath is come on them to the uttermost.">1 Thessalonians 2:16</a>,) by the Roman armies, in the siege and destruction of their cities, and especially of Jerusalem their capital city, and the utter ruin of their country; and the sad effects of that wrath they have felt for upward of seventeen hundred years, and continue to feel to this day. But, 4th, What perfectly places the matter beyond all doubt, this prophecy is expounded by God himself of Christ, and of Christ <span class="ital">alone, </span>in the New Testament. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-22.htm" title="For Moses truly said to the fathers, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear in all things whatever he shall say to you.">Acts 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-37.htm" title="This is that Moses, which said to the children of Israel, A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brothers, like to me; him shall you hear.">Acts 7:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-45.htm" title="Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, did write, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.">John 1:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/5-45.htm" title="Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father: there is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust....">John 5:45-46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:15-22 It is here promised concerning Christ, that there should come a Prophet, great above all the prophets; by whom God would make known himself and his will to the children of men, more fully and clearly than he had ever done before. He is the Light of the world, Joh 8:12. He is the World by whom God speaks to us, Joh 1:1; Heb 1:2. In his birth he should be one of their nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS; and is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, Joh 12:48. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets. It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is not that which the Lord has spoken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ancient fathers of the Church and the generality of modern commentators have regarded our Lord as the prophet promised in these verses. It is evident from the New Testament alone that the Messianic was the accredited interpretation among the Jews at the beginning of the Christian era (compare the marginal references, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); nor can our Lord Himself, when He declares that Moses "wrote of Him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45-47</a>, be supposed to have any other words more directly in view than these, the only words in which Moses, speaking in his own person, gives any prediction of the kind. But the verses seem to have a further, no less evident if subsidiary, reference to a prophetical order which should stand from time to time, as Moses had done, between God and the people; which should make known God's will to the latter; which should by its presence render it unnecessary either that God should address the people directly, as at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm">Deuteronomy 5:25</a> ff), or that the people themselves in lack of counsel should resort to the superstitions of the pagan.<p>In fact, in the words before us, Moses gives promise both of a prophetic order, and of the Messiah in particular as its chief; of a line of prophets culminating in one eminent individual. And in proportion as we see in our Lord the characteristics of the prophet most perfectly exhibited, so must we regard the promise of Moses as in Him most completely accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 18:15-19. Christ the Prophet Is to Be Heard.<p>15-19. The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet&#8212;The insertion of this promise, in connection with the preceding prohibition, might warrant the application (which some make of it) to that order of true prophets whom God commissioned in unbroken succession to instruct, to direct, and warn His people; and in this view the purport of it is, "There is no need to consult with diviners and soothsayers, as I shall afford you the benefit of divinely appointed prophets, for judging of whose credentials a sure criterion is given" (De 18:20-22). But the prophet here promised was pre-eminently the Messiah, for He alone was "like unto Moses" (see on [156]De 34:10) "in His mediatorial character; in the peculiar excellence of His ministry; in the number, variety, and magnitude of His miracles; in His close and familiar communion with God; and in His being the author of a new dispensation of religion." This prediction was fulfilled fifteen hundred years afterwards and was expressly applied to Jesus Christ by Peter (Ac 3:22, 23), and by Stephen (Ac 7:37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Will raise up, </span> i.e. will produce and send into the world in due time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A Prophet:</span> those words may be understood secondarily concerning the succession of prophets which God would raise for the instruction of his church, both because this is alleged as an argument why they need not consult with diviners, &c., because they should have prophets at hand whensoever it was needful to advise them, and because this Prophet is opposed to the false prophet; and a general rule is hereupon given for the discovery of all succeeding prophets, whether they be true or false, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/18-20.htm" title="But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die....">Deu 18:20-22</a></span>; but they are chiefly to be understood of Christ, as the following words show, which do not truly and fully agree to any other; particularly where he is said to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">like unto Moses, </span> which is simply denied concerning all other prophets, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-10.htm" title="And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like to Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,">Deu 34:10</a></span>, and therefore it is not probable that it should be simply affirmed concerning all true prophets succeeding him.

Hence Abraham is called a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-7.htm">Genesis 20:7</a>), and the term is applied to the patriarchs generally (<span class="accented">Psalm</span> 105:15); God conveyed his mind to them, and they spoke it forth to others (cf. <span class="accented">Amos</span> 3:7). <span class="cmt_word">Like unto me.</span> When the people heard the voice of God speaking to them at Sinai, and from the midst of the fire uttering to them the Ten Words, they were struck with terror, and besought that they might not again hear that awful voice, but that Moses might act as mediator between God and them - might hear what God should <span class="accented">say</span>, and speak it unto them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-22.htm">Deuteronomy 5:22-27</a>). Moses thus became God's prophet to the people; and of this he reminds them here, as well as of the circumstances amid which he entered specially on this office (cf. vers. 16, 17). The phrase, "<span class="accented">like</span> unto <span class="accented">me</span>," does not necessarily imply  that the prophet who was to come after Moses was to be in every respect the same as he; all that is indicated is that he would act as Moses had acted as a mediator between God and the people in the way of conveying his will to them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Gift of Prophecy. - The Levitical priests, as the stated guardians and promoters of the law, had to conduct all the affairs of Israel with the Lord, not only instructing the people out of the law concerning the will of God, but sustaining and promoting the living fellowship with the Lord both of individuals and of the whole congregation, by the offering of sacrifices and service at the altar. But if the covenant fellowship with Himself and His grace, in which Jehovah had placed Israel as His people of possession, was to be manifested and preserved as a living reality amidst all changes in the political development of the nation and in the circumstances of private life, it would not do for the revelations from God to cease with the giving of the law and the death of Moses. For, as Schultz observes, "however the revelation of the law might aim at completeness, and even have regard to the more remote circumstances of the future, as, for example, where the king is referred to; yet in the transition from extraordinary circumstances into a more settled condition, which it foretells in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, and which actually took place under Samuel when the nation grew older (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-25.htm">Deuteronomy 4:25</a>), and in the decline and apostasy which certainly awaited it according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm">Deuteronomy 31:16-29</a>, when false prophets should arise, by whom they were in danger of being led astray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-2.htm">Deuteronomy 13:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-20.htm">Deuteronomy 18:20</a>), as well as in the restoration which would follow after the infliction of punishment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-29.htm">Deuteronomy 4:29-30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1</a>.); in all these great changes which awaited Israel from inward necessity, the revelation of the will of the Lord which they possessed in the law would nevertheless be insufficient." The priesthood, with its ordinances, would not suffice for that. As the promise of direct communications from God through the Urim and Thummim of the high priest was restricted to the single circumstance of the right of the whole congregation being endangered, and did not extend to the satisfaction of the religious necessities of individuals, it could afford no godly satisfaction to that desire for supernatural knowledge which arose at times in the hearts of individuals, and for which the heathen oracles made such ample provision in ungodly ways. If Israel therefore was to be preserved in faithfulness towards God, and attain the end of its calling as the congregation of the Lord, it was necessary that the Lord should make known His counsel and will at the proper time through the medium of prophets, and bestow upon it in sure prophetic words what the heathen nations endeavoured to discover and secure by means of augury and soothsaying. This is the point of view from which Moses promises the sending of prophets in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>, and lays down in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-19.htm">Deuteronomy 18:19-22</a> the criteria for distinguishing between true and false prophets, as we may clearly see from the fact that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-14</a> he introduces this promise with a warning against resorting to heathen augury, soothsaying, and witchcraft.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-9.htm">Deuteronomy 18:9-11</a><p>When Israel came into the land of Canaan, it was "not to learn to do like the abominations of these nations" (the Canaanites or heathen). There was not to be found in it any who caused his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, i.e., any worshipper of Moloch (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>), or one who practised soothsaying (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-23.htm">Numbers 23:23</a>), or a wizard (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>), or a snake-charmer (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-26.htm">Leviticus 19:26</a>), or a conjurer, or one who pronounced a ban (&#1495;&#1489;&#1512; &#1495;&#1489;&#1512;, probably referring to the custom of binding or banning by magical knots), a necromancer and wise man (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-31.htm">Leviticus 19:31</a>), or one who asked the dead, i.e., who sought oracles from the dead. Moses groups together all the words which the language contained for the different modes of exploring the future and discovering the will of God, for the purpose of forbidding every description of soothsaying, and places the prohibition of Moloch-worship at the head, to show the inward connection between soothsaying and idolatry, possibly because februation, or passing children through the fire in the worship of Moloch, was more intimately connected with soothsaying and magic than and other description of idolatry.</body></html>
