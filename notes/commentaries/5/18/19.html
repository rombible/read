He is the Light of the world, Joh 8:12. He is the World by whom God speaks to us, Joh 1:1; Heb 1:2. In his birth he should be one of their nation. In his resurrection he should be raised up at Jerusalem, and from thence his doctrine should go forth to all the world. Thus God, having raised up his Son Christ Jesus, sent him to bless us. He should be like unto Moses, only above him. This prophet is come, even JESUS; and is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. The view of God which he gives, will not terrify or overwhelm, but encourages us. He speaks with fatherly affection and Divine authority united. Whoever refuses to listen to Jesus Christ, shall find it is at his peril; the same that is the Prophet is to be his Judge, Joh 12:48. Woe then to those who refuse to hearken to His voice, to accept His salvation, or yield obedience to His sway! But happy they who trust in Him, and obey Him. He will lead them in the paths of safety and peace, until He brings them to the land of perfect light, purity, and happiness. Here is a caution against false prophets. It highly concerns us to have a right touchstone wherewith to try the word we hear, that we may know what that word is which the Lord has not spoken. Whatever is against the plain sense of the written word, or which gives countenance or encouragement to sin, we may be sure is not that which the Lord has spoken.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The ancient fathers of the Church and the generality of modern commentators have regarded our Lord as the prophet promised in these verses. It is evident from the New Testament alone that the Messianic was the accredited interpretation among the Jews at the beginning of the Christian era (compare the marginal references, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-25.htm">John 4:25</a>); nor can our Lord Himself, when He declares that Moses "wrote of Him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-45.htm">John 5:45-47</a>, be supposed to have any other words more directly in view than these, the only words in which Moses, speaking in his own person, gives any prediction of the kind. But the verses seem to have a further, no less evident if subsidiary, reference to a prophetical order which should stand from time to time, as Moses had done, between God and the people; which should make known God's will to the latter; which should by its presence render it unnecessary either that God should address the people directly, as at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-16.htm">Deuteronomy 18:16</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-25.htm">Deuteronomy 5:25</a> ff), or that the people themselves in lack of counsel should resort to the superstitions of the pagan.<p>In fact, in the words before us, Moses gives promise both of a prophetic order, and of the Messiah in particular as its chief; of a line of prophets culminating in one eminent individual. And in proportion as we see in our Lord the characteristics of the prophet most perfectly exhibited, so must we regard the promise of Moses as in Him most completely accomplished. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require it of him&#8212;The direful consequences of unbelief in Christ, and disregard of His mission, the Jewish people have been experiencing during eighteen hundred years.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> i.e. I will punish him severely for it, as this phrase is taken, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm" title="And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man; at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man.">Genesis 9:5</a> 42:22</span>.
