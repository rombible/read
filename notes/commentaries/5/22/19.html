If a man take a wife, &c.&#8212;The regulations that follow might be imperatively needful in the then situation of the Israelites; and yet, it is not necessary that we should curiously and impertinently inquire into them. So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto the father of the damsel; </span> because this was a reproach to his family, and to himself, because such a miscarriage of his daughter would have been ascribed to his evil education. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He may not put her away all his days; </span> which seems to have been his design in this false accusation, and therefore that liberty of a divorce which is permitted to others, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deu 24:1</a></span>, shall be denied to him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver,....

It is just that he should not be free of his obligations to her, for the motive of his slander had been to get rid of her. But for her it is rough justice. A woman could not divorce a man. By § 142 of Ḫammurabi, if a woman repudiated her husband her past was investigated, and if she had no vice but the husband had belittled her she took her marriage portion and went back to her father’s house.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Laws of Chastity and Marriage. - Higher and still holier than the order of nature stands the moral order of marriage, upon which the well-being not only of domestic life, but also of the civil commonwealth of nations, depends. Marriage must be founded upon fidelity and chastity on the part of those who are married. To foster this, and secure it against outbreaks of malice and evil lust, was the design and object of the laws which follow. The first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a>) relates to the chastity of a woman on entering into the married state, which might be called in question by her husband, either from malice or with justice. The former case is that which Moses treats of first of all. If a man took a wife, and came to her, and hated her, i.e., turned against her after gratifying his carnal desires (like Amnon, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>), and in order to get rid of her again, attributed "deeds or things of words" to her, i.e., things which give occasion for words or talk, and so brought an evil name upon her, saying, that on coming to her he did not find virginity in her. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, virginity, here the signs of it, viz., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-17.htm">Deuteronomy 22:17</a>, the marks of a first intercourse upon the bed-clothes or dress. </body></html>
