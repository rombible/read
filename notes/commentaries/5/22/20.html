If the damsel were an orphan the fine reverted to herself. The fact that the penalties attached to bearing false witness against a wife are fixed and comparatively light indicates the low estimation and position of the woman at that time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-30. If a man take a wife, &c.&#8212;The regulations that follow might be imperatively needful in the then situation of the Israelites; and yet, it is not necessary that we should curiously and impertinently inquire into them. So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if this thing be true,....

Marriage must be founded upon fidelity and chastity on the part of those who are married. To foster this, and secure it against outbreaks of malice and evil lust, was the design and object of the laws which follow. The first (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-13.htm">Deuteronomy 22:13-21</a>) relates to the chastity of a woman on entering into the married state, which might be called in question by her husband, either from malice or with justice. The former case is that which Moses treats of first of all. If a man took a wife, and came to her, and hated her, i.e., turned against her after gratifying his carnal desires (like Amnon, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-15.htm">2 Samuel 13:15</a>), and in order to get rid of her again, attributed "deeds or things of words" to her, i.e., things which give occasion for words or talk, and so brought an evil name upon her, saying, that on coming to her he did not find virginity in her. &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, virginity, here the signs of it, viz., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-17.htm">Deuteronomy 22:17</a>, the marks of a first intercourse upon the bed-clothes or dress. </body></html>
