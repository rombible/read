Jealousy and caprice on the part of the husbands, in view of this law, would be avoided as likely to incur discredit and serious penalties. A fine of 100 shekels (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-19.htm" title="And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and give them to the father of the damsel, because he has brought up an evil name on a virgin of Israel: and she shall be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.">Deuteronomy 22:19</a>), or 50 (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-29.htm" title="Then the man that lay with her shall give to the damsel's father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife; because he has humbled her, he may not put her away all his days.">Deuteronomy 22:29</a>), was no light matter for a nation who found a quarter shekel sufficient for a present to a great man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1Samuel 9:8</a>), and half a shekel too much for a poll-tax on the men of military age (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-3.htm" title="And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not all my lord's servants? why then does my lord require this thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?">1Chronicles 21:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-15.htm" title="The rich shall not give more, and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when they give an offering to the LORD, to make an atonement for your souls.">Exodus 30:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-32.htm" title="Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house of our God;">Nehemiah 10:32</a>). The law of the jealousy offering in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/5-12.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, If any man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,">Numbers 5:12-31</a>, must also be taken into consideration, as guarding the fidelity of the wife. It would be most unadvisable for either man or woman so to act as to bring themselves under the penalties here described. The tendency of these laws would be to make all men watchful and careful for the honour of their families.<p>(21) <span class= "bld">She hath wrought folly in Israel.</span>—This expression should be noticed. It appears for the first time in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-7.htm" title="And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth, because he had worked folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's daughter: which thing ought not to be done.">Genesis 34:7</a>, very shortly after the bestowal of the name <span class= "ital">Israel </span>(Genesis 32). It would almost appear that the name entailed a higher standard of behaviour upon Jacob’s family, after the hand of the Holy One had been laid upon their father. A separate code of rules were binding upon the chosen people from the very beginning of their history. Hardly any point is made of more importance, from the birth of Isaac downwards, than the purity of the chosen seed.<p>(22) <span class= "bld">Adultery.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a>. “<span class= "ital">Moses </span>in the Law commanded us that such should be stoned.” It was not disputed by our Saviour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm" title="Now Moses in the law commanded us, that such should be stoned: but what say you?">John 8:5</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-13.htm" title="If any man take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,">Deuteronomy 22:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">If any man take a wife — </span>And afterward falsely accuse her.

If a man take a wife, &c.&#8212;The regulations that follow might be imperatively needful in the then situation of the Israelites; and yet, it is not necessary that we should curiously and impertinently inquire into them. So far was it from being unworthy of God to leave such things upon record, that the enactments must heighten our admiration of His wisdom and goodness in the management of a people so perverse and so given to irregular passions. Nor is it a better argument that the Scriptures were not written by inspiration of God to object that this passage, and others of a like nature, tend to corrupt the imagination and will be abused by evil-disposed readers, than it is to say that the sun was not created by God, because its light may be abused by wicked men as an assistant in committing crimes which they have meditated [Horne].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Go in unto her, </span> i.e. hath had carnal knowledge of her. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her.

Charges against a Bride. He who, from a base motive, falsely accuses his wife of unchastity before marriage shall after solemn rebuke from the elders be fined 100 silver-pieces and have his right of divorce withdrawn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/22-13.htm" title="If any man take a wife, and go in to her, and hate her,...">Deuteronomy 22:13-19</a>); but if such a charge be true she shall be stoned to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm" title="But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:">Deuteronomy 22:20</a> f.).—No direct address to Israel except in the closing formula which is Sg.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The physical evidence, on which the woman is acquitted, was regarded as essential by many ancient races and is still called for and displayed (not only in judicial cases but after all marriages) by certain tribes in Syria, Egypt and Morocco (see further Driver’s note; Westermarck, <span class="ital">Hist. of Human Marriage</span>, 123 f.); but its absence is by no means conclusive proof of a woman’s previous unchastity, nor is it certain that the original form of this law so regarded it (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm" title="But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel:">Deuteronomy 22:20</a></span>). Musil (<span class="ital">Ethn. Ber.</span> 208 ff.) gives differing instances of the treatment of this case among the fellahin and Arabs. With the former the man at once puts his bride away; if her relatives repay him the bride-price he must be silent; if he speaks and the bride has really been guilty, they kill her; if she is innocent he is killed.

With the Terâbîn, if the man accuses his bride he has to flee before her relatives, and put himself under the protection of a strong man, who opens up communication with them. The bride’s representative applies for a ‘Minshâd’ decision ‘that thereby he may make white my honour which he has blackened,’ which is given only by the representatives of certain clans, to whom each party pays 1000 piasters. If the judge finds the charge false the man pays the father of the bride 100 lira, but if he accepts not the decision he is dishonoured and no one may protect him. If the bride is guilty, her punishment depends on her relatives, and compensation is made to the man, who can however still keep her. The innocent party receive back their 1000 piasters.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>13–30.
