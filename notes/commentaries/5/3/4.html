Professor Porter, in the <span class= "ital">Griant Cities of Bashan, </span>has well described the impression made upon him by verifying this description in detail. “The whole of Bashan,” he says, “is not larger than an ordinary English county.” That “sixty walled cities, ‘besides unwalled towns a great many,’ should exist in a small province, at such a remote age, far from the sea, with no rivers and little commerce, appeared to be inexplicable. Inexplicable, mysterious though it appeared, it was true. On the spot, with my own eyes, I had now verified it. A list of more than <span class= "ital">one hundred </span>ruined cities and villages, situated in these mountains alone, I had in my hands; and on the spot I had tested it, and found it accurate, though not complete.” Many of the cities in the mountains are not ruins. Rooms, doors, bars are entire to this day. The <span class= "ital">region of </span>Argob is distinctly marked out by its natural boundaries, and well described by the same writer.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Og was very powerful, but he did not take warning by the ruin of Sihon, and desire conditions of peace.

Lejah). The name Argob means "stone-heap," and is paraphrased by the Targums, Trachonitis <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a>, or "the rough country;" titles designating the more striking features of the district. Its borders are compared to a rugged shore-line; hence, its description in the text as "the girdle of the stony country," would seem especially appropriate.

Argob was the capital of a district in Bashan of the same name, which, together with other fifty-nine cities in the same province, were conspicuous for their lofty and fortified walls. It was a war of extermination. Houses and cities were razed to the ground; all classes of people were put to the sword; and nothing was saved but the cattle, of which an immense amount fell as spoil into the hands of the conquerors. Thus, the two Amorite kings and the entire population of their dominions were extirpated. The whole country east of the Jordan&#8212;first upland downs from the torrent of the Arnon on the south to that of the Jabbok on the north; next the high mountain tract of Gilead and Bashan from the deep ravine of Jabbok&#8212;became the possession of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Argob; </span> a province within Bashan, or at least subject and belonging to Bashan, as appears from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm" title="And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.">Deu 3:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-13.htm" title="The son of Geber, in Ramothgilead; to him pertained the towns of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead; to him also pertained the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, three score great cities with walls and brazen bars:">1 Kings 4:13</a></span>; called <span class="ital">Argob</span> possibly from the name of a man, its former lord and owner. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And we took all his cities at that time,....

The Heb. for <span class="ital">region</span> means a definitely measured or outlined piece of land, and ’Argob seems connected with <span class="ital">regeb, clod</span>, and analogous to our ‘glebe.’ The Targums take it as Trachonitis or the Trachon of the Greek period, now the Lejá, the mass of lava, 24 miles by 10 to 20, which lies on Ḥauran like an ebony glacier with irregular crevasses. Sharply marked off by its abrupt edge from the surrounding plain it holds considerable means of subsistence, with the ruins of many villages and towns, and might well have been, at this as at other periods, the centre or distinctive feature of a province or kingdom. The identification with ’Argob, accepted by many, is thus not unnatural; nor if we take ’Argob as meaning ‘clumpy’ is this an unsuitable name for the cleft masses of lava, like frozen mud, of which it is composed. But other parts of Ḥauran are also distinct from the rest, e.g. the fertile en-Ṇukra or ‘Hollow Hearth’ of the Arabs; or the almost as fertile W. slope of the Jebel Ḥauran. Both of these bear ruins of ancient towns, while some may be of immemorial antiquity. Nothing however has been discovered either there or throughout Bashan which is recognisable as older than the Greek period.—Euseb. and Jer. give Ragaba as a village near Geresa, in Gile‘ad, cp. Jos. XIII. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xv. 5; and to-day Rajeb or Rujeb is the name of a Wâdy and village also in Gile‘ad. This is noteworthy in view of the fact that one O.T. tradition appears to connect Argob with Gile‘ad; see below.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Threescore cities</span>; probably the same as the Bashan-havoth jair, afterwards mentioned (ver. 14). <span class="cmt_word">The region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</span> The region of Argob comprised the kingdom of Og, and Bashan was another name for the same country; extending from the Jabbok to Hermon, and embracing both the northern part of Gilead, and what was afterwards in a stricter sense Bashan, viz. the land north of the Wady Zerka (<span class="accented">hod</span>. Jebel Ajlan) to Hermon. The name <span class="accented">Argob</span> is supposed by some to be given to the district from a town of that name, fifteen Roman miles eastward from Gerasa, a city of Arabia (Eusebius); but more probably it is derived from <span class="accented">the</span> character of <span class="accented">the district</span>, <span class="accented">either as deep-soiled</span> (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d1;</span>, a clod), or as <span class="accented">rugged</span> and <span class="accented">uneven</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b0;&#x5d2;&#x5d5;&#x5d1;</span>, from <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b7;&#x5d1;</span> akin to <span class="hebrew">&#x5e8;&#x5b8;&#x5d2;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;</span>, to  heap up), just as the neighboring district to the east and northeast received the name <span class="accented">Traohonitis</span> (from <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>, rough, rugged); in the Targum, indeed, <span class="accented">Trachona</span> (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d8;&#x5e8;&#x5db;&#x5d5;&#x5e0;&#x5d0;</span>) is the name given here for Argob. This district is now known as the province of <span class="accented">El-Lejah</span> (The Retreat). It is described as oval in form, about twenty-two miles long by fourteen wide; a plateau elevated about thirty feet above the surrounding plain. Its features are most remarkable. It is composed of a thick stratum of black basalt, which seems to have been emitted in a liquid state from pores in the earth, and to have flowed out on all sides till the whole surface was covered. It is rent and shattered as if by internal convulsion. The cup-like cavities from which the liquid mass was projected are still seen, and also the wavy surface such as a thick liquid generally assumes which cools as it is flowing. There are deep fissures and yawning gulfs with rugged, broken edges; and there are jagged mounds that seem not to have been sufficiently heated to flow, but which were forced up by some mighty agency, and then rent and shattered to their centers. The rock is filled with air-bubbles, and is almost as hard as iron. (Dr. Porter, in Kitto, 'Biblical Cyclopaedia,' 3:1032; see also the same author's 'Five Years in Damascus,' 2:240, etc.; and 'The Giant Cities of Bashan'; Burckhardt, 'Travels in Syria,' p. 110, etc.; Wetstein, 'Reisebericht fib. Hauran,' p. 82, etc.; a paper by Mr. Cyrill Graham in the <span class="accented">Cambridge Essays</span> for 1858; and Smith's 'Dictionary,' art. 'Trachonitis.') The entire trans-Jordanic region was thus captured by the Israelites. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>&#1502;&#1514;&#1501; &#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (city of men) is the town population of men.</body></html>
