Directions to the Two-and-a-Half Tribes and to Joshua<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>At that time Moses charged the two-and-a-half tribes to send their warriors over Jordan till the conquest there was completed, leaving their families and cattle in the cities already given them (18–20). At that time, too, he charged Joshua (21 f.).—To the charge to the two-and-a-half tribes the parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/32-16.htm" title="And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones:...">Numbers 32:16-32</a>, which says that Reuben and Gad (these alone) offered to send their warriors to the W. campaign after building or fortifying cities for their children, and folds for their cattle E. of Jordan; and that Moses enforced this plan with threats of disaster if it was not carried out. Of this composite passage various analyses have been made; all that is clear is that JE narrated some such episode.—To the charge to Joshua, <span class="ital">at that time</span>, the Pent has no parallel. On the ground that it anticipates 28 f. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm" title="And Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for you must go with this people to the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.">Deuteronomy 31:7</a> ff. it is removed by some after <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-28.htm" title="But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see.">Deuteronomy 3:28</a></span>, where indeed it is suitable, but by others has been taken to be no original part of the First Discourse by Moses. Yet the Discourse is not so compact and free of repetition that we need deny to its author such an anticipation of his own words; nor would it be surprising that in the traditions with which he worked there were recorded more than one charge to Joshua or at least several emphases of the fact that Joshua was exhorted by Moses; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm" title="But Joshua the son of Nun, which stands before you, he shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>.
