He trusted his own strength, and so was hardened to his destruction.

The valley of the Arnon is here deep, and the descent to it abrupt. In Roman times it was spanned by a viaduct, the ruins of which still remain, and which was probably built on the lines of the original structure of Mesha <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-5.htm">2 Kings 3:5</a>. Aroer here must not be confounded with "Aroer, which is before Rabbah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. This latter place was "built," "i. e." rebuilt, by the Gadites <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>; it belonged to that tribe, and was consequently far to the north of the Arnon.

Argob was the capital of a district in Bashan of the same name, which, together with other fifty-nine cities in the same province, were conspicuous for their lofty and fortified walls. It was a war of extermination. Houses and cities were razed to the ground; all classes of people were put to the sword; and nothing was saved but the cattle, of which an immense amount fell as spoil into the hands of the conquerors. Thus, the two Amorite kings and the entire population of their dominions were extirpated. The whole country east of the Jordan&#8212;first upland downs from the torrent of the Arnon on the south to that of the Jabbok on the north; next the high mountain tract of Gilead and Bashan from the deep ravine of Jabbok&#8212;became the possession of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Bashan, and all his people,....
