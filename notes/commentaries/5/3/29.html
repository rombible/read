It is a significant finishing touch to the scene described above. This verse also concludes the recapitulation of Israel’s journey from Horeb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-6.htm" title="The LORD our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have dwelled long enough in this mount:">Deuteronomy 1:6</a>) to the banks of Jordan, with which this first discourse of Moses begins. The remainder, contained in Deut.

Thus the aged and experienced in the service of God, should do all they can to strengthen the hands of those who are young, and setting out in religion. Consider what God has done, what God has promised. If God be for us, who can be against us, so as to prevail? We reproach our Leader if we follow him trembling. Moses prayed, that, if it were God's will, he might go before Israel, over Jordan into Canaan. We should never allow any desires in our hearts, which we cannot in faith offer up to God by prayer. God's answer to this prayer had a mixture of mercy and judgment. God sees it good to deny many things we desire. He may accept our prayers, yet not grant us the very things we pray for. It God does not by his providence give us what we desire, yet if by his grace he makes us content without, it comes to much the same. Let it suffice thee to have God for thy Father, and heaven for thy portion, though thou hast not every thing thou wouldst have in the world. God promised Moses a sight of Canaan from the top of Pisgah. Though he should not have the possession of it, he should have the prospect of it. Even great believers, in this present state, see heaven but at a distance. God provided him a successor. It is a comfort to the friends of the church of Christ, to see God's work likely to be carried on by others, when they are silent in the dust. And if we have the earnest and prospect of heaven, let these suffice us; let us submit to the Lord's will, and speak no more to Him of matters which he sees good to refuse us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beth-peor, i. e., the house of Peor, no doubt derived its name from a temple of the Moabite god Peor which was there situated.

Again Euseb. and Jer. describe Beth-phogor as near Mt Phogor opposite Jericho 6 Roman miles above Livias, the mod. Tell er-Rameh, on the Jordan plain. These data suit the identification of <span class="ital">the gai</span> with the W. ‘Uyûn Musa, on the N. of the Nebo or Pisgah headland (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm" title="The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth even to the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdothpisgah eastward.">Deuteronomy 3:17</a></span>). So Dillm., G. A. Smith (<span class="ital">HGHL</span>, 564) and G. B. Gray (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm" title="And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 21:20</a>). Further, Musil (<span class="ital">Moab</span>, 344 f., 348) suggests for the <span class="ital">headland of Pe‘or</span> the headland to the N. of W. ‘Uyûn Musa, and for Beth-Pe‘or the ruins and shrine esh-Sheikh Jâyel on one of the steps of that headland, ‘thence one gets the best view of the lower slopes and of the Jordan valley.’ The stream of the wady between these two headlands, before it reaches the Dead Sea, passes the ruins es-Sueimeh, in which there is a possible echo of Yeshimon, and Yeshimôth; and the bare district about this lies in full view of both headlands. There is, therefore, no need to read Pisgah for Pe‘or in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-28.htm" title="And Balak brought Balaam to the top of Peor, that looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 23:28</a> on the basis of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-20.htm" title="And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks toward Jeshimon.">Numbers 21:20</a>. On the whole the above identification of <span class="ital">the Gai</span> with the W. ‘Uyun Musa is preferable to that with the next wâdy to the N., the W. Hesbân (Driver). Conder’s proposal for Beth-Pe‘or (<span class="ital">Heth and Moab</span>, 146), the headland by ‘Ain el Minyeh, would remove <span class="ital">the Gai</span> too far south.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">In the valley over against Beth-peor</span>; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. in the plains of Moab (Arboth Moab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/22-1.htm">Numbers 22:1</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-46.htm">Deuteronomy 4:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-6.htm">Deuteronomy 34:6</a>).

This prayer is not mentioned in the historical account given in the fourth book; but it must have preceded the prayer for the appointment of a shepherd over the congregation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-16.htm">Numbers 27:16</a>, as the Lord directs him in His reply (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-28.htm">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>) to appoint Joshua as the leader of the people. In his prayer, Moses appealed to the manifestations of divine grace which he had already received. As the Lord had already begun to show him His greatness and His mighty hand, so might He also show him the completion of His work. The expression, "begun to show Thy greatness," relates not so much to the mighty acts of the Lord in Egypt and at the Red Sea (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-13.htm">Numbers 14:13</a>.), as to the manifestation of the divine omnipotence in the defeat of the Amorites, by which the Lord had begun to bring His people into the possession of the promised land, and had made Himself known as God, to whom there was no equal in heaven or on earth. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; before &#1488;&#1500; &#1502;&#1497; (v. 24) is an explanatory and causal relative: because (quod, quia), or for. "For what God is there in heaven and on earth," etc. These words recall <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>, and are echoed in many of the Psalms, - in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/86-8.htm">Psalm 86:8</a> almost verbatim. The contrast drawn between Jehovah and other gods does not involve the reality of the heathen deities, but simply presupposes a belief in the existence of other gods, without deciding as to the truth of that belief. &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, manifestations of &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, mighty deeds.</body></html>
