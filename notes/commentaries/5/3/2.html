The valley of the Arnon is here deep, and the descent to it abrupt. In Roman times it was spanned by a viaduct, the ruins of which still remain, and which was probably built on the lines of the original structure of Mesha <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-5.htm">2 Kings 3:5</a>. Aroer here must not be confounded with "Aroer, which is before Rabbah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>. This latter place was "built," "i. e." rebuilt, by the Gadites <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm">Numbers 32:34</a>; it belonged to that tribe, and was consequently far to the north of the Arnon.
