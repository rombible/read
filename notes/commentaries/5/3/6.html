Argob was the capital of a district in Bashan of the same name, which, together with other fifty-nine cities in the same province, were conspicuous for their lofty and fortified walls. It was a war of extermination. Houses and cities were razed to the ground; all classes of people were put to the sword; and nothing was saved but the cattle, of which an immense amount fell as spoil into the hands of the conquerors. Thus, the two Amorite kings and the entire population of their dominions were extirpated. The whole country east of the Jordan&#8212;first upland downs from the torrent of the Arnon on the south to that of the Jabbok on the north; next the high mountain tract of Gilead and Bashan from the deep ravine of Jabbok&#8212;became the possession of the Israelites.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And we utterly destroyed them,....

The statement, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-25.htm">Joshua 13:25</a>, that the half of the country of the Ammonites was given to the tribe of Gad, is not at variance with this; for the allusion there is to that portion of the land of the Ammonites which was between the Arnon and the Jabbok, and which had already been taken from the Ammonites by the Amorites under Sihon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm">Judges 11:13</a>.). </body></html>
