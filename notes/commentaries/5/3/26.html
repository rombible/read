Moses, like Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/24-15.htm" title="At his day you shall give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down on it; for he is poor, and sets his heart on it: lest he cry against you to the LORD, and it be sin to you.">Deuteronomy 24:15-22</a>), was made a sign.<p>(26) <span class= "bld">Let it suffice thee.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">enough for thee, </span>or, as it is paraphrased by Rashi from older commontatore, “Far more than this is reserved for thee; plentiful goodness is hidden for thee.” And so indeed it proved. For on some “goodly mountain” (Hermon or “Lebanon,”) Moses and Elias stood with the Saviour of the world, and spake of a far more glorious conquest than Joshua’s, even “His exodus, which He should fulfil at Jerusalem” (St. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-31.htm" title="Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.">Luke 9:31</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:21-29 Moses encouraged Joshua, who was to succeed him. Thus the aged and experienced in the service of God, should do all they can to strengthen the hands of those who are young, and setting out in religion. Consider what God has done, what God has promised. If God be for us, who can be against us, so as to prevail? We reproach our Leader if we follow him trembling. Moses prayed, that, if it were God's will, he might go before Israel, over Jordan into Canaan. We should never allow any desires in our hearts, which we cannot in faith offer up to God by prayer. God's answer to this prayer had a mixture of mercy and judgment. God sees it good to deny many things we desire. He may accept our prayers, yet not grant us the very things we pray for. It God does not by his providence give us what we desire, yet if by his grace he makes us content without, it comes to much the same. Let it suffice thee to have God for thy Father, and heaven for thy portion, though thou hast not every thing thou wouldst have in the world. God promised Moses a sight of Canaan from the top of Pisgah. Though he should not have the possession of it, he should have the prospect of it. Even great believers, in this present state, see heaven but at a distance. God provided him a successor. It is a comfort to the friends of the church of Christ, to see God's work likely to be carried on by others, when they are silent in the dust. And if we have the earnest and prospect of heaven, let these suffice us; let us submit to the Lord's will, and speak no more to Him of matters which he sees good to refuse us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord was wroth with me for your sakes - Here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-37.htm">Deuteronomy 1:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-21.htm">Deuteronomy 4:21</a>; the sin of the people is stated to be the ground on which Moses' prayer is denied.
