The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul.

There is this difference, however, between the two blessings, that in that of the patriarch it is the growth of the tribe in power and might that is chiefly contemplated; whilst in that of Moses it is the advance of the tribe in wealth, prosperity, and influence that is chiefly indicated. "Jacob described the growth of Joseph under the figure of a luxuriant branch of a fruit tree planted by the water; whilst Moses fixes his eye primarily upon the land of Joseph, and desires for him the richest productions" (Keil). <span class="cmt_word">For the precious things of heaven, for the dew</span>.

Probably, however, this is only a correction, to bring this passage into accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-25.htm">Genesis 49:25</a>. The Targums and the Peshito combine both readings. Instead of "<span class="accented">for</span> the precious things," it is better to read "with," etc., and so throughout vers. 13-16. Literally, it is <span class="accented">from</span>, etc.; <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5de;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, the <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;</span> expressing the instrumental cause of the blessing, of which the Lord is the efficient cause. The noun <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b6;&#x5d2;&#x5b6;&#x5d3;</span>, literally, <span class="accented">excellency</span>, <span class="accented">preciousness</span>, occurs only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-13.htm">Song of Solomon 4:13, 16</a> and Cant 7:13, where it is rendered by "pleasant." The precious fruit of the heavens is the dew, which, with the waters stored up in the recesses of the earth, furthers the growth of the earth's produce, ripened by the influences of sun and moon. <span class="cmt_word">And for the chief things of the ancient mountains</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and from the head of the mountains of old</span>.

The oxen are Joseph's sons, all of whom were strong, but the firstborn excelled the rest, and was endowed with majesty. It is Ephraim that is referred to, whom Jacob raised to the position of the firstborn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-8.htm">Genesis 48:8</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">His horns are like the horns of unicorns</span>; literally, <span class="accented">and horns of a ream are his horns</span>.

Judah, from whom the sceptre was not to depart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>), is mentioned before Levi as the royal tribe. The prayer, May Jehovah bring Judah to his people, can hardly be understood in any other way than it is by Onkelos and Hengstenberg (Christol. i. 80), viz., as founded upon the blessing of Jacob, and expressing the desire, that as Judah was to lead the way as the champion of his brethren in the wars of Israel against the nations, he might have a prosperous return to his people; for the thought, "introduce him to the kingdom of Israel and Judah" (Luther), or "give up to him the people which belongs to him according to Thine appointment" (Schultz), is hardly implied in the words, "bring to his people." Other explanations are not worth mentioning. What follows points to strife and war: "With his hands (&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493; accusative of the instrument, vid., Ges. &#1431;138, 1, note 3; Ewald, &#1431;283, a.) is he fighting (&#1512;&#1489; participle of &#1512;&#1497;&#1489;) for it (the nation); Thou wilt grant him help, deliverance before his foes." </body></html>
