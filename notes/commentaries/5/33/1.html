He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The title "the man of God" in the Old Testament is one who is favored with direct revelations, but not necessarily an official prophet.

The Mutilated shall not Enter the Congregation. The reason is either the general one, which may well have been primitive, that a blemished man was ritually unfit for a community, formed like all ancient communities on a religious basis (cp. H, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-20.htm" title="Or hunch back, or a dwarf, or that has a blemish in his eye, or be scurvy, or scabbed, or has his stones broken;">Leviticus 21:20</a>, for the priests alone); or the particular one that such unsexed persons often served heathen deities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-17.htm" title="There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a sodomite of the sons of Israel.">Deuteronomy 23:17</a> f. (18 f.)). Also the employment of eunuchs was part of the foreign <span class="ital">ḥareem</span> system introduced by Solomon. There is therefore no reason to doubt the possibility of an early date for this law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On its use of <span class="ital">ḳahal</span> for the congregation of Israel see below. Berth. argues that the rigorous exclusion of eunuchs implies a date later than the exilic or post-exilic passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-3.htm" title="Neither let the son of the stranger, that has joined himself to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD has utterly separated me from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry tree.">Isaiah 56:3</a> ff., which promises the childless eunuch, <span class="ital">sarîs</span>, a lasting name in Israel, better than sons or daughters, if he keeps Jehovah’s covenant. But this promise, in its connection with a similar one to the son of the foreigner, reads as the grant, under the influence of a more spiritual and generous piety (cp. on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm" title="Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.">Deuteronomy 33:6</a></span>), of privileges hitherto denied to the physical eunuch by custom or law. Or has <span class="ital">sarîs</span> here the same symbolic meaning which it bears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>? Nor does Berth.’s appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-19.htm" title="The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, which passed between the parts of the calf;">Jeremiah 34:19</a> carry weight, for the <span class="ital">sarîsîm</span> mentioned there can hardly, because of their ranking with princes and priests, be physical eunuchs but are rather chamberlains or other high officials. Jensen derives the word from Ass. <span class="ital">sha reshi</span> ‘he who is chief’ (<span class="ital">Z.

The earlier instances of the term cited there shew that its use here cannot be taken as proof of an exilic or post-exilic date. This in answer to Berth.

This explains the name Hoshea, instead of Jehoshuah (Joshua), which Moses had given to his servant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/13-8.htm">Numbers 13:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm">Numbers 13:16</a>), and invariably uses (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-3.htm">Deuteronomy 31:3</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-14.htm">Deuteronomy 31:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-23.htm">Deuteronomy 31:23</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-21.htm">Deuteronomy 3:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-28.htm">Deuteronomy 3:28</a>, and the exposition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-16.htm">Numbers 13:16</a>). - On <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-46.htm">Deuteronomy 32:46</a>, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-7.htm">Deuteronomy 6:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-19.htm">Deuteronomy 11:19</a>; and on <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-47.htm">Deuteronomy 32:47</a>, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>. </body></html>
