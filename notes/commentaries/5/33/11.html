The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Smite through the loins - Rather, strike the loins, i. e., the seat of their strength. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10. of Levi he said&#8212;The burden of this blessing is the appointment of the Levites to the dignified and sacred office of the priesthood (Le 10:11; De 22:8; 17:8-11), a reward for their zeal in supporting the cause of God, and their unsparing severity in chastising even their nearest and dearest relatives who had participated in the idolatry of the molten calf (Ex 32:25-28; compare Mal 2:4-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His substance, </span> i.e. his outward estate, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-18.htm" title="But you shall remember the LORD your God: for it is he that gives you power to get wealth, that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as it is this day.">Deu 8:18</a></span>, because he hath no inheritance of his own, and therefore wholly depends upon thy blessing.

And He became King in righteous-nation (Jeshurun); there the heads of the people assembled, in crowds the tribes of Israel." The God who met Israel at Sinai in terrible majesty, out of the myriads of holy angels, who embraces all nations in love, and has all the holy angels in His power, so that they lie at His feet and rise up at His word, gave the law through Moses to the congregation of Jacob as a precious possession, and became King in Israel. This was the object of the glorious manifestation of His holy majesty upon Sinai. Instead of saying, "He gave the law to the tribes of Israel through my mediation," Moses personates the listening nation, and not only speaks of himself in the third person, but does so by identifying his own person with the nation, because he wished the people to repeat his words from thorough conviction, and because the law which he gave in the name of the Lord was given to himself as well, and was as binding upon him as upon every other member of the congregation. In a similar manner the prophet Habakkuk identifies himself with the nation in ch. 3, and says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a>, out of the heart of the nation, "The Lord is my strength,...who maketh me to walk upon mine high places," - an expression which did not apply to himself, but to the nation as a whole. So again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/20-1.htm">Psalm 20:1-9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/21-1.htm">Psalm 21:1-13</a>, which David composed as the prayers of the nation for its king, he not only speaks of himself as the anointed of the Lord, but addresses such prayers to the Lord for himself as could only be offered by the nation for its king. "A possession for the congregation of Jacob." "Israel was distinguished above all other nations by the possession of the divinely revealed law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5-8</a>); that was its most glorious possession, and therefore is called its true &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;" (Knobel). The subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a> is not Moses but Jehovah, who became King in Jeshurun (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-18.htm">Exodus 15:18</a>).
