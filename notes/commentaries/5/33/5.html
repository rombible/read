He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>He was king - i. e., not Moses but the Lord became king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-4. The Lord came&#8212;Under a beautiful metaphor, borrowed from the dawn and progressive splendor of the sun, the Majesty of God is sublimely described as a divine light which appeared in Sinai and scattered its beams on all the adjoining region in directing Israel's march to Canaan. In these descriptions of a theophania, God is represented as coming from the south, and the allusion is in general to the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai; but other mountains in the same direction are mentioned with it. The location of Seir was on the east of the Ghor; mount Paran was either the chain on the west of the Ghor, or rather the mountains on the southern border of the desert towards the peninsula [Robinson]. (Compare Jud 5:4, 5; Ps 68:7, 8; Hab 3:3).<p>ten thousands of saints&#8212;rendered by some, "with the ten thousand of Kadesh," or perhaps better still, "from Meribah" [Ewald].<p>a fiery law&#8212;so called both because of the thunder and lightning which accompanied its promulgation (Ex 19:16-18; De 4:11), and the fierce, unrelenting curse denounced against the violation of its precepts (2Co 3:7-9). Notwithstanding those awe-inspiring symbols of Majesty that were displayed on Sinai, the law was really given in kindness and love (De 33:3), as a means of promoting both the temporal and eternal welfare of the people. And it was "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," not only from the hereditary obligation under which that people were laid to observe it, but from its being the grand distinction, the peculiar privilege of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Moses was their king, not in title, but in reality, being under God their supreme and uncontrollable governor and lawgiver: though the word oft signifies only a <span class="ital">prince</span> or <span class="ital">chief ruler</span>, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of Bethlehemjudah.">Judges 19:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-3.htm" title="And say, Hear you the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus said the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil on this place, the which whoever hears, his ears shall tingle.">Jeremiah 19:3</a> 46:25</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Jeshurun, </span> i.e. in Israel, so called <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deu 32:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When the heads of the people and the tribes of Israel were gathered together:</span> when the princes and people met together for the management of public affairs, Moses was owned by them as their king and lawgiver, and he directed and ruled them as their superior.

In form, this repetition differs from the previous announcement, partly in the fact that the situation of Mount Nebo is more fully described (in the land of Moab, etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-1.htm">Deuteronomy 29:1</a>), and partly in the continual use of the imperative, and a few other trifling points. These differences may all be explained from the fact that the account here was not written by Moses himself. </body></html>
