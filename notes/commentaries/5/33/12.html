Beloved of Jehovah!<p>He (Jehovah) will dwell in security upon him,<p>Covering him over all the day.<p>And between his shoulders (mountain slopes) He<p>hath taken up His abode.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/deuteronomy/33.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Deuteronomy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ISRAEL THE BELOVED<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm" title="And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.">Deuteronomy 33:12</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Benjamin was his father’s favourite child, and the imagery of this promise is throughout drawn from the relations between such a child and its father. So far as the future history of the tribes is shadowed in these ‘blessings’ of this great ode, the reference of the text may be to the tribe of Benjamin, as specially distinguished by Saul having been a member of it, and by the Temple having been built on its soil. But we find that each of the promises of the text is repeated elsewhere, with distinct reference to the whole nation. For example, the first one, of safe dwelling, reappears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-28.htm" title="Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob shall be on a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall drop down dew.">Deuteronomy 33:28</a> in reference to Israel; the second one, of God’s protecting covering, is extended to the nation in many places; and the third, of dwelling between His shoulders, is in substance found again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, ‘the Lord thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son.’ So that we may give the text a wider extension, and take it as setting forth under a lovely metaphor, and with a restricted reference, what is true of all God’s children everywhere and always.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Who are the ‘beloved of the Lord’?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The first answer to that question must be-all men. But these great blessings, so beautifully shadowed in this text, do not belong to all men; nor does the designation, ‘the beloved of the Lord,’ belong to all men, but to those who have entered into a special relation to Him. In these words of the Hebrew singer there sound the first faint tones of a music that was to swell into clear notes, when Jesus said: ‘If a man love Me, he will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come unto him, and make Our abode with him.’ They who are knit by faith and love to God’s only-begotten and beloved Son, by that union receive ‘power to become the sons of God,’ and share in the love which is ever pouring out from the Father’s heart on ‘the Son of His love.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. What are their blessed privileges?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The three clauses of the text express substantially the same idea, but with a striking variety of metaphors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 1. They have a sure dwelling-place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> There is a very slight change of rendering of the first clause, which greatly increases its ‘force, and preserves the figure that is obscured by the usual translation. We should read ‘shall dwell safely <span class="ital">on</span>,’ rather than ‘<span class="ital">by</span>, Him.’ And the effect of that small change in the preposition is to bring out the thought that God is regarded as the foundation on which His beloved build their house of life, and dwell in security and calm. If we are sons through the Son, we shall build our houses or pitch our tents on that firm ground, and, being founded on the Rock of ages, they will not fall when all created foundations reel to the overthrow of whatever is built on <span class="ital">them</span>. It is not companionship only, blessed as that is, that is promised here. We have a larger privilege than dwelling <span class="ital">by</span> Him, for if we love His Son, we build <span class="ital">on</span> God, and ‘God dwelleth in us and we in Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> What spiritual reality underlies the metaphor of dwelling or building on God? The fact of habitual communion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Note the blessed results of such grounding of our lives on God through such habitual communion. We shall ‘dwell safely.’ We may think of that as being objective safety-that is, freedom from peril, or as being subjective-that is, freedom from care or fear, or as meaning ‘trustfully,’ confidently, as the expression is rendered in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-9.htm" title="Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoices: my flesh also shall rest in hope.">Psalm 16:9</a> {margin}, which is for us the ground of both these. He who dwells in God trustfully dwells both safely and securely, and none else is free either from danger or from dread.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 2. They have a sure shelter.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> God is for His beloved not only the foundation on which they dwell in safety, but their perpetual covering. They dwell safely because He is so. There are many tender shapes in which this great promise is presented to our faith. Sometimes God is thought of as covering the weak fugitive, as the arching sides of His cave sheltered David from Saul. Sometimes He is represented as covering His beloved, who cower under His wings, ‘as the hen gathereth her chickens’ when hawks are in the sky. Sometimes He appears as covering them from tempest, ‘when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm against the wall,’ and ‘the shadow of a great rock’ shields from its fury. Sometimes He is pictured as stretching out protection over His beloved’s heads, as the Pillar of cloud lay, long-drawn-out, over the Tabernacle when at rest, and ‘on all the Glory was a defence.’ But under whatever emblem the general idea of a covering shelter was conceived, there was always a correlative duty on our side. For the root-meaning of one of the Old Testament words for ‘faith’ is ‘fleeing to a refuge,’ and we shall not be safe in God unless by faith we flee for refuge to Him in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> 3. They have a Father who bears them on His shoulders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The image is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm" title="These be the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.">Deuteronomy 1:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-46.htm" title="So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed there.">Deuteronomy 1:46</a> already referred to. It recurs also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-3.htm" title="Listen to me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb:">Isaiah 46:3</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-4.htm" title="And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry, and will deliver you.">Isaiah 46:4</a>, ‘Even to hoar hairs will I carry you, and I have made and I will bear, yea, I will carry, and will deliver’; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-3.htm" title="I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.">Hosea 11:3</a>, ‘I taught Ephraim to go; I took them on My arms.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The image beautifully suggests the thought of the favourite child riding high and happy on the strong shoulder, which lifts it above rough places and miry ways. The prose reality is: ‘My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The Cross carries those who carry it. They who carry God in their hearts are carried by God through all the long pilgrimage of life. Because they are thus upheld by a strength not their own, ‘they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint,’ and though marches be long and limbs strained, they shall ‘go from strength to strength till every one of them appears before God in Zion.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm" title="And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.">Deuteronomy 33:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">Of Benjamin — </span>Benjamin is put next to Levi, because the temple, where the work of the Levites lay, was upon the edge of the lot of this tribe.

The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul.

"To dwell upon God, and between his shoulders, means as much as to lean upon him; the similitude being taken from fathers who carry their sons while yet small and tender" (Calvin). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The blessings upon the tribes commence with this verse. "Let Reuben live and not die, and there be a (small) number of his men." The rights of the first-born had been withheld from Reuben in the blessing of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>); Moses, however, promises this tribe continuance and prosperity. The words, "and let his men become a number," have been explained in very different ways. &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; in this connection cannot mean a large number (&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837;, lxx), but, like &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-30.htm">Genesis 34:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-28.htm">Jeremiah 44:28</a>), simply a small number, that could easily be counted (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-62.htm">Deuteronomy 28:62</a>). The negation must be carried on to the last clause. This the language will allow, as the rule that a negation can only be carried forward when it stands with emphatic force at the very beginning (Ewald, 351) is not without exceptions; see for example <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-2.htm">Proverbs 30:2-3</a>, where three negative clauses follow a positive one, and in the last the &#1500;&#1488; is omitted, without the particle of negation having been placed in any significant manner at the beginning. - Simeon was the next in age to Reuben; but he is passed over entirely, because according to Jacob's blessing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>) he was to be scattered abroad in Israel, and lost his individuality as a tribe in consequence of this dispersion, in accordance with which the Simeonites simply received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), and, "having no peculiar object of its own, took part, as far as possible, in the fate and objects of the other tribes, more especially of Judah" (Schultz). Although, therefore, it is by no means to be regarded as left without a blessing, but rather as included in the general blessings in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-29.htm">Deuteronomy 33:29</a>, and still more in the blessing upon Judah, yet it could not receive a special blessing like the tribe of Reuben, because, as Ephraim Syrus observes, the Simeonites had not endeavoured to wipe out the stain of the crime which Jacob cursed, but had added to it by fresh crimes (more especially the audacious prostitution of Zimri, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25.htm">Numbers 25</a>). Even the Simeonites did not become extinct, but continued to live in the midst of the tribe of Judah, so that as late as the eighth century, in the reign of Hezekiah, thirteen princes are enumerated with their families, whose fathers' houses had increased greatly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-34.htm">1 Chronicles 4:34</a>.); and these families effected conquests in the south, even penetrating into the mountains of Seir, for the purpose of seeking fresh pasture (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-39.htm">1 Chronicles 4:39-43</a>). Hence the assertion that the omission of Simeon is only conceivable from the circumstances of a later age, is as mistaken as the attempt made in some of the MSS of the Septuagint to interpolate the name of Simeon in the second clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-6.htm">Deuteronomy 33:6</a>. </body></html>
