Upon “He was king in Jeshurun,” Rashi says, “The Holy One, blessed be He! the yoke of His kingdom is upon them for ever.” It may be so. “When the Lord your God was your king,” is Samuel’s description of the whole history of Israel previous to himself.<p>The certainty that the King of kings, the Messiah of Israel, was and is the Lawgiver and Teacher, and Keeper of all saints, and that there are none of that character who do not “sit at the feet of Jesus,” makes the real meaning of the passage perfectly plain, even though the exact grammatical relation of the clauses may be not beyond dispute.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm" title="Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob.">Deuteronomy 33:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moses commanded us a law — </span>Moses has been thought by some to speak this of himself, in the third person, because he intended the contents of this chapter, like the preceding song, to be learned by the Israelites, and repealed in their own persons.

He begins with a description of the glorious appearances of God, in giving the law. His law works like fire. If received, it is melting, warming, purifying, and burns up the dross of corruption; if rejected, it hardens, sears, pains, and destroys. The Holy Spirit came down in cloven tongues, as of fire; for the gospel also is a fiery law. The law of God written in the heart, is a certain proof of the love of God shed abroad there: we must reckon His law one of the gifts of his grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"The people" are the twelve tribes, not the Gentiles; and his saints refer to God's chosen people just before spoken of.

The Lord came&#8212;Under a beautiful metaphor, borrowed from the dawn and progressive splendor of the sun, the Majesty of God is sublimely described as a divine light which appeared in Sinai and scattered its beams on all the adjoining region in directing Israel's march to Canaan. In these descriptions of a theophania, God is represented as coming from the south, and the allusion is in general to the thunderings and lightnings of Sinai; but other mountains in the same direction are mentioned with it. The location of Seir was on the east of the Ghor; mount Paran was either the chain on the west of the Ghor, or rather the mountains on the southern border of the desert towards the peninsula [Robinson]. (Compare Jud 5:4, 5; Ps 68:7, 8; Hab 3:3).<p>ten thousands of saints&#8212;rendered by some, "with the ten thousand of Kadesh," or perhaps better still, "from Meribah" [Ewald].<p>a fiery law&#8212;so called both because of the thunder and lightning which accompanied its promulgation (Ex 19:16-18; De 4:11), and the fierce, unrelenting curse denounced against the violation of its precepts (2Co 3:7-9). Notwithstanding those awe-inspiring symbols of Majesty that were displayed on Sinai, the law was really given in kindness and love (De 33:3), as a means of promoting both the temporal and eternal welfare of the people. And it was "the inheritance of the congregation of Jacob," not only from the hereditary obligation under which that people were laid to observe it, but from its being the grand distinction, the peculiar privilege of the nation.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Moses speaks this of himself in the third person, which is very usual in the Hebrew language.

These differences may all be explained from the fact that the account here was not written by Moses himself. </body></html>
