The <span class= "ital">character of the priest </span>is the principal subject. The blessing may be thus paraphrased: “Let thy Thummim and thy Urim (the chief high-priestly ornaments) be ever with some saintly man of thine, like him whom thou (Israel) didst tempt in Massah, and with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Meribah (Moses’ own departed brother Aaron is alluded to, for the people murmured against them both in both places), like him (Eleazar or Phinehas) who said to his father and to his mother, ‘I have not seen him,’ &c. These are the priests that shall teach Jacob thy judgments and Israel thy law.” The conduct of the tribe of Levi at Sinai is alluded to, when they stood by Moses and slew the idolaters. Who headed them on that occasion we are not told. Eleazar or Phinehas may be intended. The conduct of Phinehas (in Numbers 25) is also a case in point. As Rashi observes, “his father and his mother, his brethren and children” cannot be taken literally, because the tribe of Levi on the whole was faithful. The fathers, mothers, brethren, and children chiefly belonged to the other tribes.<p><span class= "bld">Let thy Thummim and thy Urim.</span>—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a>. “<span class= "ital">Thy </span>Thummim and <span class= "ital">thy </span>Urim” may refer to Israel, or to Levi, or to Jehovah Himself. In the last case, He must be thought to have <span class= "ital">tried </span>Levi at Massah, and striven with Moses and Aaron at the waters of Meribah. It is not at all easy to distribute the pronouns with certainty in this speech.<p>If the writer of Deuteronomy was unconscious of any difference between priest and Levite, how is the mention of Urim and Thummim to be explained?<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-8.htm" title="And of Levi he said, Let your Thummim and your Urim be with your holy one, whom you did prove at Massah, and with whom you did strive at the waters of Meribah;">Deuteronomy 33:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Of Levi he said — </span>Said to God in prayer. <span class="ital">Let thy Thummim, </span>&c. — That is, the Thummim and Urim which are thine, O Lord, by special institution and consecration, (understanding thereby the ephod, in which they were put, the high-priesthood to which they were appropriated, and withal the gifts and graces signified by them, and necessary for the discharge of that high office,) <span class="ital">be with thy holy one — </span>That is, with that priest whom thou hast consecrated to thyself, and who is holy in a more peculiar manner than the people are. He means let the family of Aaron perpetually retain the priesthood, and be endued with that uprightness in the discharge of their duty and that light and knowledge in divine things which are signified by the Thummim and Urim. Notwithstanding this blessing, the Urim and Thummim were lost in the captivity, and never restored under the second temple. But they have their full accomplishment in Jesus Christ, God’s Holy One, and our great High-Priest, of whom Aaron was but a type. With him, who had lain in the Father’s bosom from eternity, the Urim and Thummim shall ever remain, for he is the wonderful and everlasting Counsellor. <span class="ital">Whom thou didst prove at Massah — </span>That is, try and rebuke, but yet didst not take away the priesthood from him. <span class="ital">With whom thou didst strive — </span>Whom thou didst reprove and chastise.

The blessing of Judah may refer to the whole tribe in general, or to David as a type of Christ. Moses largely blesses the tribe of Levi. Acceptance with God is what we should all aim at, and desire, in all our devotions, whether men accept us or not, 2Co 5:9. This prayer is a prophecy, that God will keep up a ministry in his church to the end of time. The tribe of Benjamin had their inheritance close to mount Zion. To be situated near the ordinances, is a precious gift from the Lord, a privilege not to be exchanged for any worldly advantage, or indulgence. We should thankfully receive the earthly blessings sent to us, through the successive seasons. But those good gifts which come down from the Father of lights, through the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and the pouring out of his Spirit like the rain which makes fruitful, are infinitely more precious, as the tokens of his special love. The precious things here prayed for, are figures of spiritual blessing in heavenly things by Christ, the gifts, graces, and comforts of the Spirit. When Moses prays for the good will of Him that dwelt in the bush, he refers to the covenant, on which all our hopes of God's favour must be founded. The providence of God appoints men's habitations, and wisely disposes men to different employments for the public good. Whatever our place and business are, it is our wisdom and duty to apply thereto; and it is happiness to be well pleased therewith. We should not only invite others to the service of God, but abound in it. The blessing of Naphtali. The favour of God is the only favour satisfying to the soul. Those are happy indeed, who have the favour of God; and those shall have it, who reckon that in having it they have enough, and desire no more.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy holy one - i. e., Levi, regarded as the representative of the whole priestly and Levitical stock which sprang from him. The contrast between the tone of this passage and that of <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-5.htm">Genesis 49:5-7</a> is remarkable. Though the prediction of Jacob respecting the dispersion of this tribe held good, yet it was so overruled as to issue in honor and reward. The recovery of God's favor is to be traced to the faithfulness with which Moses and Aaron, who came of this tribe, served God in their high offices; and to the zeal and constancy which conspicuous persons of the tribe (e. g. Phinehas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-11.htm">Numbers 25:11</a> ff), and the whole tribe itself (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26</a>), manifested on critical occasions in supporting the leaders of the people. The same reasons led to Levi's being selected for the special service of God in the sanctuary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a> ff, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5</a> ff); and for the office of instructing their brethren in the knowledge of the Law. The events at Massah and Meribah, the one occurring at the beginning, the other toward the end, of the forty years' wandering, serve to represent the whole series of trials by which God proved and exercised the faith and obedience of this chosen tribe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8-10. of Levi he said&#8212;The burden of this blessing is the appointment of the Levites to the dignified and sacred office of the priesthood (Le 10:11; De 22:8; 17:8-11), a reward for their zeal in supporting the cause of God, and their unsparing severity in chastising even their nearest and dearest relatives who had participated in the idolatry of the molten calf (Ex 32:25-28; compare Mal 2:4-6).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy holy one; </span><span class="ital"> the Thummim and the Urim</span>, which are <span class="ital">thine</span>, O Lord, by special institution and consecration; by which he understands the ephod, in which they were put, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm" title="And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim; and they shall be on Aaron's heart, when he goes in before the LORD: and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his heart before the LORD continually.">Exodus 28:30</a></span>, by a synecdoche, and the high priesthood, to which they were appropriated, by a metonymy; and withal the gifts and graces signified by the <span class="ital">Urim and Thummim</span>, and necessary for the discharge of that high office, shall be with thy holy one, i.e. with that Levite, that priest, which thou hast consecrated to thyself, and which is holy in a more peculiar manner than all the people were, i.e. the priesthood shall be confined to and continued in Aaron’s family. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whom thou didst prove</span>: this seems added by way of anticipation; although thou didst try him, and rebuke him, and shut him out of Canaan for his miscarriage about fetching water out of the rock, yet thou didst not therefore take away the priesthood from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">At Massah</span>; not at that <span class="ital">Massah</span> mentioned <span class="bld"> Exo 17</span>, which is also called <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Meribah, </span> where neither Moses nor Aaron are reproved, nor is Aaron so much as named, but at that other <span class="ital">Meribah</span>, <span class="bld"> Num 20</span>, where this is expressed, which as it is called by one of the names of that place, <span class="bld"> Exo 17</span>, to wit, <span class="ital">Meribah</span>, <span class="bld"> Num 20</span>, so it may be here called by its other name, <span class="ital">Massah</span>; and well may the same names be given to those two places, because the occasion of them was in a great measure one and the same.

Calvin seeks to remove this by regarding our couplet as ‘added by way of exception … Moses magnifies God’s mercy by this allusion in that He dignified Aaron with so great an honour, notwithstanding his having been overcome with impatience and fallen’; and he quotes the analogy of Christ’s call to Peter to feed His sheep after Peter had thrice denied Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/21-15.htm" title="So when they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, love you me more than these?

In Jacob's blessing, Simeon is joined with Levi, but Moses passes him over altogether, probably because, as Jacob foretold, he was to be scattered among his brethren (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-7.htm">Genesis 49:7</a>), and so lose his tribal individuality. Simeon, however, is included in the general blessing pronounced on Israel; and as this tribe received a number of towns within the territory of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/19-2.htm">Joshua 19:2-9</a>), it was probably regarded as included in the blessing on that tribe. <span class="cmt_word">Thy Thummim and thy Urim</span>; <span class="accented">thy Right and thy Light</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-30.htm">Exodus 28:30</a>). The high priest wore the breast-plate on which these were placed when he went in before the Lord; and this is here represented as the prerogative of the whole tribe. Thy holy one; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. Levi, the tribe-father, representing the whole tribe to which the blessing applies; hence in the following verses the verb passes into the plural. For "holy one," it would be better to read "pious" or "godly one;" literally, <span class="accented">the man thy pious one</span>. Some would render "the man thy favored one," or "the man of thy friendship;" but this is wholly arbitrary, the word (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5e1;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;</span>) has no such meaning. To explain this more particularly, reference is made to the trials at <span class="cmt_word">Massah</span> <span class="cmt_word">and the waters of Meribah</span> (strife), when the people rebelled and murmured against Moses and Aaron, whereby the piety of these men was put to the test, and in them, the heads of the tribe of Levi, the whole tribe was proved. (On Massah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>; and on the waters of strife, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1-13</a>.) In these trials, Levi had proved himself faithful and godly, having risen up in defense of the honor of Jehovah, and in support of his covenant, though in the latter case both Moses and Aaron stumbled. <span class="cmt_word">Who said unto his father and to his mother</span>, etc. This refers to what is narrated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-26.htm">Exodus 32:26-29</a>, when the Levites drew their swords against their brethren at the command of Moses, to execute judgment without respect of person, because of the sin of the people in the matter of the golden calf (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-8.htm">Numbers 25:8</a>, and, for the principle here implicitly commended, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm">Matthew 10:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-29.htm">Matthew 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-26.htm">Luke 14:26</a>).  Because of their zealous devotion to the claims and service of the Lord, the dignity of the priesthood had been conferred on this tribe; and to them belonged the high office of being instructors of the people in Divine things, and of presenting the sacrifices of the people to the Lord. For those entrusted with such an office, nothing was more to be desired than that they should be blessed with power rightly to discharge the duties of their office, that their service should be accepted with favor, and that their enemies and haters should be foiled and rendered impotent; and for this Moses prays on their behalf. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the introduction Moses depicts the elevation of Israel into the nation of God, in its origin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>), its nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-3.htm">Deuteronomy 33:3</a>), its intention and its goal (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-4.htm">Deuteronomy 33:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-5.htm">Deuteronomy 33:5</a>).<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a><p>"Jehovah came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir unto them; He shone from the mountains of Paran, and came out of holy myriads, at His right rays of fire to them." To set forth the glory of the covenant which God made with Israel, Moses depicts the majesty and glory in which the Lord appeared to the Israelites at Sinai, to give them the law, and become their king. The three clauses, "Jehovah came from Sinai...from Seir...from the mountains of Paran," do not refer to different manifestations of God (Knobel), but to the one appearance of God at Sinai. Like the sun when it rises, and fills the whole of the broad horizon with its beams, the glory of the Lord, when He appeared, was not confined to one single point, but shone upon the people of Israel from Sinai, and Seir, and the mountains of Paran, as they came from the west to Sinai. The Lord appeared to the people from the summit of Sinai, as they lay encamped at the foot of the mountain. This appearance rose like a streaming light from Seir, and shone at the same time from the mountains of Paran. Seir is the mountain land of the Edomites to the east of Sinai; and the mountains of Paran are in all probability not the mountains of et-Tih, which form the southern boundary of the desert of Paran, but rather the mountains of the Azazimeh, which ascend to a great height above Kadesh, and form the boundary wall of Canaan towards the south. The glory of the Lord, who appeared upon Sinai, sent its beams even to the eastern and northern extremities of the desert. This manifestation of God formed the basis for all subsequent manifestations of the omnipotence and grace of the Lord for the salvation of His people. This explains the allusions to the description before us in the song of Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>. - The Lord came not only from Sinai, but from heaven, "out of holy myriads," i.e., out of the midst of the thousands of holy angels who surround His throne (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm">1 Kings 22:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-10.htm">Daniel 7:10</a>), and who are introduced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-12.htm">Genesis 28:12</a> as His holy servants, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2-3</a>, as the hosts of God, and form the assembly of holy ones around His throne (<a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/89-6.htm">Psalm 89:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-8.htm">Psalm 89:8</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-18.htm">Psalm 68:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-53.htm">Matthew 26:53</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-22.htm">Hebrews 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/5-11.htm">Revelation 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/7-11.htm">Revelation 7:11</a>). - The last clause is a difficult one. The writing &#1491;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; in two words, "fire of the law," not only fails to give a suitable sense, but has against it the fact that &#1491;&#1468;&#1514;, law, edictum, is not even a Semitic word, but was adopted from the Persian into the Chaldee, and that it is only by Gentiles that it is ever applied to the law of God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-12.htm">Ezra 7:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-21.htm">Ezra 7:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/7-25.htm">Ezra 7:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/6-6.htm">Daniel 6:6</a>). It must be read as one word, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1514;, as it is in many MSS and editions - not, however, as connected with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, the pouring out of the brooks, slopes of the mountains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>), but in the form &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1491;&#1514;, composed, according to the probable conjecture of Bttcher, of &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, fire, and &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1492; (in the Chaldee and Syriac), to throw, to shoot arrows, in the sense of "fire of throwing," shooting fire, a figurative description of the flashes of lightning. Gesenius adopts this explanation, except that he derives &#1491;&#1468;&#1514; from &#1497;&#1491;&#1492;, to throw. It is favoured by the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>, the appearance of God upon Sinai was accompanied by thunder and lightning; and flashes of lightning are often called the arrows of God, whilst shaadaah, in Hebrew, is established by the name &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1497;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-5.htm">Numbers 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/2-10.htm">Numbers 2:10</a>). To this we may add the parallel passage, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>, "rays out of His hand," which renders this explanation a very probable one. By "them," in the second and fifth clauses, the Israelites are intended, to whom this fearful theophany referred.
