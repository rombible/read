Judges were fixed in the sanhedrim, or court of judicature, and those that have lawsuits come before them; officers are masters of the staff and whip, and they stand before the judges, and go into markets, streets, and shops, to order the weights and measures, and to smite all that do wrong; and all they do is by order of the judges; so Maimonides (s): the qualifications of judges to be chosen and constituted by the people are thus described by him. In the sanhedrim, greater or lesser, they place only men wise and understanding, expert in the wisdom of the law, and masters of great knowledge, and that know some of the other sciences, as medicine, arithmetic, astronomy, and astrology, the ways of soothsayers, diviners, and wizards, and the vanities of idolatry, that they may know how to judge them; and they set in the sanhedrim only priests, Levites, and Israelites, who are genealogized; nor do they set an old man there, nor an eunuch, nor a king, but an high priest, if he is qualified with wisdom; and they must be free from blemishes, and of a good stature and appearance, and understand many languages, and not hear by an interpreter; and though all this was not precisely required of the sanhedrim of three judges, yet these same things ought to be in everyone of them, wisdom, and meekness, and fear, and hatred of money, and love of truth, and love of men, and to be of a good report (t) and these were to be placed in <p>all thy gates which the Lord thy God giveth thee throughout thy tribes; that is, in every city, as Onkelos, and so Jarchi; and usually the courts of judicature were held in the gates of cities, and it was only in the land of Israel, not without it, that they were obliged to set up courts of judicature, as Maimonides (u) observes; who also asks, how many courts were fixed in Israel, and what the number they consisted of? to which he answers, they fixed at first the great court in the sanctuary, and it was called the great sanhedrim, and its number were seventy one; and again, they set up two courts of twenty three, one at the door of the court, and the other at the door of the mountain of the house (and so in the Misnah) (w); and they set up in every city in Israel, in which were one hundred and twenty (men or families) or more, a lesser sanhedrim, which sat in the gate, and their number were twenty three judges; in a city in which there were not one hundred and twenty, they placed three judges, for there is no court less than three (x): <p>and they shall judge the people with just judgment; give a right and just sentence in all cases that come before them, according to the laws of God, and the rules of justice and equity. <p>(s) Hilchot Sanhedrin, c. 1. sect. 1.((t) Ib. c. 2. sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

But the former variation, though a possible, is not a certain, mark of diversity of authorship. The same author, after instituting the judges, might well address to the whole people his enforcement of the principles which were to inspire the institution, especially since (as we shall see) he left to the popular courts part of the duty of discharging justice. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-20.htm" title="That which is altogether just shall you follow, that you may live, and inherit the land which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 16:20</a> <span class="ital">b</span>, a couple of deuteronomic formulas, may well be a later scribe’s <span class="ital">malapropos</span> addition to the original law.

Whilst the people were in the wilderness, united as one body and under the leadership of Moses, this arrangement was sufficient; but a more extended arrangement would be required when they came to be settled in Canaan and dispersed in towns and villages over the whole land. In prospect of this, Moses here enacts that judges and officers were to be appointed by the people in all their gates, in all their places of residence, which the Lord should give them. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Judges and officers.</span> The "officers" (<span class="accented">shoterim</span>, writers) associated with the judges both in the earlier arrangements and in that which was to succeed were secretaries and clerks of court, and acted also as assessors and advisers of the judges. No instruction is given as to the number of judges and officers, or as to the mode of appointing them; nor was this necessary. The former would be determined by the size and population of the place where they were appointed, and the latter would, as a matter of course, follow the method instituted by Moses in the earlier arrangement (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-13.htm">Deuteronomy 1:13-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-21.htm">Exodus 18:21-26</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With regard to the Feast of Weeks (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), it is stated that the time for its observance was to be reckoned from the Passover. Seven weeks shall they count "from the beginning of the sickle to the corn," i.e., from the time when the sickle began to be applied to the corn, or from the commencement of the corn-harvest. As the corn-harvest was opened with the presentation of the sheaf of first-fruits on the second day of the Passover, this regulation as to time coincides with the rule laid down in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>. "Thou shalt keep the feast to the Lord thy God according to the measure of the free gift of thy hand, which thou givest as Jehovah thy God blesseth thee." The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514; is the standing rendering in the Chaldee for &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, sufficiency, need; it probably signifies abundance, from &#1502;&#1505;&#1505;  equals  &#1502;&#1505;&#1492;, to flow, to overflow, to derive. The idea is this: Israel was to keep this feast with sacrificial gifts, which every one was able to bring, according to the extent to which the Lord had blessed him, and (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>) to rejoice before the Lord at the place where His name dwelt with sacrificial meals, to which the needy were to be invited (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>), in remembrance of the fact that they also were bondmen in Egypt (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-15.htm">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>). The "free-will offering of the hand," which the Israelites were to bring with them to this feast, and with which they were to rejoice before the Lord, belonged to the free-will gifts of burnt-offerings, meat-offerings, drink-offerings, and thank-offerings, which might be offered, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/29-39.htm">Numbers 29:39</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-38.htm">Leviticus 23:38</a>), at every feast, along with the festal sacrifices enjoined upon the congregation. The latter were binding upon the priests and congregation, and are fully described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a> and 29, so that there was no necessity for Moses to say anything further with reference to them.</body></html>
