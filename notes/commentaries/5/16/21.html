Nothing belies God more, or tends more to corrupt the minds of men, than representing and worshipping, by an image, that God, who is an almighty and eternal Spirit, present every where.

Like the standing-stone the mast (or tree for which it stood) was frequently identified with the deity, and was probably the female counterpart to the stone.

But his reason, that every altar, to whatever deity it belonged, had an ’Asherah is hardly sufficient to prove an exclusively generic meaning for the name. Recent Assyriology appears to put beyond doubt the name ’Asherah as that of a Canaanite goddess and to give good reasons for her identification with ’Ashtoreth (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-7.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD, and forgot the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the groves.">Jdg 3:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm" title="Now therefore send, and gather to me all Israel to mount Carmel, and the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table.">1 Kings 18:19</a>).

A. S. Macalister—in one high place a row of 10, divided into 7 and 3, of which only the stumps of two remain, and the rest vary in height from 5 ft 5 ins. to 10 ft 6 ins., the largest being 4 ft 7 ins. broad by 2 ft 6 ins. thick, and in another high place a row of 4 with the stump of a fifth; at Ta‘anak by Prof. Sellin two rows of 5 each, with a pair at a little distance; and at Megiddo (Tell-el-Mutesellim) by Dr Schumacher one pair. In the high-place at Petra there are 2 great Maṣṣeboth 6 metres high, hewn out of the living rock. Those at Gezer are roughly hewn from (with one exception) the local rock, the upper end of one worked to a sharp point, and the slopes ‘polished by having been kissed, anointed, rubbed or otherwise handled,’ and another ‘carefully shaped to a rounded form’: both probably phallic (<span class="ital">PEF.

Gk <span class="greekheb">βαιτύλιον</span> and <span class="greekheb">βαίτυλος</span>, ‘animated stone,’ through the Phoenician). Because of the verb we should also read <span class="ital">maṣṣebah</span>, for the <span class="ital">mizbeaḥ, altar</span>, which Jacob <span class="ital">set up</span> at Shechem and called God, the God of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/33-20.htm" title="And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.">Genesis 33:20</a>, E). According to E (to whom most of the O.T. notices of maṣṣeboth are due) Moses put up 12 with the altar which he built on Ḥoreb1[138]. Hosea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-4.htm" title="For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:">Hosea 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm" title="Israel is an empty vine, he brings forth fruit to himself: according to the multitude of his fruit he has increased the altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made goodly images.">Hosea 10:1</a>) implies that <span class="ital">maṣṣebôth</span> were as regular parts of Jehovah’s sanctuaries in N. Israel as altars and sacrifices2[139]. With such a recognition of the <span class="ital">maṣṣeboth</span> in the worship of Jehovah the command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-3.htm" title="He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his strength he had power with God:">Hosea 12:3</a> to destroy the <span class="ital">maṣṣeboth</span> of the Canaanite sanctuaries is of course compatible. But the same cannot be said of the injunction in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-22.htm" title="Neither shall you set you up any image; which the LORD your God hates.">Deuteronomy 16:22</a> not to set up a <span class="ital">maṣṣebah</span> beside the altar of Jehovah, <span class="ital">which Jehovah thy God hateth</span> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-13.htm" title="Your graven images also will I cut off, and your standing images out of the middle of you; and you shall no more worship the work of your hands.">Micah 5:13</a>). This is another of the many marks that the deuteron. legislation is later than Hosea. It is possible, however, that there had never been a maṣṣebah in the Temple of Jerusalem. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-26.htm" title="And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.">2 Kings 10:26</a> f. Jehu is said to have <span class="ital">burned the maṣṣeboth</span> in the house of the Ba‘al in Samaria, but because of the verb some read instead <span class="ital">the ’Asherah</span>.

The two bronze columns Yakin and Bo‘az (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-21.htm" title="And he set up the pillars in the porch of the temple: and he set up the right pillar, and called the name thereof Jachin: and he set up the left pillar, and called the name thereof Boaz.">1 Kings 7:21</a>) were probably from their names ‘He foundeth’ and ‘In him is strength’ symbols of the Deity, but they did not stand in the inner sanctuary.

The asherah was an idol of wood in the form of a pillar, usually placed by the side of the altars of Baal. It was the symbol of Astarte, the great Canaanitish goddess, the companion and revealer of Baal. The two are usually associated in the Old Testament (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-13.htm">Judges 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-28.htm">Judges 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-19.htm">1 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-4.htm">2 Kings 23:4</a>). The rendering "grove" has been taken from the LXX. and the Vulgate; but that it is an error is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-2.htm">Jeremiah 17:2</a>; where the asherah is said to be <span class="accented">under</span> a green tree; and from the use of such words as <span class="accented">make</span>, <span class="accented">set up</span>, <span class="accented">cause to stand</span>, <span class="accented">build</span>, to denote the action of producing an asherah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-15.htm">1 Kings 14:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-33.htm">1 Kings 16:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-10.htm">2 Kings 17:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/33-19.htm">2 Chronicles 33:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-23.htm">1 Kings 14:23</a>), none of which are appropriate to the planting of a grove. Here, indeed, the word "plant" is used, but this is only because, as the asherah was sunk in the earth that it might stand firm, it might be figuratively said to be planted, just as nails driven in are said to be planted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-11.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:11</a>, where the same verb is used; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-16.htm">Isaiah 51:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-15.htm">Amos 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-25.htm">Daniel 11:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/16.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In connection with the Feast of Tabernacles also, he simply enforces the observance of it at the central sanctuary, and exhorts the people to rejoice at this festival, and not only to allow their sons and daughters to participate in this joy, but also the man-servant and maid-servant, and the portionless Levites, strangers, widows, and orphans. After what had already been stated, Moses did not consider it necessary to mention expressly that this festal rejoicing was also to be manifested in joyous sacrificial meals; it was enough for him to point to the blessing which God had bestowed upon their cultivation of the corn, the olive, and the vine, and upon all the works of their hands, i.e., upon their labour generally (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-13.htm">Deuteronomy 16:13-15</a>), as there was nothing further to remark after the instructions which had already been given with reference to this feast also (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-34.htm">Leviticus 23:34-36</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-39.htm">Leviticus 23:39-43</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/29-12.htm">Numbers 29:12-38</a>).</body></html>
