Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sacrifice the passover - "i. e." offer the sacrifices proper to the feast of the Passover, which lasted seven days.

The Israelites had in haste and amid anxiety to prepare the Passover meal on the evening of their flight from Egypt, and so had to omit the leavening of their bread; and this usage they had to observe during the seven days of the festival in subsequent times, to remind them of the oppression the nation had suffered in Egypt, and the circumstances of difficulty and peril amidst which their deliverance had been effected. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Application of the first-born of Cattle. - From the laws respecting the poor and slaves, to which the instructions concerning the tithes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm">Deuteronomy 14:22-29</a>) had given occasion, Moses returns to appropriation of the first-born of the herd and flock to sacrificial meals, which he had already touched upon in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-17.htm">Deuteronomy 12:17</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>, and concludes by an explanation upon this point. The command, which the Lord had given when first they came out of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>), that all the first-born of the herd and flock should be sanctified to Him, is repeated here by Moses, with the express injunction that they were not to work with the first-born of cattle (by yoking them to the plough or waggon), and not to shear the first-born of sheep; that is to say, they were not to use the first-born animals which were sanctified to the Lord for their own earthly purposes, but to offer them year by year as sacrifices to the Lord, and consume them in sacrificial meals. To this he adds (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-21.htm">Deuteronomy 15:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-22.htm">Deuteronomy 15:22</a>) that further provision, that first-born animals, which were blind or lame, or had any other bad fault, were not to be offered in sacrifice to the Lord, but, like ordinary animals used for food, could be eaten in all the towns of the land. Although the first part of this law was involved in the general laws as to the kind of animal that could be offered in sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>.), it was by no means unimportant to point out distinctly their applicability to the first-born, and add some instructions with regard to the way in which they were to be applied.
