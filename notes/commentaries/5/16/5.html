The reason of this is evident the passover itself was a sacrifice; hence Christ, as our passover, is said to be sacrificed for us, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>; and many other sacrifices, as we have just seen, were to be offered during the seven days of the feast. Now no sacrifice was accepted but from the altar that sanctified it. It was therefore necessary that they should go up to the place of the altar; for though the paschal lamb was entirely eaten by the owners in their separate apartments, yet it must be killed in the court of the tabernacle or temple, its blood sprinkled, and its inwards burned upon the altar. Besides, by confining them to the <span class="ital">appointed place, </span>he kept them to the <span class="ital">appointed rule, </span>from which they would have been apt to vary, and to introduce foolish inventions of their own, had they been permitted to offer these sacrifices within their own gates, from under the inspection of the priests. Add to this, that being appointed to attend where God had chosen to place his name, they were hereby directed to have their eye up to him in the solemnity, and <span class="ital">the desire of their hearts toward the remembrance of his name, </span>and were pointed to the place where the Messiah, the true passover, was to be slain. <span class="ital">At even — at the season that thou camest out of Egypt — </span>That is, about the time thou wast preparing to come out.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-17 The laws for the three yearly feasts are here repeated; that of the Passover, that of the Pentecost, that of Tabernacles; and the general law concerning the people's attendance. Never should a believer forget his low estate of guilt and misery, his deliverance, and the price it cost the Redeemer; that gratitude and joy in the Lord may be mingled with sorrow for sin, and patience under the tribulations in his way to the kingdom of heaven. They must rejoice in their receivings from God, and in their returns of service and sacrifice to him; our duty must be our delight, as well as our enjoyment. If those who were under the law must rejoice before God, much more we that are under the grace of the gospel; which makes it our duty to rejoice evermore, to rejoice in the Lord always. When we rejoice in God ourselves, we should do what we can to assist others also to rejoice in him, by comforting the mourners, and supplying those who are in want. All who make God their joy, may rejoice in hope, for He is faithful that has promised.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sacrifice the passover - "i. e." offer the sacrifices proper to the feast of the Passover, which lasted seven days.

The command, which the Lord had given when first they came out of Egypt (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/13-2.htm">Exodus 13:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-12.htm">Exodus 13:12</a>), that all the first-born of the herd and flock should be sanctified to Him, is repeated here by Moses, with the express injunction that they were not to work with the first-born of cattle (by yoking them to the plough or waggon), and not to shear the first-born of sheep; that is to say, they were not to use the first-born animals which were sanctified to the Lord for their own earthly purposes, but to offer them year by year as sacrifices to the Lord, and consume them in sacrificial meals. To this he adds (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-21.htm">Deuteronomy 15:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-22.htm">Deuteronomy 15:22</a>) that further provision, that first-born animals, which were blind or lame, or had any other bad fault, were not to be offered in sacrifice to the Lord, but, like ordinary animals used for food, could be eaten in all the towns of the land. Although the first part of this law was involved in the general laws as to the kind of animal that could be offered in sacrifice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-19.htm">Leviticus 22:19</a>.), it was by no means unimportant to point out distinctly their applicability to the first-born, and add some instructions with regard to the way in which they were to be applied.
