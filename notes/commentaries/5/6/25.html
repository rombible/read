We have “alms” in the Authorised Version, “righteousness” in the Revised Version. To this day the Jews call alms <span class= "ital">ts’dâkah, </span>“righteousness.”<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-25.htm" title="And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.">Deuteronomy 6:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">It shall be our righteousness — </span>Hebrew, <span class="ital">Righteousness shall be to us. </span>We shall be owned, and pronounced by God to be righteous and holy persons, if we sincerely obey him; otherwise we shall be declared to be unrighteous and ungodly. Or, <span class="ital">mercy shall be to us, </span>or <span class="ital">with us. </span>For as the Hebrew word rendered righteousness is very often put for mercy, (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-5.htm" title="He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness from the God of his salvation.">Psalm 24:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-10.htm" title="O continue your loving kindness to them that know you; and your righteousness to the upright in heart.">Psalm 36:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-14.htm" title="Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, you God of my salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of your righteousness.">Psalm 51:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-2.htm" title="Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivers from death.">Proverbs 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-4.htm" title="Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness delivers from death.">Proverbs 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-16.htm" title="O LORD, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all that are about us.">Daniel 9:16</a>,) so this sense seems best to agree both with the Scripture use of this phrase, (in which righteousness seldom or never, but grace or mercy frequently, is said to be to us, or with us,) and with the foregoing verse and argument. God, saith he, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-24.htm" title="And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>,) commanded these things for our good, that he might preserve us alive, as it is this day. And, adds he in this verse, this is not all; for as he hath done us good, so he will go on to do us more and more good, and God’s mercy shall be to us, or with us, in the remainder of our lives, and for ever, if we observe these commandments. “Our sincere obedience,” says Henry, (including in the term, repentance, faith, and love, with all other graces,) “shall be accepted through a Mediator, to denominate us, as Noah was, <span class="ital">righteous before God, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-1.htm" title="And the LORD said to Noah, Come you and all your house into the ark; for you have I seen righteous before me in this generation.">Genesis 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-6.htm" title="And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.">Luke 1:6</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm" title="Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.">1 John 3:7</a>.

Negligence will ruin us; but we cannot be saved without diligence. It is our interest, as well as our duty, to be religious. It will be our life. Godliness has the promise of the continuance and comfort of the life that now is, as far as it is for God's glory. It will be our righteousness. It is only through the Mediator we can be righteous before God. The knowledge of the spirituality and excellency of the holy law of God, is suited to show sinful man his need of a Saviour, and to prepare his heart to welcome a free salvation. The gospel honours the law, not only in the perfect obedience of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ; but in that it is a plan for bringing back apostate rebels and enemies, by repentance, faith, forgiveness, and renewing grace, to love God above all things, even in this world; and in the world above, to love him perfectly, even as angels love him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It shall be our righteousness - i. e., God will esteem us as righteous and deal with us accordingly.

Or a mercy, benefit, and blessing to us; or this shall be reckoned our righteousness, and that by which we shall be justified: <p>if we observe to do all these commandments before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us; in order to have such a justifying righteousness, a man must keep all the commandments of God, not one excepted; and that perfectly, without the least breach of them in thought, word, or deed; and that before the Lord, in his sight, not as it may appear to a man himself, or to others, but as it appears to God, who sees the heart, and weighs all actions; and a man must keep them in the manner the Lord has commanded, even with all his heart, soul, and strength, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> and this is not possible for a sinful man to do; and therefore righteousness cannot be by the law.
