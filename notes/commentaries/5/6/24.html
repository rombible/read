Negligence will ruin us; but we cannot be saved without diligence. It is our interest, as well as our duty, to be religious. It will be our life. Godliness has the promise of the continuance and comfort of the life that now is, as far as it is for God's glory. It will be our righteousness. It is only through the Mediator we can be righteous before God. The knowledge of the spirituality and excellency of the holy law of God, is suited to show sinful man his need of a Saviour, and to prepare his heart to welcome a free salvation. The gospel honours the law, not only in the perfect obedience of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ; but in that it is a plan for bringing back apostate rebels and enemies, by repentance, faith, forgiveness, and renewing grace, to love God above all things, even in this world; and in the world above, to love him perfectly, even as angels love him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The command "to swear by His Name" is not inconsistent with the Lord's injunction <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>, "Swear not at all." Moses refers to legal swearing, our Lord to swearing in common conversation. It is not the purpose of Moses to encourage the practice of taking oaths, but to forbid that, when taken, they should be taken in any other name than that of Israel's God. The oath involves an invocation of Deity, and so a solemn recognition of Him whose Name is made use of in it. Hence, it comes especially within the scope of the commandment Moses is enforcing.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-25. when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying&#8212;The directions given for the instruction of their children form only an extension of the preceding counsels.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The benefit of obedience is ours, not God’s <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/35-7.htm" title="If you be righteous, what give you him? or what receives he of your hand?">Job 35:7</a></span> and therefore our obedience is highly reasonable, and absolutely necessary. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord commanded us to do all these statutes,....

Notice, too, how naturally <span class="ital">Jehovah</span> is used instead of the deuteronomic <span class="ital">Jehovah thy God</span>; for here we have, not Moses addressing Israel, but Moses quoting what Israel are to say to their children; so, too, <span class="ital">Jehovah our God</span> (thrice) is to be explained. Thus two of Steuernagel’s reasons for counting the passage as secondary (that Sg. does not elsewhere in the introductory discourses take the laws as already published and that Jehovah our God does not elsewhere occur in the Sg.) are disposed of. He has missed the standpoint of the speakers whom Moses quotes. Steuernagel’s third reason for the secondariness of the passage—that it interrupts by its emphasis on obedience the Sg. course of thought, which before and after it warns against the worship of other gods—is insufficient.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">might preserve us alive</span>] Sustain the national existence which He had begun by the redemption from Egypt (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-21.htm" title="Then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:">Deuteronomy 6:21</a></span>). The Law is given to preserve the life born in that deed of grace. See above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">alive, as at this day</span>] ‘It deserves attention that this points to the composition [of the passage] as pre-exilic, for the Exile was felt as death’ (Bertholet). This would be a good argument if the words were part of Moses’ direct address to Israel, but they are spoken from the standpoint of a generation settled in Palestine.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>They were rather to observe all His commandments diligently, and do what was right and good in His eyes.
