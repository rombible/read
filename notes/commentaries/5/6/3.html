Moses taught the people all that, and that only, which God commanded him to teach. Thus Christ's ministers are to teach his churches all he has commanded, neither more nor less, Mt 28:20. The fear of God in the heart will be the most powerful principle of obedience. It is highly desirable that not we only, but our children, and our children's children, may fear the Lord.

Moses Exhorts Israel to Hear God and to Keep His Commandments.<p>1-9. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them &#8230; whither ye go to possess it&#8212;The grand design of all the institutions prescribed to Israel was to form a religious people, whose national character should be distinguished by that fear of the Lord their God which would ensure their divine observance of His worship and their steadfast obedience to His will. The basis of their religion was an acknowledgment of the unity of God with the understanding and the love of God in the heart (De 6:4, 5). Compared with the religious creed of all their contemporaries, how sound in principle, how elevated in character, how unlimited in the extent of its moral influence on the heart and habits of the people! Indeed, it is precisely the same basis on which rests the purer and more spiritual form of it which Christianity exhibits (Mt 22:37; Mr 12:30; Lu 10:27). Moreover, to help in keeping a sense of religion in their minds, it was commanded that its great principles should be carried about with them wherever they went, as well as meet their eyes every time they entered their homes. A further provision was made for the earnest inculcation of them on the minds of the young by a system of parental training, which was designed to associate religion with all the most familiar and oft-recurring scenes of domestic life. It is probable that Moses used the phraseology in De 6:7 merely in a figurative way, to signify assiduous, earnest, and frequent instruction; and perhaps he meant the metaphorical language in De 6:8 to be taken in the same sense also. But as the Israelites interpreted it literally, many writers suppose that a reference was made to a superstitious custom borrowed from the Egyptians, who wore jewels and ornamental trinkets on the forehead and arm, inscribed with certain words and sentences, as amulets to protect them from danger. These, it has been conjectured, Moses intended to supersede by substituting sentences of the law; and so the Hebrews understood him, for they have always considered the wearing of the Tephilim, or frontlets, a permanent obligation. The form was as follows: Four pieces of parchment, inscribed, the first with Ex 13:2-10; the second with Ex 13:11-16; the third with De 6:1-8; and the fourth with De 11:18-21, were enclosed in a square case or box of tough skin, on the side of which was placed the Hebrew letter (shin), and bound round the forehead with a thong or ribbon. When designed for the arms, those four texts were written on one slip of parchment, which, as well as the ink, was carefully prepared for the purpose. With regard to the other usage supposed to be alluded to, the ancient Egyptians had the lintels and imposts of their doors and gates inscribed with sentences indicative of a favorable omen [Wilkinson]; and this is still the case, for in Egypt and other Mohammedan countries, the front doors of houses (in Cairo, for instance) are painted red, white, and green, bearing conspicuously inscribed upon them such sentences from the Koran, as "God is the Creator," "God is one, and Mohammed is his prophet." Moses designed to turn this ancient and favorite custom to a better account and ordered that, instead of the former superstitious inscriptions, there should be written the words of God, persuading and enjoining the people to hold the laws in perpetual remembrance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it,....

But the fulfillment of this promise was conditioned by their continuing as a people in the fear of God, and in obedience to his Law. Everything, then, depended on their hearing what Moses had been commanded to teach them, and observing to do it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-9.htm">Leviticus 26:9</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">In the land</span>, etc. This is to be connected with the clause, "that it may be well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily;" the land was to be the scene and sphere of their prosperity and increase.

There is, indeed, no preposition before "the land" in the Hebrew; but nothing is more common in that language than for the accusative of a noun to be used adverbially to describe the place where anything is done. <span class="cmt_word">Milk and honey</span>; emblem of fruitfulness and sweetness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/4-11.htm">Song of Solomon 4:11</a>); proverbially descriptive of Canaan, as rich in pasturage for flocks, and abounding in flowers whence the bees could extract honey (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-8.htm">Exodus 3:8, 17</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24-27</a> contain a rhetorical, and at the same time really a more exact, account of the events described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-20</a> (15-17). &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>), a contraction of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a> (cf. Ewald, 184, a.). Jehovah's reply to the words of the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-28.htm">Deuteronomy 5:28-31</a>) is passed over in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20.htm">Exodus 20</a>. God approved of what the people said, because it sprang from a consciousness of the unworthiness of any sinner to come into the presence of the holy God; and He added, "Would that there were always this heart in them to fear Me," i.e., would that they were always of the same mind to fear Me and keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and their children for ever. He then directed the people to return to their tents, and appointed Moses as the mediator, to whom He would address all the law, that he might teach it to the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>). Having been thus entreated by the people to take the office of mediator, and appointed to that office by the Lord, Moses could very well bring his account of these events to a close (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>), by exhorting them to observe carefully all the commandments of the Lord, and not to turn aside to the right hand or to the left, i.e., not to depart in any way from the mode of life pointed out in the commandments (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, etc.), that it might be well with them, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>). &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, perfect with &#1493; rel. instead of the imperfect. </body></html>
