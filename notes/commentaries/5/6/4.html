The first words of the Talmud concern the hours when this form should be recited in daily morning or evening prayer—“Hear, O Israel: Jehovah our God is one Jehovah” The unity of Jehovah, as opposed to the belief in “gods many and lords many,” is the key-note of the Jewish faith. “<span class= "ital">We </span>worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity.” But this truth, though visible in the Old Testament by the light of the New, was not explicitly revealed until it came forth in history, when the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world, and both sent the Holy Spirit to represent Him in the Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Hear, O Israel! — </span>The passage contained in this and the following verse, the Jews reckoned one of their choicest portions of Scripture.

Jehovah our God is the only living and true God; he only is God, and he is but One God. Let us not desire to have any other. The three-fold mention of the Divine names, and the plural number of the word translated God, seem plainly to intimate a Trinity of persons, even in this express declaration of the unity of the Godhead. Happy those who have this one Lord for their God. It is better to have one fountain than a thousand cisterns; one all-sufficient God than a thousand insufficient friends. This is the first and great commandment of God's law, that we love him; and that we do all parts of our duty to him from a principle of love; My son, give me thine heart. We are to love God with all our heart, and soul, and might. That is, 1. With a sincere love; not in word and tongue only, but inwardly in truth. 2. With a strong love. He that is our All, must have our all, and none but he. 3. With a superlative love; we must love God above any creature whatever, and love nothing but what we love for him. 4. With an intelligent love. To love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, we must see good cause to love him. 5. With an entire love; he is ONE, our hearts must be united in his love.

They may be called "the creed of the Jews."<p>This weighty text contains far more than a mere declaration of the unity of God as against polytheism; or of the sole authority of the revelation that He had made to Israel as against other pretended manifestations of His will and attributes. It asserts that the Lord God of Israel is absolutely God, and none other. He, and He alone, is Jehovah (Yahweh) the absolute, uncaused God; the One who had, by His election of them, made Himself known to Israel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 6<p>De 6:1-25. Moses Exhorts Israel to Hear God and to Keep His Commandments.<p>1-9. Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the Lord your God commanded to teach you, that ye might do them &#8230; whither ye go to possess it&#8212;The grand design of all the institutions prescribed to Israel was to form a religious people, whose national character should be distinguished by that fear of the Lord their God which would ensure their divine observance of His worship and their steadfast obedience to His will. The basis of their religion was an acknowledgment of the unity of God with the understanding and the love of God in the heart (De 6:4, 5). Compared with the religious creed of all their contemporaries, how sound in principle, how elevated in character, how unlimited in the extent of its moral influence on the heart and habits of the people! Indeed, it is precisely the same basis on which rests the purer and more spiritual form of it which Christianity exhibits (Mt 22:37; Mr 12:30; Lu 10:27). Moreover, to help in keeping a sense of religion in their minds, it was commanded that its great principles should be carried about with them wherever they went, as well as meet their eyes every time they entered their homes. A further provision was made for the earnest inculcation of them on the minds of the young by a system of parental training, which was designed to associate religion with all the most familiar and oft-recurring scenes of domestic life. It is probable that Moses used the phraseology in De 6:7 merely in a figurative way, to signify assiduous, earnest, and frequent instruction; and perhaps he meant the metaphorical language in De 6:8 to be taken in the same sense also. But as the Israelites interpreted it literally, many writers suppose that a reference was made to a superstitious custom borrowed from the Egyptians, who wore jewels and ornamental trinkets on the forehead and arm, inscribed with certain words and sentences, as amulets to protect them from danger. These, it has been conjectured, Moses intended to supersede by substituting sentences of the law; and so the Hebrews understood him, for they have always considered the wearing of the Tephilim, or frontlets, a permanent obligation. The form was as follows: Four pieces of parchment, inscribed, the first with Ex 13:2-10; the second with Ex 13:11-16; the third with De 6:1-8; and the fourth with De 11:18-21, were enclosed in a square case or box of tough skin, on the side of which was placed the Hebrew letter (shin), and bound round the forehead with a thong or ribbon. When designed for the arms, those four texts were written on one slip of parchment, which, as well as the ink, was carefully prepared for the purpose. With regard to the other usage supposed to be alluded to, the ancient Egyptians had the lintels and imposts of their doors and gates inscribed with sentences indicative of a favorable omen [Wilkinson]; and this is still the case, for in Egypt and other Mohammedan countries, the front doors of houses (in Cairo, for instance) are painted red, white, and green, bearing conspicuously inscribed upon them such sentences from the Koran, as "God is the Creator," "God is one, and Mohammed is his prophet." Moses designed to turn this ancient and favorite custom to a better account and ordered that, instead of the former superstitious inscriptions, there should be written the words of God, persuading and enjoining the people to hold the laws in perpetual remembrance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> One in essence, and the only object of our worship. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Hear, O Israel,.... These are the words of Moses, stirring up the people to an attention to what he was about to say of this great and momentous article, the unity of God, to prevent their going into polytheism and idolatry. From one of the words here used, the Jews call this section Kiriathshema, which they oblige themselves to read twice a day, morning and evening (n); the last letter of the first word in this verse, "Shema", meaning "hear", and the last letter of the last word in it, "Echad", meaning "one", are greater than ordinary; which seems designed to excite the attention to what is contained in this passage: <p>the Lord our God is one Lord; the doctrine of which is, that the Lord, who was the covenant God and Father of his people Israel, is but one Jehovah; he is Jehovah, the Being of beings, a self-existent Being, eternal and immutable; and he is but one in nature and essence; this appears from the perfection of his nature, his eternity, omnipotence, omnipresence, infinity, goodness, self-sufficiency, and perfection; for there can be but one eternal, one omnipotent, one omnipresent, one infinite, one that is originally and of himself good; one self, and all sufficient, and perfect Being; and which also may be concluded from his being the first cause of all things, which can be but one; and from his relations to his creatures, as their King, ruler, governor, and lawgiver. And for this purpose these words are cited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-29.htm">Mark 12:29</a> but then they no ways contradict the doctrine of a trinity of persons in the unity of the divine essence, the Father, Word, and Holy Spirit, which three are one; the one God, the one Jehovah, as here expressed; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-7.htm">1 John 5:7</a> and so the ancient Jews understood this passage. In an ancient book of theirs it is said (o) Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah (i.e. Jehovah, our God, Jehovah); these are the three degrees with respect to this sublime mystery; "in the beginning God (Elohim) created the heavens and the earth"; and again (p), Jehovah, Elohenu, Jehovah, they are one; the three forms (modes or things) which are one; and elsewhere (q) it is observed, there are two, and one is joined to them, and they are three; and when the three are one, he says to (or of) them, these are the two names which Israel heard, Jehovah, Jehovah, and Elohenu (our God) is joined unto them; and it is the seal of the ring of truth, and when they are joined they are one in one unity; which is illustrated by the three names the soul of man is called by, the soul, spirit, and breath; and elsewhere they say (r) the holy blessed God, and his Shechinah, are called one; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-30.htm">John 10:30</a>. <p>(n) Mist.

There, as here, Moses uses the Pl. address for his own words, but quotes what God gave him at Ḥoreb in the Sg.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the Lord our God is one Lord</span>] As the R. V. marg. shows, this is one of four possible translations of the elliptic Hebrew: <span class="ital">Jehovah our-God, Jehovah One</span>. The other three are: <span class="ital">Jehovah our God, Jehovah is One; Jehovah is our God, Jehovah is One; Jehovah is our God, Jehovah alone</span>. But the four are resolvable into these two: First, <span class="ital">Jehovah our God is One</span>, an expression of His unity, appropriate at a time when we know from Jeremiah that by the multiplication of His shrines the people of Judah conceived Him, as Baal or Ashtoreth was conceived, not as One, but as many deities with different characteristics and powers over different localities, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-28.htm" title="But where are your gods that you have made you? let them arise, if they can save you in the time of your trouble: for according to the number of your cities are your gods, O Judah.">Jeremiah 2:28</a>. Second, <span class="ital">Jehovah is our God alone</span>: i.e. Israel’s <span class="ital">only</span> God, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm" title="And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall there be one LORD, and his name one.">Zechariah 14:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/6-9.htm" title="My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bore her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yes, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.">Song of Solomon 6:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm" title="Furthermore David the king said to all the congregation, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man, but for the LORD God.">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>. These passages are all post-exilic, and in the first two <span class="ital">one</span> may mean <span class="ital">unique</span>, but that here it means <span class="ital">only</span> (for Israel) is probable from the following verse. Some interpreters take the verse as ‘a great declaration of monotheism’ (so Driver). But had that been the intention of the writer the clause would have run ‘Jehovah is <span class="ital">the</span> God, Jehovah alone.’ The use of the term <span class="ital">our-God</span> shows that the meaning simply is Jehovah is <span class="ital">Israel’s only God</span>. Nothing is said as to the existence or non-existence of other gods, and the verse is therefore on an equality with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-7.htm" title="You shall have none other gods before me.">Deuteronomy 5:7</a>, the First Commandment, and with <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm" title="Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>, which implies no more than that Jehovah is <span class="ital">a</span> or <span class="ital">the</span> God indeed; cp. the curious <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> <span class="ital">b</span> which seeks to reconcile His sovereignty with the fact that other gods are worshipped by other nations. Only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-35.htm" title="To you it was showed, that you might know that the LORD he is God; there is none else beside him.">Deuteronomy 4:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-39.htm" title="Know therefore this day, and consider it in your heart, that the LORD he is God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath: there is none else.">Deuteronomy 4:39</a> does an explicit declaration of monotheism appear in Deut.; it is to be remembered, however, that on other grounds the post-exilic date of these verses is possible1[126]. At the same time the phrase used here lends itself readily to the expression of an absolute monotheism, which later ages of a wider faith read into it. It is interesting to compare with our verse St Paul’s statement <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one....">1 Corinthians 8:4-6</a>; <span class="ital">we know that no idol is</span> anything <span class="ital">in the world and that there is no God but one; for though there be that are called gods …; as there be gods many and lords many, yet to us there is One God, the Father, of whom are all things</span>. Note even here <span class="ital">yet to us</span>!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[126] This is not meant to imply that some in Israel had not thrown off belief in the reality of other gods before the Exile. Jeremiah certainly had: e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm" title="Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">4–9</span>. The Essential Creed and Duty of Israel, with enforcement of them. Known from its initial word as The <span class="ital">Shĕma‘</span> (= <span class="ital">Hear</span>), this section (along with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,...">Deuteronomy 11:13-21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-37.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 15:37-41</a>) ‘has been for many ages the first bit of the Bible which Jewish children have learned to say and to read, just as it has for many ages formed the confession of faith among all members of the brotherhood of Judaism’ (C. G. Montefiore, <span class="ital">The Bible for Home Reading</span>, Pt i. 127). The later law required its recital by a Jew twice daily; for particulars see Schürer, <span class="ital">Gesrh. des jüd. Volkes</span>, § 27 and Appendix (3rd Germ. ed. ii. 459 f.; E.T. Div. ii. Vol. ii. pp. 77, 84). The LXX inserts before it a longish title1[125], which shows how late this editorial practice of inserting titles to important sections of Deut. continued, and explains some similar headings in the Heb. text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[125] ‘And these are the statutes and the judgements which the Lord commanded to the children of Israel, when they were coming out of the land of Egypt.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 4-25.</span> - THE FIRST AND GREAT COMMANDMENT. "In the fear of Jehovah all true obedience is rooted (vers. 2, 3); for this is the first and most intimate fact in the relation of Israel and Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-26.htm">Deuteronomy 5:26</a>). But where the supreme fear of Jehovah hinders men from allowing self to preponderate in opposition to God, there will be no stopping at this renunciation of self-will, though this comes first as the negative form of the ten commandments also shows, but there will come to be a coalescence of the human with the Divine will; and this is love, which is the proper condition of obedience, as the ten commandments also indicate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-10.htm">Deuteronomy 5:10</a>)" (Baumgarten). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord.</span> This is an affirmation not so much of the <span class="accented">moneity</span> as of the <span class="accented">unity</span> and <span class="accented">simplicity</span> of Jehovah, the alone God. Though Elohim (plu.), he is one. The speaker does not say, "Jehovah is alone God," but "Jehovah our Elohim is one Jehovah" (comp. for the force of <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5b6;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5d3;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-6.htm">Exodus 26:6, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-16.htm">Ezekiel 37:16-19</a>). Among the heathen there were many Baals and many Jupiters; and it was believed that the deity might be divided and communicated to many. But the God of Israel, Jehovah, is one, indivisible and incommunicable. He is the Absolute and the  Infinite One, who alone is to be worshipped, on whom all depend, and to whose command all must yield obedience (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-9.htm">Zechariah 14:9</a>). Not only to polytheism, but to pantheism, and to the conception of a localized or national deity, is this declaration of the unity of Jehovah opposed. With these words the Jews begin their daily liturgy, morning and evening; the sentence expresses the essence of their religious belief; and so familiar is it to their thought and speech that, it is said, they were often, during the persecution in Spain, betrayed to their enemies by the involuntary utterance of it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24-27</a> contain a rhetorical, and at the same time really a more exact, account of the events described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-18.htm">Exodus 20:18-20</a> (15-17). &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a>), a contraction of &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a> (cf.

God approved of what the people said, because it sprang from a consciousness of the unworthiness of any sinner to come into the presence of the holy God; and He added, "Would that there were always this heart in them to fear Me," i.e., would that they were always of the same mind to fear Me and keep all My commandments, that it might be well with them and their children for ever. He then directed the people to return to their tents, and appointed Moses as the mediator, to whom He would address all the law, that he might teach it to the people (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm">Deuteronomy 4:5</a>). Having been thus entreated by the people to take the office of mediator, and appointed to that office by the Lord, Moses could very well bring his account of these events to a close (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-32.htm">Deuteronomy 5:32</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-33.htm">Deuteronomy 5:33</a>), by exhorting them to observe carefully all the commandments of the Lord, and not to turn aside to the right hand or to the left, i.e., not to depart in any way from the mode of life pointed out in the commandments (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-20.htm">Deuteronomy 17:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-14.htm">Deuteronomy 28:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/1-7.htm">Joshua 1:7</a>, etc.), that it might be well with them, etc. (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-40.htm">Deuteronomy 4:40</a>). &#1493;&#1496;&#1493;&#1489;, perfect with &#1493; rel. instead of the imperfect. </body></html>
