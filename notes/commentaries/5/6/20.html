Negligence will ruin us; but we cannot be saved without diligence. It is our interest, as well as our duty, to be religious. It will be our life. Godliness has the promise of the continuance and comfort of the life that now is, as far as it is for God's glory. It will be our righteousness. It is only through the Mediator we can be righteous before God. The knowledge of the spirituality and excellency of the holy law of God, is suited to show sinful man his need of a Saviour, and to prepare his heart to welcome a free salvation. The gospel honours the law, not only in the perfect obedience of the Son of God, the Lord Jesus Christ; but in that it is a plan for bringing back apostate rebels and enemies, by repentance, faith, forgiveness, and renewing grace, to love God above all things, even in this world; and in the world above, to love him perfectly, even as angels love him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The command "to swear by His Name" is not inconsistent with the Lord's injunction <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>, "Swear not at all." Moses refers to legal swearing, our Lord to swearing in common conversation. It is not the purpose of Moses to encourage the practice of taking oaths, but to forbid that, when taken, they should be taken in any other name than that of Israel's God. The oath involves an invocation of Deity, and so a solemn recognition of Him whose Name is made use of in it. Hence, it comes especially within the scope of the commandment Moses is enforcing.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20-25. when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying&#8212;The directions given for the instruction of their children form only an extension of the preceding counsels.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when thy son asketh thee in time to come,....

These verses return to a favourite theme of Deut.: the close relation between Jehovah’s Laws and His Deeds.

When asked by their sons the meaning and reason of the commandments and institutes which they observed, they were to show them what the Lord had done for his people in bringing them out of Egypt and establishing them in Canaan, and how he had enjoined on them all these statutes that they might fear Jehovah their God for their good always, and for their preservation and safety. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The worship of Jehovah not only precludes all idolatry, which the Lord, as a jealous God, will not endure (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>), but will punish with destruction from the earth ("the face of the ground," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-12.htm">Exodus 32:12</a>); but it also excludes tempting the Lord by an unbelieving murmuring against God, if He does not remove any kind of distress immediately, as the people had already sinned at Massah, i.e., at Rephidim (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/17-1.htm">Exodus 17:1-7</a>). </body></html>
