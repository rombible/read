Love will work in obedience, and that only is acceptable obedience which flows from a principle of love, 1Jo 5:3. Moses recounts some of the great and terrible works of God which their eyes had seen. What our eyes have seen, especially in our early days, should affect us, and make us better long afterwards.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And know ... - Render it: And own ye this day (for I have not to do with your children which have not known and which have not seen) the chastisement of the Lord, his greatness, etc.<p>The "chastisement" consisted in the many mighty acts, both of punishment and mercy, through which God had guided them from Egypt to the borders of the promised land. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2-9. I speak not with your children which have not known &#8230; But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did&#8212;Moses is here giving a brief summary of the marvels and miracles of awful judgment which God had wrought in effecting their release from the tyranny of Pharaoh, as well as those which had taken place in the wilderness. He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents. For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should die in the wilderness, and its execution, extended only to males from twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi, were objects of the denunciation (see Nu 14:28-30; 16:49). There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and advantages of obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came unto this place.

One instance of the latter is expressly referred to - the destruction of those who joined in the insurrection of Korah (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Moses does not mention Korah himself here, but only his accomplices Dathan and Abiram, probably, as Keil suggests, "from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah;" perhaps also because, though Korah was at the head of the insurrection, Dathan and Abiram were the more determined, audacious, and obdurate in their rebellion (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-12.htm">Numbers 16:12-15, 25, 26</a>), so that it came to be named from them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After laying down the fundamental condition of a proper relation towards God, Moses describes the fear of God, i.e., true reverence of God, in its threefold manifestation, in deed (serving God), in heart (cleaving to Him; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-4.htm">Deuteronomy 4:4</a>), and with the mouth (swearing by His name; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>). Such reverence as this Israel owed to its God; for "He is thy praise, and He is thy God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-21.htm">Deuteronomy 10:21</a>). He has given thee strong inducements to praise. By the great and terrible things which thine eyes have seen, He has manifested Himself as God to thee. "Terrible things" are those acts of divine omnipotence, which fill men with fear and trembling at the majesty of the Almighty (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-11.htm">Exodus 15:11</a>). &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, "done with thee," i.e., shown to thee (&#1488;&#1514; in the sense of practical help). </body></html>
