Thus he informs them that the promised land was of such a condition as would keep them in a constant dependance upon God for the fruitfulness of it. He means, however, also to signify that it was much more pleasant and healthful than Egypt, which, as it was enriched, so it was annoyed with the Nile, which, overflowing the land in summer-time, made the country both unpleasant and unhealthy. And health being the greatest of all outward blessings, Canaan must therefore be a more desirable habitation than Egypt. <span class="ital">The rain of heaven — </span>Which was more easily obtained, being given them without any charge or pains; more sweet and pleasant, not hindering their going abroad upon their affairs, as the overflowing of the Nile did; more safe and healthful, being free from that mud which attended the waters of the Nile; and more certain too, while they were obedient, the former and the latter rain being promised to be given to them in the proper season, on condition of their adhering to God’s worship, and obeying his laws. And even this condition, though it might seem a clog and inconvenience, yet indeed was a great benefit; for thus, by their own interest and necessities, they were obliged to that obedience and reliance on God upon which their happiness depended, both for this life and the next.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:8-17 Moses sets before them, for the future, life and death, the blessing and the curse, according as they did or did not keep God's commandment. Sin tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of a people's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all good things, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness into the heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revolt from God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that your hearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection upon any creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their own destruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want of taking heed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another motive for fidelity is added, namely, the entire dependence of the promised land upon God for its fertility. It was "a land flowing with milk and honey;" yet this its richness was not, as was that of Egypt, the reward of truman skill and labor, but was, on the contrary, the gift of God simply and entirely; the effect of "the former and the latter rains" sent by Him. The spiritual significance of these and many other such peculiarities of the promised land must not be overlooked.<p>Egypt and Canaan are distinguished in this and the following verses, by certain of their most remarkable physical traits. Canaan as a mountainous country (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-25.htm">Deuteronomy 3:25</a> note) was well watered, but by the rains of heaven, on which it absolutely depended for its crops. Artificial irrigation could do nothing to remedy this dependence. Hence, it was a land on which, so long as God's people were faithful and consequently prosperous, "the eyes of God" would always be: i. e., He would supply at each successive season (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14-15</a>) the useful conditions of productiveness. But Egypt, fit emblem here as elsewhere of the world of nature in distinction from the world of grace, though of course deriving its all ultimately from the Giver of all good things, yet directly and immediately owed its riches and plenty to human ingenuity and capital. It enjoyed no rain worth speaking of, but drew its water supply from the annum overflowing of the Nile. This only lasts about a hundred days; but is rendered available for agricultural purposes throughout the year by an elaborate and costly system of tanks, canals, forcing machines, etc. To these mechanical appliances allusion is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10</a>. The inhabitants of Egypt probably watered "with the foot" in two ways, namely, by means of tread-wheels working sets of pumps, and by means of artificial channels connected with reservoirs, and opened, turned, or closed by the feet. Both methods are still in use in Egypt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-12. For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out&#8212;The physical features of Palestine present a striking contrast to those of the land of bondage. A widely extending plain forms the cultivated portion of Egypt, and on the greater part of this low and level country rain never falls. This natural want is supplied by the annual overflow of the Nile, and by artificial means from the same source when the river has receded within its customary channel. Close by the bank the process of irrigation is very simple. The cultivator opens a small sluice on the edge of the square bed in which seed has been sown, making drill after drill; and when a sufficient quantity of water has poured in, he shuts it up with his foot. Where the bank is high, the water is drawn up by hydraulic engines, of which there are three kinds used, of different power, according to the subsidence of the stream. The water is distributed in small channels or earthen conduits, simple in construction, worked by the foot, and formed with a mattock by the gardener who directs their course, and which are banked up or opened, as occasion may require, by pressing in the soil with the foot. Thus was the land watered in which the Israelites had dwelt so long. Such vigilance and laborious industry would not be needed in the promised land. Instead of being visited with moisture only at one brief season and left during the rest of the year under a withering blight, every season it would enjoy the benign influences of a genial climate. The hills would attract the frequent clouds, and in the refreshing showers the blessing of God would especially rest upon the land.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A land of hills and valleys; </span> and therefore much more healthful than Egypt was, which as it was enriched, so it was annoyed with Nilus, which overflowed the land in summer time, and thereby made the country both unpleasant and, which is much worse, unhealthful.

And so could not be watered by the overflow of a river, and by canals cut out of it, and in the manner Egypt was; which was for the most part a plain and flat country, but not so Canaan, in which were many hills and mountains, as those about Jerusalem, Carmel, Tabor, Lebanon, and others; and plains and valleys, as the valley of Jezreel, &amp;c. and which made it more delightful and pleasant for prospects; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-7.htm">Deuteronomy 8:7</a> and drinketh water of the rain of heaven; by which it was watered, refreshed, and made fruitful; not by means of men, but by the Lord himself, and so with much more ease to men, and without the toil and labour they were obliged to in Egypt, as well as it was both more healthful and pleasant; for the damps that arose from the overflow of the Nile were sometimes prejudicial to health; and during the season of its overflow, which was in the summer, they were obliged to keep in their houses, and could not walk abroad for weeks together; to which inconveniences the land of Canaan was not subject; but then, as its fertility depended on rain from heaven, the Israelites would be under the greater obligation to observe the commands of God, who could give and withhold it at his pleasure, and as they conducted themselves; which seems to be the general drift of this passage. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">whither ye go over to possess it</span>] This Pl. interruption is redundant even for the deuteronomic style (cp. 8 and 10) and unnecessary for the contrast which the writer is making: most probably editorial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a land of hills and valleys</span>] This, too, is essential to the writer’s contrast of the land with Egypt: for the configuration of the land (cp.

The words from "for (I speak) not" to "have not seen" are a parenthetical clause, by which Moses would impress his words most strongly upon the hearts of the older generation, which had witnessed the acts of the Lord. The clause is without any verb or predicate, but this can easily be supplied from the sense. The best suggestion is that of Schultz, viz., &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, "for it is not with your children that I have to do," not to them that this admonition applies. Moses refers to the children who had been born in the desert, as distinguished from those who, though not twenty years old when the Israelites came out of Egypt, had nevertheless seen with their own eyes the plagues inflicted upon Egypt, and who were now of mature age, viz., between forty and sixty years old, and formed, as the older and more experienced generation, the stock and kernel of the congregation assembled round him now. To the words, "which have not known and have not seen," it is easy to supply from the context, "what ye have known and seen." The accusatives from "the chastisement" onwards belong to the verb of the principal sentence, "know ye this day." The accusatives which follow show what we are to understand by "the chastisement of the Lord," viz., the mighty acts of the Lord to Egypt and to Israel in the desert. The object of them all was to educate Israel in the fear and love of God. In this sense Moses calls them &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; (Eng. Ver. chastisement), &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, i.e., not punishment only, but education by the manifestation of love as well as punishment (like &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-36.htm">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, etc.). "His greatness," etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>. On the signs and acts in Egypt, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; and on those at the Red Sea, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; - &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "over whose face He made the waters of the Red Sea to flow;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26</a>. - By the acts of God in the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-5.htm">Deuteronomy 11:5</a>) we are not to understand the chastenings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11-15</a> either solely or pre-eminently, but all the manifestations of the omnipotence of God in the guidance of Israel, proofs of love as well as the penal wonders. Of the latter, the miraculous destruction of the company of Korah is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Here Moses only mentions Dathan and Abiram, the followers of Korah, and not Korah himself, probably from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah. "Everything existing, which was in their following" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>), does not mean their possessions, but their servants, and corresponds to "all the men who belonged to Korah" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>, whereas the possessions mentioned there are included here in the "tents." &#1492;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is only applied to living beings, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm">Deuteronomy 11:7</a> the reason is given for the admonition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a> : the elders were to know (discern) the educational purpose of God in those mighty acts of the Lord, because they had seen them with their own eyes. </body></html>
