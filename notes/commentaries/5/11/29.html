There were several places of this name W. of Jordan and still marked by Arabic forms of it (see ‘Gilgal’ in <span class="ital">E. B.</span> by the present writer): (1) One was the Gilgal near Jericho, and with this certain Rabbis, followed by Eusebius, Jerome, and a constant Christian tradition, have identified the Gilgal of our text. So, too, a number of modern commentators. Others, changing the punctuation, refer the words <span class="ital">over against the Gilgal</span> to <span class="ital">the Canaanites which dwell in the ‘Arabah</span>. (2) A second Gilgal lay on the Western Range above Bethel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/2-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal....">2 Kings 2:1-8</a>) and has been identified with the present Jiljilyeh seven miles N. of Bethel, which, though actually lower than Bethel, stands on a hill so bold and isolated that the phrase to go down thence to Bethel would not be inappropriate. This also has been identified with the Gilgal of our text, yet it is at a good distance from Gerizim and ‘Ebal, and stands in no definite relation to them. (3) Dillmann supposed some Gilgal near Shechem, and his hypothesis has been justified by the discovery of the name Juleijil (Ar. dimin. of <span class="ital">Gilgal</span>) on the plain one mile E. of the foot of Gerizim and 2½ miles SE. of Shechem. This suits the data of our passage (including the following <span class="ital">oaks</span> or <span class="ital">terebinths of Moreh</span>), and its claims have been defended in detail by Schlatter (<span class="ital">Zur Topogr. u. Gesch. Palästinas</span>, 246 ff.) and accepted by Buhl (<span class="ital">Pal.</span> 202 ff.); cp. the present writer in <span class="ital">Critical Review</span>, Oct. 1895, 346 ff., and art. ‘Gilgal’ in <span class="ital">E.B.</span>; and Driver, <span class="ital">Deuteronomy 3</span> rd ed. (1901), p. xxi. In 1901 the present writer visited Juleijil, and a thorough examination of the site convinced him that it is the Gilgal of our text. A hill, some two hundred feet high, rises from the Makhneh plain just opposite the valley between Gerizim and ‘Ebal. The trace of a broad winding road leads to the summit, which is covered with ancient remains, including those of a large stone-circle composed of huge blocks. There is no more suitable site for a sanctuary in all W. Palestine. Cp. G.

The two mountains named stand opposite to each other, with a valley between, about two hundred yards broad at the widest part, in which stood the town of Shechem, now Nablus. They were selected for the purpose mentioned, doubtless, because of their relative position, and probably also because they stand in the center of the land both from north to south, and from east to west. It has been suggested that Ebal was appointed for the uttering of the curse, and Gerizim for the uttering of the blessing, because the former was barren and rugged, the latter fertile and smooth; but this is not borne out by the actual appearance of the two bills, both being equally barren-looking, though neither is wholly destitute of culture and vegetation. That Gerizim was selected for the blessing because of its position on the south side of the valley "towards the region of light," while Ebal was appointed for the curse because it was on the north side, can be regarded only as an ingenious fancy.

The words, "every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours," are defined more precisely, and restricted to the land of Canaan on both sides of the Jordan by the boundaries which follow: "from the desert (of Arabia on the south), and Lebanon (on the north), and from the river Euphrates (on the east) to the hinder sea" (the Mediterranean on the west; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>). The Euphrates is given as the eastern boundary, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>, according to the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>. (On <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-25.htm">Deuteronomy 11:25</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm">Deuteronomy 2:25</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>.)</body></html>
