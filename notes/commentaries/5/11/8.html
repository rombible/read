Sin tends to shorten the days of all men, and to shorten the days of a people's prosperity. God will bless them with an abundance of all good things, if they would love him and serve him. Godliness has the promise of the life that now is; but the favour of God shall put gladness into the heart, more than the increase of corn, and wine, and oil. Revolt from God to idols would certainly be their ruin. Take heed that your hearts be not deceived. All who forsake God to set their affection upon any creature, will find themselves wretchedly deceived, to their own destruction; and this will make it worse, that it was for want of taking heed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the margin. literally, "every living thing at their feet."

I speak not with your children which have not known &#8230; But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did&#8212;Moses is here giving a brief summary of the marvels and miracles of awful judgment which God had wrought in effecting their release from the tyranny of Pharaoh, as well as those which had taken place in the wilderness. He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents. For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should die in the wilderness, and its execution, extended only to males from twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi, were objects of the denunciation (see Nu 14:28-30; 16:49). There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and advantages of obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore shall you keep all the commandments which I command you this day,....

Either the Sg. is a clerical error which has slipped into the Heb. text and is to be corrected by the Versions; or it is original, and the readings of these are harmonistic, as in A.V. Or, if the Sg. is the correct reading it may be either a mere inadvertence on the part of the original writer, or the clause may have been inserted by an editor with the echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-11.htm" title="You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.">Deuteronomy 7:11</a> in his ear.

The words from "for (I speak) not" to "have not seen" are a parenthetical clause, by which Moses would impress his words most strongly upon the hearts of the older generation, which had witnessed the acts of the Lord. The clause is without any verb or predicate, but this can easily be supplied from the sense. The best suggestion is that of Schultz, viz., &#1492;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, "for it is not with your children that I have to do," not to them that this admonition applies. Moses refers to the children who had been born in the desert, as distinguished from those who, though not twenty years old when the Israelites came out of Egypt, had nevertheless seen with their own eyes the plagues inflicted upon Egypt, and who were now of mature age, viz., between forty and sixty years old, and formed, as the older and more experienced generation, the stock and kernel of the congregation assembled round him now. To the words, "which have not known and have not seen," it is easy to supply from the context, "what ye have known and seen." The accusatives from "the chastisement" onwards belong to the verb of the principal sentence, "know ye this day." The accusatives which follow show what we are to understand by "the chastisement of the Lord," viz., the mighty acts of the Lord to Egypt and to Israel in the desert. The object of them all was to educate Israel in the fear and love of God. In this sense Moses calls them &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; (Eng. Ver. chastisement), &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;, i.e., not punishment only, but education by the manifestation of love as well as punishment (like &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1512; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-36.htm">Deuteronomy 4:36</a>; cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-2.htm">Proverbs 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-8.htm">Proverbs 1:8</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-1.htm">Proverbs 4:1</a>, etc.). "His greatness," etc., as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>. On the signs and acts in Egypt, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-34.htm">Deuteronomy 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-22.htm">Deuteronomy 6:22</a>; and on those at the Red Sea, at <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14.htm">Exodus 14</a>. &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; - &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, "over whose face He made the waters of the Red Sea to flow;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-26.htm">Exodus 14:26</a>. - By the acts of God in the desert (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-5.htm">Deuteronomy 11:5</a>) we are not to understand the chastenings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11.htm">Numbers 11-15</a> either solely or pre-eminently, but all the manifestations of the omnipotence of God in the guidance of Israel, proofs of love as well as the penal wonders. Of the latter, the miraculous destruction of the company of Korah is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-6.htm">Deuteronomy 11:6</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-31.htm">Numbers 16:31-33</a>). Here Moses only mentions Dathan and Abiram, the followers of Korah, and not Korah himself, probably from regard to his sons, who were not swallowed up by the earth along with their father, but had lived to perpetuate the family of Korah. "Everything existing, which was in their following" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/11-8.htm">Exodus 11:8</a>), does not mean their possessions, but their servants, and corresponds to "all the men who belonged to Korah" in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm">Numbers 16:32</a>, whereas the possessions mentioned there are included here in the "tents." &#1492;&#1497;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is only applied to living beings, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-23.htm">Genesis 7:23</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm">Deuteronomy 11:7</a> the reason is given for the admonition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-2.htm">Deuteronomy 11:2</a> : the elders were to know (discern) the educational purpose of God in those mighty acts of the Lord, because they had seen them with their own eyes. </body></html>
