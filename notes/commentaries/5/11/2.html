I speak not with your children which have not known &#8230; But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did&#8212;Moses is here giving a brief summary of the marvels and miracles of awful judgment which God had wrought in effecting their release from the tyranny of Pharaoh, as well as those which had taken place in the wilderness. He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents. For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should die in the wilderness, and its execution, extended only to males from twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi, were objects of the denunciation (see Nu 14:28-30; 16:49). There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and advantages of obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Know ye, </span> i.e. acknowledge and consider it with diligence and thankfulness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And know you this day,.... Take notice of, and diligently attend unto, what is now about to be delivered: <p>for I speak not unto your children which have not known, and which have not seen, the chastisement of the Lord your God; who have no knowledge and experience of the chastisement of the Lord on themselves, or on their foes or friends; and with whom the argument drawn from it could not come with that force, and make that impression, as it might be thought it would, being used with them who had perfect knowledge of it. The Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan render it doctrine, which, being children, they were not instructed so perfectly in as they were who were adult persons, to whom Moses directs his discourse: <p>his greatness, his mighty hand, and stretched out arm: the exceeding greatness of his power, displayed in the following instances. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> know ye this day: for <i>I speak</i> not with your children which have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his stretched out arm,</span><p>(a) You who have seen God's graces with your eyes should be moved, rather than your children who have only heard of them.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">And know ye</span>] For this deuteronomic form see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-9.htm" title="Know therefore that the LORD your God, he is God, the faithful God, which keeps covenant and mercy with them that love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;">Deuteronomy 7:9</a>. <span class="ital">Know</span> what? The defective construction which follows leaves this obscure. Some suppose that in the course of his involved sentence the writer has forgotten the object of <span class="ital">know</span> as well as the verb which should govern <span class="ital">your children</span> (accus. case), and they translate, <span class="ital">know that it is not with your children</span> I speak, <span class="ital">who have not known nor seen the discipline of Jehovah your God</span>; and that the antithesis is reached in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm" title="But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.">Deuteronomy 11:7</a></span>, <span class="ital">but that your own eyes</span>, etc. It is, however, difficult to understand why by a solemn formula they should be called to recognise so obvious a distinction between themselves and their children. It seems preferable either to take the formula absolutely and by itself as A.V. and R.V. do, or with most commentators to read <span class="ital">the discipline of Jehovah</span> as the object of <span class="ital">know</span> and what comes between as a parenthesis.

A Pl. section recalling God’s discipline of the very generation which is being addressed. The change from Sg. to Pl. has been explained on the logical ground that the speaker is no longer regarding the nation as a single whole, but is addressing the adult generation as individuals distinct from their children (Bertholet). This, of course, is possible. Yet the alternative supposition, that some other source is here used by the compiler, besides being probable from what we have seen in other cases of the change of address, receives some support from the broken construction of the opening sentence as though it were a bad joint. It is significant, too, that the resumption of the Pl. coincides as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm" title="Also in Horeb you provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD was angry with you to have destroyed you.">Deuteronomy 9:8</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-11.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Arise, take your journey before the people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them.">Deuteronomy 10:11</a> with a historical retrospect.
