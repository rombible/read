He had gone out from his own country, “not knowing whither he went” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-6.htm" title="And Abram passed through the land to the place of Sichem, to the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the land.">Genesis 12:6-7</a>).<p>Here ends the first portion of the exposition of the Decalogue—that which sets forth the <span class= "ital">relation of the people </span>brought out of Egypt <span class= "ital">to Jehovah. </span>The following chapters set forth the laws of the <span class= "ital">land </span>of Israel—first, as the seat of <span class= "ital">worship </span>of Jehovah; secondly, as the seat of <span class= "ital">His kingdom; </span>thirdly, as the sphere of operation of certain rules of behaviour, intended to form a distinctive character for His people. For a complete analysis of this portion, see the Introduction to this Book. Some modern writers attribute these chapters to a later hand than that of Moses. It is therefore necessary to consider them carefully, not simply as chapters, but in their primary structure and according to their natural divisions.<p>The land is considered as the seat of Jehovah’s worship from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-1.htm" title="These are the statutes and judgments, which you shall observe to do in the land, which the LORD God of your fathers gives you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.">Deuteronomy 12:1</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-17.htm" title="Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you.">Deuteronomy 16:17</a> inclusive.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:26-32 Moses sums up all the arguments for obedience in two words, the blessing and the curse. He charged the people to choose which they would have. Moses then appointed a public and solemn proclamation of the blessing and curse, to be made upon the two mountains of Gerizim and Ebal. We have broken the law, and are under its curse, without remedy from ourselves. In mercy, the gospel again sets before us a blessing and a curse. A blessing, if we obey the call to repentance, to faith in Christ, and newness of heart and life through him; an awful curse, if we neglect so great salvation. Let us thankfully welcome these glad tidings of great joy; and let us not harden our hearts, but hear this voice of God while it is called to-day, and while he invites us to come to him upon a mercy-seat. Let us be diligent to make our calling and election sure.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim - literally, thou shalt give, i. e., "give" utterance to it. On the ceremony see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14</a> ff.<p>Mount Gerizim, barren like Ebal, was probably selected as the hill of benediction because it was the southernmost of the two, the south being the region, according to Hebrew ideas, of light, and so of life and blessing. The situation of the mountains is described more accurately in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>. The words "by the way where the sun goeth down," should run, beyond the road of the west; i. e., on the further side of the main track which ran from Syria and Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt through the center of Palestine. This is called "the way of the west" in contrast to the ether main route from Damascus to the south which passed through the district east of Jordan. The further specifications "Gilgal" and "the plains (rather, the oaks, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a> note) of Moreh," are added to define more particularly the section of Canaanites intended.<p>This Gilgal is perhaps to be found in Jiljilia, a large village about twelve miles south of Gerizim. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26-32.

Deu 14:12), - belong to the main sentence, "that your days may be multiplied," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>). "The promise to give the land to Israel for ever was not made unconditionally; an unconditional promise is precluded by the words, 'that your days may be multiplied'" (Schultz).

For (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22-25</a>) if they adhered faithfully to the Lord, He would drive out before them all the nations that dwelt in the land, and would give them the land upon which they trod in all its length and breadth, and so fill the Canaanites with fear and terror before them, that no one should be able to stand against them.
