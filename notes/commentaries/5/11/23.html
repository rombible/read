Let our hearts be filled with the word of God. There will not be good practices in the life, unless there be good thoughts, good affections, and good principles in the heart. 2. Let our eyes be fixed upon the word of God, having constant regard to it as the guide of our way, as the rule of our work, Ps 119:30. 3. Let our tongues be employed about the word of God. Nor will any thing do more to cause prosperity, and keeping up religion in a nation, than the good education of children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sense is: "Keep the covenant faithfully, and so shall your own and your children's days be multiplied as long as the heaven covers the earth."

Let them therefore impress the words now set before them very deeply upon themselves and their children (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-18.htm">Deuteronomy 11:18-21</a>, in which there is in part a verbal repetition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-6.htm">Deuteronomy 6:6-9</a>). The words, "as the days of the heaven above the earth," i.e., as long as the heaven continues above the earth, - in other words, to all eternity (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-30.htm">Psalm 89:30</a>; Job. Deu 14:12), - belong to the main sentence, "that your days may be multiplied," etc. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>). "The promise to give the land to Israel for ever was not made unconditionally; an unconditional promise is precluded by the words, 'that your days may be multiplied'" (Schultz). (For further remarks, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm">Deuteronomy 30:3-5</a>.) For (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-22.htm">Deuteronomy 11:22-25</a>) if they adhered faithfully to the Lord, He would drive out before them all the nations that dwelt in the land, and would give them the land upon which they trod in all its length and breadth, and so fill the Canaanites with fear and terror before them, that no one should be able to stand against them.

The words, "every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall be yours," are defined more precisely, and restricted to the land of Canaan on both sides of the Jordan by the boundaries which follow: "from the desert (of Arabia on the south), and Lebanon (on the north), and from the river Euphrates (on the east) to the hinder sea" (the Mediterranean on the west; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-6.htm">Numbers 34:6</a>).
