I speak not with your children which have not known &#8230; But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the Lord which he did&#8212;Moses is here giving a brief summary of the marvels and miracles of awful judgment which God had wrought in effecting their release from the tyranny of Pharaoh, as well as those which had taken place in the wilderness. He knew that he might dwell upon these, for he was addressing many who had been witnesses of those appalling incidents. For it will be remembered that the divine threatening that they should die in the wilderness, and its execution, extended only to males from twenty years and upward, who were able to go forth to war. No males under twenty years of age, no females, and none of the tribe of Levi, were objects of the denunciation (see Nu 14:28-30; 16:49). There might, therefore, have been many thousands of the Israelites at that time of whom Moses could say, "Your eyes have seen all the great acts which He did"; and with regard to those the historic review of Moses was well calculated to stir up their minds to the duty and advantages of obedience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In their possession, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">at their feet</span>, i.e. under their power, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm" title="You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:">Psalm 8:6</a></span>, which followed them, or belonged to them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben,....

Without such a recollection, the description of that discipline, especially in view of the alarm it was fitted to inspire, would not be complete. This answers Steuern.’s argument that the verse is secondary, on the grounds that there was no reason to mention specially this one out of all the divine punishments inflicted on Israel, and that with the phrase <span class="ital">in the midst of all Israel</span> the people are not directly addressed, and that the form of the discourse is thus broken. On the contrary, as shown above, the phrase suits the speaker’s purpose, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-4.htm" title="And it be told you, and you have heard of it, and inquired diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain, that such abomination is worked in Israel:">Deuteronomy 17:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-7.htm" title="The hands of the witnesses shall be first on him to put him to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So you shall put the evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-16.htm" title="He shall dwell with you, even among you, in that place which he shall choose in one of your gates, where it likes him best: you shall not oppress him.">Deuteronomy 23:16</a> (17). The event is described in Numbers 16, a passage compounded of JE and P (see <span class="ital">Numbers</span> in this series). This verse partly repeats the phraseology of JE, with some variations (e.g. a different verb for <span class="ital">opened</span>), cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm" title="Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:">Numbers 16:1</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/16-26.htm" title="And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins....">Numbers 16:26-27</a><span class="ital"> b</span> (<span class="ital">tents</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-30.htm" title="But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then you shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.">Numbers 16:30</a> (<span class="ital">all that appertained unto them</span>), <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-32.htm" title="And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods.">Numbers 16:32</a><span class="ital"> a</span>. And, like JE, D mentions Dathan and Abiram alone as the victims of the judgement. Instead of them P mentions Korah. This is another illustration of the consistency with which D follows JE, and was either ignorant of, or deliberately ignored P. It is interesting that Sam. adds to D’s statement ‘and all the men belonging to Korah.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All the substance that was in their possession</span>; literally, <span class="accented">every living thing</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-4.htm">Genesis 7:4, 23</a>) <span class="accented">that was at their feet</span>, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. all their followers (cf.
