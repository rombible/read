The other word is applied to the spring rain, which falls in March and April, because it fits the earth for the ingathering of harvest. Between these two wet periods, and except them, there was little or no rain in Canaan. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. the first rain and the latter rain&#8212;The early rain commenced in autumn, that is, chiefly during the months of September and October, while the latter rain fell in the spring of the year, that is, during the months of March and April. It is true that occasional showers fell all the winter; but, at the autumnal and vernal seasons, they were more frequent, copious, and important; for the early rain was necessary, after a hot and protracted summer, to prepare the soil for receiving the seed; and the latter rain, which shortly preceded the harvest, was of the greatest use in invigorating the languishing powers of vegetation (Jer 5:24; Joe 2:23; Am 4:7; Jas 5:7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The rain of your land, </span> i.e. which is needful and sufficient for your land; or which is proper to your land, not common to Egypt, where, as all authors agree, there is little or no rain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The first rain and the latter rain; </span> the first fell in seed time, to make the corn spring, the other a little before harvest, to ripen it.

Such a quantity of it as the land required, a sufficiency of it to make it fruitful, and that in proper time: <p>the first rain and the latter rain; the former rain in Marchesvan, the latter rain in Nisan, as the Targum of Jonathan; the first fell about our October, which was at or quickly after seedtime, to water the seed that it might take root, and grow and spring up; and the latter fell about March, a little before harvest, to ripen the corn, and swell and plump the ears of it, and make them yield more and better; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>, <p>that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil; which were the principal things the land afforded for the sustenance of men; bread corn, the stay and staff of human life, and which strengthens man's heart, and makes him fit for labour; wine, which is his drink, and makes the heart of man glad and cheerful; and oil, which in these countries was used instead of butter, and was fattening, and made the face to shine, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-15.htm">Psalm 104:15</a>. The ingathering of these fruits were at different times; the barley harvest first, the wheat harvest next, and after that the vintage, and the gathering of the olives; and by means of rain in due season they were favoured with each of these. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That I will give <i>you</i> the rain of your land in his due season, <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.</span><p>(e) In the seed time, and toward harvest.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">that I will give the rain of your land</span>] The Heb. text is evidently due to the same hand which inserted <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-13.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,">Deuteronomy 11:13</a></span>, for it immediately follows that verse, and as evidently the original reading is that of Sam., LXX and Vulg. <span class="ital">that</span> <span class="bld">he</span> <span class="ital">will give the rain</span> <span class="bld">to thy</span> <span class="ital">land</span>, which connects with <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-12.htm" title="A land which the LORD your God cares for: the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.">Deuteronomy 11:12</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in its season</span>, etc.] The agricultural year in Palestine consisted of two seasons, a rainy and a dry. ‘Towards the end of October heavy rains begin to fall, at intervals, for a day or several days at a time. These are what the English Bible calls the <span class="ital">early</span> or <span class="ital">former</span> rain, Heb. <span class="ital">yôreh, the pourer</span>. It opens the agricultural year; the soil, hardened and cracked by the long summer, rainless since May, is loosened, and the farmer begins ploughing. Till the end of November the average rainfall is not large, but it increases through December, January and February, begins to abate in March, and is practically over by the end of April. The <span class="ital">latter rains</span>, Heb. <span class="ital">malḳosh</span>, from a root meaning <span class="ital">to be late</span>, are the heavy showers of March and April. Coming as they do when the grain is ripening, and being the last before the long summer drought, they are of far more importance to the country than all the rains of the winter months, and that is why these are so frequently passed over in Scripture, and emphasis is laid only on the early and latter rains1[129]’ (<span class="ital">HGHL</span>, pp. 63, 64). The annual rainfall is considerable: at Jerusalem it averages over 25 inches, about the same as the annual rainfall in London. Whether it was more copious in ancient times is a question much debated. For this and other details see the present writer’s <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, i. 19, 77 f. The growth of the vine and olive depend, like the ripening of the corn, essentially on the latter rain; and the olive requires the rainless summer for the ripening of its berries (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span> 300).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[129] This has given people the idea that there are only two periods of rain in the Syrian year, at the vernal and the autumnal equinoxes; but the whole of the winter is the rainy season, as indeed we are told in the parallel lines of the Song of Songs: <span class="ital">Lo the winter is past, the rain is over and gone</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm" title="Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites called them Emims.">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The first rain</span>; the rain which falls from the middle of October to the end of December, which prepares the soil for the seed, and keeps it moist after the seed is sown. <span class="cmt_word">The latter rain</span>; that which falls in March and April, about the time when the grain is ripening for harvest; during the time of harvest no rain falls in Palestine. But if they allowed themselves to be deceived and misled, so as to apostatize from the Lord and serve other gods and worship them, the Divine displeasure would be shown in the withholding from them of the blessing, so that they should miserably perish. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And this knowledge was to impel them to keep the law, that they might be strong, i.e., spiritually strong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-38.htm">Deuteronomy 1:38</a>), and not only go into the promised land, but also live long therein (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-26.htm">Deuteronomy 4:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>). - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-10.htm">Deuteronomy 11:10-12</a> Moses adduces a fresh motive for his admonition to keep the law with fidelity, founded upon the peculiar nature of the land. Canaan was a land the fertility of which was not dependent, like that of Egypt, upon its being watered by the hand of man, but was kept up by the rain of heaven which was sent down by God the Lord, so that it depended entirely upon the Lord how long its inhabitants should live therein. Egypt is described by Moses as a land which Israel sowed with seed, and watered with its foot like a garden of herbs. In Egypt there is hardly any rain at all (cf. Herod. ii. 4, Diod. Sic. i. 41, and other evidence in Hengstenberg's Egypt and the Books of Moses, pp. 217ff.). The watering of the land, which produces its fertility, is dependent upon the annual overflowing of the Nile, and, as this only lasts for about 100 days, upon the way in which this is made available for the whole year, namely, by the construction of canals and ponds throughout the land, to which the water is conducted from the Nile by forcing machines, or by actually carrying it in vessels up to the fields and plantations.<p>(Note: Upon the ancient monuments we find not only the draw-well with the long rope, which is now called Shaduf, depicted in various ways (see Wilkinson, i. p. 35, ii. 4); but at Beni-Hassan there is a representation of two men carrying a water-vessel upon a pole on their shoulders, which they fill from a draw-well or pond, and then carry to the field (cf. Hengstenberg, Egypt and the Books of Moses, pp. 220-1).)<p>The expression, "with thy foot," probably refers to the large pumping wheels still in use there, which are worked by the feet, and over which a long endless rope passes with pails attached, for drawing up the water (cf. Niebuhr, Reise, i. 149), the identity of which with the &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3be; described by Philo as &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; (de confus. ling. i. 410) cannot possibly be called in question; provided, that is to say, we do not confound this &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3be; with the Archimedean water-screw mentioned by Diod. Sic. i. 34, and described more minutely at v. 37, the construction of which was entirely different (see my Archaeology, ii. pp. 111-2). - The Egyptians, as genuine heathen, were so thoroughly conscious of this peculiar characteristic of their land, which made its fertility far more dependent upon the labour of human hands than upon the rain of heaven or divine providence, that Herodotus (ii. 13) represents them as saying, "The Greeks, with their dependence upon the gods, might be disappointed in their brightest hopes and suffer dreadfully from famine." The land of Canaan yielded no support to such godless self-exaltation, for it was "a land of mountains and valleys, and drank water of the rain of heaven" (&#1500; before &#1502;&#1496;&#1512;, to denote the external cause; see Ewald, 217, d.); i.e., it received its watering, the main condition of all fertility, from the rain, by the way of the rain, and therefore through the providential care of God. </body></html>
