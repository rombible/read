The law is spiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. We mistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check. That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the good law of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to the charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who would keep from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thought of sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justly against us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not the providence of God. What thou doest, do freely, for God loves a cheerful giver, 2Co 9:7.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is no inconsistency between this and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-11.htm">Deuteronomy 15:11</a>. The meaning seems simply to be, "Thou must release the debt for the year, except when there be no poor person concerned, a contingency which may happen, for the Lord shall greatly bless thee." The general object of these precepts, as also of the year of Jubilee and the laws respecting inheritance, is to prevent the total ruin of a needy person, and his disappearance from the families of Israel by the sale of his patrimony.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. Save when there shall be no poor man among you&#8212;Apparently a qualifying clause added to limit the application of the foregoing statement [De 15:3]; so that "the brother" to be released pointed to a poor borrower, whereas it is implied that if he were rich, the restoration of the loan might be demanded even during that year. But the words may properly be rendered (as on the Margin) to the end, in order that there may be no poor among you&#8212;that is, that none be reduced to inconvenient straits and poverty by unseasonable exaction of debts at a time when there was no labor and no produce, and that all may enjoy comfort and prosperity, which will be the case through the special blessing of God on the land, provided they are obedient.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt lend unto many; </span> thou shalt be rich and able to lend not only to thy poor brother, but even to strangers of other nations, yea, to many of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the Lord thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee,....

This is sometimes said of the language of these people, the Hebrew language, that it lends to all, but borrows of none, being an original primitive language; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-12.htm">Deuteronomy 28:12</a>. <p>and thou shalt reign over many nations: which was fulfilled in the times of David and Solomon: <p>but they shall not reign over thee; that is, as long as they observed the commands of God; otherwise, when they did not, they were carried captive into other countries, and other people reigned over them, as at this day. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not reign over thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">will bless thee</span>] Heb. is stronger, <span class="ital">shall have blessed thee</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">shalt take, but shalt not give, pledges</span>; cp. 8, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/24-10.htm" title="When you do lend your brother any thing, you shall not go into his house to fetch his pledge....">Deuteronomy 24:10-13</a>.

(with the contrast in 43 f.) is peculiar to D among the codes of Israel. It covers, of course, not only the lending of money and bullion (banking proper), but the sale of goods on credit at interest, to other nations. Such a foreign trade appears to have flourished with great profit both to Judah and Israel under the long contemporary reigns of Uzziah and Jeroboam II (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-7.htm" title="Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots:">Isaiah 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-7.htm" title="He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he loves to oppress.">Hosea 12:7</a>). There was large commerce with foreigners under Manasseh: cp. Ezekiel’s name for Jerusalem, <span class="ital">the gate of the peoples</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-2.htm" title="That you shall take of the first of all the fruit of the earth, which you shall bring of your land that the LORD your God gives you, and shall put it in a basket, and shall go to the place which the LORD your God shall choose to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 26:2</a>, LXX), and the king of Persia’s refusal to allow the walls of Jerusalem to be rebuilt lest her former power of exacting tolls and customs should revive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/4-20.htm" title="There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute, and custom, was paid to them.">Ezra 4:20</a>). It is striking, however, that the fulfilment of D’s promise was most fully realised not while Israel remained on their own land but after their dispersion among the nations, from the Greek period onwards. Strabo’s words (quoted in Jos. XIV. <span class="ital">Antt.</span> vii. 2) are a remarkable acknowledgement of the political as well as financial superiority foreseen by D for Israel: ‘These Jews have penetrated to every city and it would not be easy to find a single place in the inhabited world which has not received this race, and where <span class="ital">it has not become master</span>.’ See further <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, i. 370 f., ii. 193 f., 392 ff.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Every third year, on the other hand, they were to separate the whole of the tithe from the year's produce ("bring forth," sc., from the granary), and leaven it in their gates (i.e., their towns), and feed the Levites, the strangers, and the widows and orphans with it. They were not to take it to the sanctuary, therefore; but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>., after bringing it out, were to make confession to the Lord of what they had done, and pray for His blessing. "At the end of three years:" i.e., when the third year, namely the civil year, which closed with the harvest (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>), had come to an end. This regulation as to the time was founded upon the observance of the sabbatical year, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-1.htm">Deuteronomy 15:1</a>, where the seventh year is no other than the sabbatical year. Twice, therefore, within the period of a sabbatical year, namely in the third and sixth years, the tithe set apart for a sacrificial meal was not to be eaten at the sanctuary, but to be used in the different towns of the land in providing festal meals for those who had no possessions, viz., the Levites, strangers, widows, and orphans. Consequently this tithe cannot properly be called the "third tithe," as it is by many of the Rabbins, but rather the "poor tithe," as it was simply in the way of applying it that it differed from the "second" (see Hottinger, de decimies, exerc. viii. pp. 182ff., and my Archol. i. p. 339). As an encouragement to carry out these instructions, Moses closes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a> with an allusion to the divine blessing which would follow their observance. </body></html>
