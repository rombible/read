There is an addition, requiring the masters to put some small stock into their servants' hands to set up with for themselves, when sent out of their servitude, wherein they had received no wages. We may expect family blessings, the springs of family prosperity, when we make conscience of our duty to our family relations. We are to remember that we are debtors to Divine justice, and have nothing to pay with. That we are slaves, poor, and perishing. But the Lord Jesus Christ, by becoming poor, and by shedding his blood, has made a full and free provision for the payment of our debts, the ransom of our souls, and the supply of all our wants. When the gospel is clearly preached, the acceptable year of the Lord is proclaimed; the year of release of our debts, of the deliverance of our souls, and of obtaining rest in him. And as faith in Christ and love to him prevail, they will triumph over the selfishness of the heart, and over the unkindness of the world, doing away the excuses that rise from unbelief, distrust, and covetousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>literally: "Beware that there be not in thy heart a word which is worthlessness" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-13.htm">Deuteronomy 13:13</a> note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 15:12-19. Hebrew Servants' Freedom.<p>12. if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold unto thee&#8212;The last extremity of an insolvent debtor, when his house or land was not sufficient to cancel his debt, was to be sold as a slave with his family (Le 25:39; 2Ki 4:1; Ne 5:1-13; Job 24:9; Mt 18:25). The term of servitude could not last beyond six years. They obtained their freedom either after six years from the time of their sale or before the end of the seventh year. At the year of jubilee, such slaves were emancipated even if their six years of service were not completed [see on [142]Le 25:39].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If thy brother be sold unto thee.

Nor must his emancipation seem hard to the owner: six years’ profit from a slave is double the hire of a hireling (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-18.htm" title="It shall not seem hard to you, when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant to you, in serving you six years: and the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do.">Deuteronomy 15:18</a>).—Sg. throughout. Whether there are any editorial additions is uncertain: the prevailing use of the masc. for slave seems to some to point to the phrase <span class="ital">or an Hebrew woman</span> (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-12.htm" title="And if your brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold to you, and serve you six years; then in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you.">Deuteronomy 15:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever.

Steuern.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The corresponding law in E, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/21-1.htm" title="Now these are the judgments which you shall set before them....">Exodus 21:1-6</a> (see Driver’s notes), also directs the emancipation of a Hebrew bondman after six years’ service, does not mention bondwoman (for the slave-concubine he has a further law, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/15-7.htm" title="If there be among you a poor man of one of your brothers within any of your gates in your land which the LORD your God gives you, you shall not harden your heart, nor shut your hand from your poor brother:...">Deuteronomy 15:7-11</a></span>) but provides (as D does not) for the bondman’s wife: if he has entered service married he takes his wife out; if his master has given him a wife she and their children remain his master’s property; and to his love for his master E adds that for his wife and children as a motive for his electing to remain. The ceremony of binding him to the service is the same as in D with an addition (see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-17.htm" title="Then you shall take an awl, and thrust it through his ear to the door, and he shall be your servant for ever. And also to your maidservant you shall do likewise.">Deuteronomy 15:17</a></span>). E does not provide equipment for the freed slave.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:...">Leviticus 25:39-55</a> (H expanded by P) deals with both the Hebrew and the foreign bondman. The former is not to serve as slave but as a hired servant, up to the year of jubile (when all land returns to its original owners), and then go free with his children to his own family and his father’s possession; nothing, therefore, is said of a provision for him from his master’s goods, nor of manumission in the seventh year. Thus practically no Israelite is to be a slave: one Israelite shall not <span class="ital">rule over another with rigour</span>. But slaves of foreign birth or from among the <span class="ital">gçrîm</span> are their purchaser’s possession for ever and heritable property. If a poor Hebrew sell himself to a foreigner, he may be redeemed by himself or his family, and a scale is fixed for his price, but if he be not redeemed by the year of jubile, he and his children shall then go free. Throughout nothing is said as to the bondman’s wife.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The gradation of these laws, though not so marked as in the case of some others, is sufficiently clear. E’s is the most primitive; D’s dependence on E is probable but not so evident as in other cases; it might be a different codification of the same consuetudinary law. Besides stating the law in his own phraseology (more particularly that of the Sg. address) and pleading motives for it which are characteristic of him (e.g. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-15.htm" title="And you shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you: therefore I command you this thing to day.">Deuteronomy 15:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-18.htm" title="It shall not seem hard to you, when you send him away free from you; for he has been worth a double hired servant to you, in serving you six years: and the LORD your God shall bless you in all that you do.">Deuteronomy 15:18</a></span>), D has the equally characteristic addition about the equipment of the freed slave. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:...">Leviticus 25:39-55</a>, with its addition upon Hebrew slaves sold to foreigners, reflects conditions which may sometimes have happened before the Exile, but were more prevalent only after it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Besides, the postponement of the emancipation from the 7th year to that of the jubile seems to imply that E’s and D’s laws which fixed it for the former had been found impracticable; P (or H?) therefore prolongs the period of service, but compensates for this by commanding that the Hebrew slave shall be treated as a free man (Driver, <span class="ital">Deut.</span> 185). Calvin’s explanation—that the term <span class="ital">jubile</span> is extended to mean every seventh year; or that the slaves to be freed at the <span class="ital">jubile</span> were those who refused enfranchisement in the seventh year and being so fully in their owner’s power needed the Levitical directions for their humane treatment—is impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the neglect of the law see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm" title="This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that the king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people which were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them;">Jeremiah 34:8</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Two other things need to be noted:—(1) The causes by which Israelites fell into slavery were mainly poverty and crime. A man unable to pay the <span class="ital">mohar</span> or purchase money for a bride might serve for her a term of years, like Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-18.htm" title="And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.">Genesis 29:18</a>); a father might sell his children, especially his daughters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm" title="And if a man sell his daughter to be a maidservant, she shall not go out as the menservants do.">Exodus 21:7</a>), either for poverty or from the wish to connect his house with that of an influential neighbour; the insolvent debtor might be sold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2 Kings 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm" title="That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?">Amos 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm" title="Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our children as their children: and, see, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought to bondage already: neither is it in our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and vineyards.">Nehemiah 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-8.htm" title="And I said to them, We after our ability have redeemed our brothers the Jews, which were sold to the heathen; and will you even sell your brothers? or shall they be sold to us?

The slave of an Israelite was a member of the family, who enjoyed its religious fellowship and took part in the rites and benefits of this, e.g. the Sabbath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-12.htm" title="Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD your God has commanded you.">Deuteronomy 5:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm" title="And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates, and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among you, in the place which the LORD your God has chosen to place his name there.">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-12.htm" title="Six days you shall do your work, and on the seventh day you shall rest: that your ox and your ass may rest, and the son of your handmaid, and the stranger, may be refreshed.">Exodus 23:12</a>) and must therefore have been circumcised (P expressly commands this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm" title="And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.">Genesis 17:12</a>). He had sometimes great influence and authority in the household and might marry his master’s daughter, or even become his heir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm" title="And Abram said, LORD God, what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of Damascus?">Genesis 15:2</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-1.htm" title="And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.">Genesis 24:1</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-14.htm" title="But one of the young men told Abigail, Nabal's wife, saying, Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed on them.">1 Samuel 25:14</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-34.htm" title="Now Sheshan had no sons, but daughters. And Sheshan had a servant, an Egyptian, whose name was Jarha.">1 Chronicles 2:34</a> f.). Even the oldest law, though it considers slaves to be their master’s property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-21.htm" title="Notwithstanding, if he continue a day or two, he shall not be punished: for he is his money.">Exodus 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a>), does not allow him to kill them (<span class="ital">id.</span> 20), and if he destroy the eye or tooth of a slave he must set him free (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-26.htm" title="And if a man smite the eye of his servant, or the eye of his maid, that it perish; he shall let him go free for his eye's sake.">Exodus 21:26</a> f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Similarly in Arabia to-day, where the condition of slaves well illustrates their condition in Israel and especially their religious standing. The treatment of course varies according to the character of the master, and in particular slaves seem less well-treated in the large towns. But on the whole the conditions of service in Arabia are good. Snouck-Hurgronje, <span class="ital">Mekka</span>, ii. 12 ff., 18 f.: ‘even the “slave of all work” has no hard time and all are members of the family they serve’: ‘take it all in all the condition of the Moslem slaves is one only technically different from that of the European servant and workman.’ Doughty (<span class="ital">Ar. Des.</span> i. 554): ‘the condition of a slave is always tolerable and often happy in Arabia; bred up as poor brothers of the sons of the household, they are a manner of God’s wards of the pious Mohammedan householder, who is <span class="ital">ammy</span>, the “eme” of their servitude and <span class="ital">abûy</span> “my father.” … The patrons who paid their price have adopted them into their households, the males are circumcised and—that which enfranchises their souls, even in the long passion of home-sickness—God has visited them in their mishap; they can say, “<span class="ital">it was His grace</span>” since they be thereby entered into the saving religion. This therefore they think is the better country where they are the Lord’s free men, etc.’ Musil (<span class="ital">Ethn. Ber.</span> 224): ‘Among the Ṣḥûr and Ḥwêṭât the slave is almost always married to a slave-girl and serves his lord, sleeps in his tent and accompanies him to war and on forays. Also he guards his flocks and enjoys almost perfect freedom; therefore only the very few run away. My escort, the slave ‘Abdallah, told me that he had several times visited his relatives in Egypt, but had always returned to his master, since it was better for him with the latter than at home.’ See further the notes below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Code of Ḫammurabi has this law (§ 117):—If a man owes a debt and he has given his wife, his son or his daughter [as hostage] for the money, or has handed some one over to work it off, the hostage shall do the work of the creditor’s house; but in the fourth year he shall set them free (C. H. W. Johns, <span class="ital">Babylonian and Assyrian Laws</span>, etc. 52).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 12-18.</span> - From injunctions regarding the treatment of the poor and of debtors the transition is easy to the law concerning slaves, inasmuch as it was through the stress of poverty that any became such from among their brethren. The law, as here laid down, is the same as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-2.htm">Exodus 21:2-6</a>, somewhat expanded; the most important addition being that the slave is not only to go free after six years of service, but is to be furnished by his master with the means of setting up a home for himself. The six years here specified are not to be confounded with the years ending at the sabbatical year; they are any six years during which the individual has been in bondage. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This blessing would not fail, if the Israelites would only hearken to the voice of the Lord; "for Jehovah blesseth thee" (by the perfect &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1498;, the blessing is represented not as a possible and future one only, but as one already bestowed according to the counsel of God, and, so far as the commencement was concerned, already fulfilled), "as He hath spoken" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-11.htm">Deuteronomy 1:11</a>). "And thou wilt lend on pledge to many nations, but thou thyself wilt not borrow upon pledge." &#1506;&#1489;&#1496;, a denom. verb, from &#1506;&#1489;&#1493;&#1496;, a pledge, signifies in Kal to give a pledge for the purpose of borrowing; in Hiphil, to cause a person to give a pledge, or furnish occasion for giving a pledge, i.e., to lend upon pledge. "And thou wilt rule over many nations," etc. Ruling is mentioned here as the result of superiority in wealth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-1.htm">Deuteronomy 28:1</a> : Schultz). </body></html>
