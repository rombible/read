But it must be understood of money lent to an Israelite who was in poor circumstances, as appears from verse<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. According to this law, every poor Israelite who had borrowed money, and had not been able to pay it before, should this year be released from it.

The law is spiritual, and lays restraints upon the thoughts of the heart. We mistake, if we think thoughts are free from God's knowledge and check. That is a wicked heart indeed, which raises evil thoughts from the good law of God, as theirs did, who, because God had obliged them to the charity of forgiving, denied the charity of giving. Those who would keep from the act of sin, must keep out of their minds the very thought of sin. It is a dreadful thing to have the cry of the poor justly against us. Grudge not a kindness to thy brother; distrust not the providence of God.

Or the rules to be observed in making it: <p>every creditor that lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; that is, forgive the debt, or free the debtor from any obligation to payment. Some think this was only a release of debts for this year, in which there was no ploughing nor sowing, and so a poor man could not be in any circumstances to pay his debts, but might be exacted afterwards; but it rather seems to be a full release, so as the payment of them might not be demanded, neither this year nor afterwards; indeed, if a person afterwards should be in a capacity to pay his debts, he would be obliged, in conscience, duty, and honour, to pay them, though no reserve was made in this law, which nowhere appears: <p>he shall not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother: he might receive it, if payment was offered, but he might not demand it, or sue for it; or give his neighbour or brother, whether in a natural or religious sense, any trouble about it: the Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it,"his brother, an Israelite;''one of the same nation and religion with him, though he might not be related in the bonds of consanguinity: <p>because it is called the Lord's release; appointed and commanded by him, and was for his honour and glory, as a God gracious and merciful to the poor, and beneficent to those creditors; and which was proclaimed in his name, by the civil magistrate, according to his order; so the Targum of Jonathan,"because the house of judgment, or the sanhedrim, proclaimed it a release before the Lord.''Now this was typical of a release of debts, or of forgiveness of sins, which is an act of God's grace through Christ, and for his sake. Sins are called debts, not what men owe to God, for then it would be right to commit them, and they might be committed with impunity, yea, with praise, since it would be doing what is fit and right, and well pleasing to God; but men are debtors to fulfil the law, and in case of failure, or a breach of it, are bound to the debt of punishment; and these debts are very numerous, and men are incapable of paying them: and by a release of these is meant not a liberty of sinning, nor a freedom from the being or bondage of sin, but from the guilt of it, and from obligation to punishment for it; and is properly the forgiveness of sin, which is expressed by various phrases, as a non-imputation, a non-remembrance, a covering, blotting out, and removing of sin, and here typically a release of debts; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-12.htm">Matthew 6:12</a>, and God only can make it; he is the creditor, sin is committed against him, and he only can forgive it, which he does freely, fully, and at once, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-41.htm">Luke 7:41</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And this <i>is</i> the manner of the release: Every <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> creditor that lendeth <i>ought</i> unto his neighbour shall release <i>it</i>; he shall not exact <i>it</i> of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it is called the LORD'S release.</span><p>(a) He shall only release his debtors, who are not able to pay for that year.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">And this is the manner of the release</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">the word</span> or <span class="ital">law</span> (or as we might say <span class="ital">text</span>) <span class="ital">of</span>: cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-4.htm" title="And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither, that he may live: Whoever kills his neighbor ignorantly, whom he hated not in time past;">Deuteronomy 19:4</a> R.V. <span class="ital">this is the case of</span>.
