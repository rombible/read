It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also in Horeb - Rather, "even in Horeb."

Arise, get thee down quickly from hence; for thy people &#8230; have corrupted themselves&#8212;With a view to humble them effectually, Moses proceeds to particularize some of the most atrocious instances of their infidelity. He begins with the impiety of the golden calf&#8212;an impiety which, while their miraculous emancipation from Egypt, the most stupendous displays of the Divine Majesty that were exhibited on the adjoining mount, and the recent ratification of the covenant by which they engaged to act as the people of God, were fresh in memory, indicated a degree of inconstancy or debasement almost incredible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/9.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Furthermore the Lord spake unto me, saying,....

The words "from the day that thou camest out," etc., are not to be pressed. It is to be observed, however, that the rebellion against the guidance of God commenced before they passed through the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-11.htm">Exodus 14:11</a>). This general statement Moses then followed up with facts, first of all describing the worship of the calf at Horeb, according to its leading features (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-8.htm">Deuteronomy 9:8-21</a>), and then briefly pointing to the other rebellions of the people in the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-22.htm">Deuteronomy 9:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-23.htm">Deuteronomy 9:23</a>).</body></html>
