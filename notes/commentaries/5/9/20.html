It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Israel could not even boast that its heads and representatives continued, faithful. Aaron had been already designated for the high priestly functions; but he fell away with the rest of the people. It was due therefore solely to the grace of God and the intercession of Moses that Aaron himself and his promised priesthood with him were not cut off; just as at a later time, when Aaron had actually to die for a new sin Israel owed it still to the same causes that Eleazar was substituted and the High Priesthood perpetuated (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-6.htm">Deuteronomy 10:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-24.htm">Numbers 20:24-26</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

"The day of the assembly," i.e., the day on which Moses gathered the people together before God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a>), calling them out of the camp, and bringing them to the Lord to the foot of Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-17.htm">Exodus 19:17</a>). The construction of the sentence is this: the apodosis to "when I was gone up" commences with "the Lord delivered unto me," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-10.htm">Deuteronomy 9:10</a>; and the clause, "then I abode," etc., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-9.htm">Deuteronomy 9:9</a>, is a parenthesis. - The words of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-12.htm">Deuteronomy 9:12-14</a> are taken almost word for word from <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-7.htm">Exodus 32:7-10</a>. &#1492;&#1512;&#1507; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-14.htm">Deuteronomy 9:14</a>), the imperative Hiphil of &#1512;&#1508;&#1492;, desist from me, that I may destroy them, for &#1500;&#1468;&#1497; &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1495;&#1492;, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-10.htm">Exodus 32:10</a>. But notwithstanding the apostasy of the people, the Lord gave Moses the tables of the covenant, not only that they might be a testimony of His holiness before the faithless nation, but still more as a testimony that, in spite of His resolution to destroy the rebellious nation, without leaving a trace behind, He would still uphold His covenant, and make of Moses a greater people. There is nothing at all to favour the opinion, that handing over the tables (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm">Deuteronomy 9:11</a>) was the first beginning of the manifestations of divine wrath (Schultz); and this is also at variance with the preterite, &#1504;&#1514;&#1503;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-11.htm">Deuteronomy 9:11</a>, from which it is very evident that the Lord had already given the tables to Moses, when He commanded him to go down quickly, not only to declare to the people the holiness of God, but to stop the apostasy, and by his mediatorial intervention to avert from the people the execution of the divine purpose. It is true, that when Moses came down and saw the idolatrous conduct of the people, he threw the two tables from his hands, and broke them in pieces before the eyes of the people (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15-17</a>; comp. with <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-15.htm">Exodus 32:15-19</a>), as a practical declaration that the covenant of the Lord was broken by their apostasy. But this act of Moses furnishes no proof that the Lord had given him the tables to declare His holy wrath in the sight of the people. And even if the tables of the covenant were "in a certain sense the indictments in Moses' hands, accusing them of a capital crime" (Schultz), this was not the purpose for which God had given them to him. For if it had been, Moses would not have broken them in pieces, destroying, as it were, the indictments themselves, before the people had been tried. Moses passed over the fact, that even before coming down from the mountain he endeavoured to mitigate the wrath of the Lord by his intercession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-11.htm">Exodus 32:11-14</a>), and simply mentioned (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-15.htm">Deuteronomy 9:15-17</a>) how, as soon as he came down, he charged the people with their great sin; and then, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-18.htm">Deuteronomy 9:18</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-19.htm">Deuteronomy 9:19</a>, how he spent another forty days upon the mountain fasting before God, on account of this sin, until he had averted the destructive wrath of the Lord from Israel, through his earnest intercession. The forty days that Moses spent upon the mountain, "as at the first," in prayer before the Lord, are the days mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-28.htm">Exodus 34:28</a> as having been passed upon Sinai for the perfect restoration of the covenant, and for the purpose of procuring the second tables (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-1.htm">Deuteronomy 10:1</a>.).</body></html>
