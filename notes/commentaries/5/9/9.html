It is good for us often to remember against ourselves, with sorrow and shame, our former sins; that we may see how much we are indebted to free grace, and may humbly own that we never merited any thing but wrath and the curse at God's hand. For so strong is our propensity to pride, that it will creep in under one pretence or another. We are ready to fancy that our righteousness has got for us the special favour of the Lord, though in reality our wickedness is more plain than our weakness. But when the secret history of every man's life shall be brought forth at the day of judgment, all the world will be proved guilty before God. At present, One pleads for us before the mercy-seat, who not only fasted, but died upon the cross for our sins; through whom we may approach, though self-condemned sinners, and beseech for undeserved mercy and for eternal life, as the gift of God in Him. Let us refer all the victory, all the glory, and all the praise, to Him who alone bringeth salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Also in Horeb - Rather, "even in Horeb."

As the Israelites were now about to cross over the Jordan ("this day," to indicate that the time was close at hand), to take possession of nations that were superior to them in size and strength (the tribes of Canaan mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>), and great fortified cities reaching to the heavens (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>), namely, the great and tall nation of the Enakites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>), before which, as was well known, no one could stand (&#1492;&#1514;&#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-24.htm">Deuteronomy 7:24</a>); and as they also knew that Jehovah their God was going before them to destroy and humble these nations, they were not to say in their heart, when this was done, For my righteousness Jehovah hath brought me in to possess this land. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a>, &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; is not to be taken in an imperative sense, but as expressive of the actual fact, and corresponding to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-1.htm">Deuteronomy 9:1</a>, "thou art to pass." Israel now knew for certain - namely, by the fact, which spoke so powerfully, of its having been successful against foes which it could never have conquered by itself, especially against Sihon and Og - that the Lord was going before it, as the leader and captain of His people (Schultz: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-30.htm">Deuteronomy 1:30</a>). The threefold repetition of &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-3.htm">Deuteronomy 9:3</a> is peculiarly emphatic.

Jehovah would destroy the Canaanites, by bring them down, humbling them before Israel, so that they would be able to drive them out and destroy them quickly "&#1502;&#1492;&#1512;, quickly, is no more opposed to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-22.htm">Deuteronomy 7:22</a>, 'thou mayest not destroy them quickly,' than God's not delaying to requite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-10.htm">Deuteronomy 7:10</a>) is opposed to His long-suffering" (Schultz). So far as the almighty assistance of God was concerned, the Israelites would quickly overthrow the Canaanites; but for the sake of the well-being of Israel, the destruction would only take place by degrees. "As Jehovah hath said unto thee:" viz., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-23.htm">Exodus 23:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>., and at the beginning of the conflict, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>.</body></html>
