He sets the law before them, as the rule they were to work by, the way they were to walk in. He sets it before them, as the glass in which they were to see their natural face, that, looking into this perfect law of liberty, they might continue therein. These are the laws, given when Israel was newly come out of Egypt; and they were now repeated. Moses gave these laws in charge, while they encamped over against Beth-peor, an idol place of the Moabites. Their present triumphs were a powerful argument for obedience. And we should understand our own situation as sinners, and the nature of that gracious covenant to which we are invited. Therein greater things are shown to us than ever Israel saw from mount Sinai; greater mercies are given to us than they experienced in the wilderness, or in Canaan. One speaks to us, who is of infinitely greater dignity than Moses; who bare our sins upon the cross; and pleads with us by His dying love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These verses would be more properly assigned to the next chapter.

As the kindred verb signifies to solemnly affirm, attest, protest and warn, <span class="ital">‘edôth</span> may mean either (1) <span class="ital">decrees</span> or <span class="ital">edicts</span>, or (2) solemn exhortations.

For thus to date legislation given in Moab forty years after the actual Exodus, was not possible for Moses himself or for a writer contemporary or nearly contemporary with him; but only for one viewing the whole progress of Israel from Egypt to the Promised Land from a very distant standpoint.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Testimonies</span>; ordinances attested and confirmed by God; the word used here (<span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5d5;&#x5ea;</span>, plu. of <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b5;&#x5d3;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;</span>) occurs only in Deuteronomy (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-17.htm">Deuteronomy 6:17, 20</a>) and in the Psalms. <span class="cmt_word">Statutes and judgments</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-1.htm">Deuteronomy 4:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">After they came forth out of Egypt</span>; "i.e. not immediately after their exit, But, as ver. 46 shows, when they were already beyond Jordan" (Herxheimer); literally, <span class="accented">in their coming out</span>: <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. during the process of their passing from Egypt to Canaan; more exactly defined by what follows. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>By this the Israelites were to know and lay it to heart, that Jehovah alone was God in heaven and on earth, and were to keep His commandments, in order that (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;) it might be well with them and their descendants, and they might have long life in Canaan. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "all time," for all the future (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). </body></html>
