What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hero worship exhibited itself in the practice of setting up images of human form as household gods (Penates, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-19.htm">Genesis 31:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-2.htm">Genesis 35:2</a>), or as local and civic divinities: a practice forbidden by <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-16.htm">Deuteronomy 4:16</a>.
