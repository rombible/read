Did we consider what a God he is with whom we have to do, we should surely make conscience of our duty to him, and not dare to sin against him. Shall we forsake a merciful God, who will never forsake us, if we are faithful unto him? Whither can we go? Let us be held to our duty by the bonds of love, and prevailed with by the mercies of God to cleave to him. Moses urged God's authority over them, and their obligations to him. In keeping God's commandments they would act wisely for themselves. The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom. Those who enjoy the benefit of Divine light and laws, ought to support their character for wisdom and honour, that God may be glorified thereby. Those who call upon God, shall certainly find him within call, ready to give an answer of peace to every prayer of faith. All these statutes and judgments of the Divine law are just and righteous, above the statutes and judgments of any of the nations. What they saw at mount Sinai, gave an earnest of the day of judgment, in which the Lord Jesus shall be revealed in flaming fire. They must also remember what they heard at mount Sinai. God manifests himself in the works of the creation, without speech or language, yet their voice is heard, Ps 19:1,3; but to Israel he made himself known by speech and language, condescending to their weakness. The rise of this nation was quite different from the origin of all other nations. See the reasons of free grace; we are not beloved for our own sakes, but for Christ's sake. Moses urged the certain benefit and advantage of obedience. This argument he had begun with, ver. 1, That ye may live, and go in and possess the land; and this he concludes with, ver. 40, That it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee. He reminds them that their prosperity would depend upon their piety. Apostacy from God would undoubtedly be the ruin of their nation. He foresees their revolt from God to idols. Those, and those only, shall find God to their comfort, who seek him with all their heart. Afflictions engage and quicken us to seek God; and, by the grace of God working with them, many are thus brought back to their right mind. When these things are come upon thee, turn to the Lord thy God, for thou seest what comes of turning from him. Let all the arguments be laid together, and then say, if religion has not reason on its side. None cast off the government of their God, but those who first abandon the understanding of a man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare with these verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33-40</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-64.htm">Deuteronomy 28:64</a> ff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

Berth. says that the whole ‘bears clearly the stamp of exilic authorship.’ This is not true of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-25.htm" title="When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:...">Deuteronomy 4:25-28</a>, the threat of exile. After the exile of N. Israel in 721 and the precedents in prophecy for a threat of exile (cp. Amos, Isaiah and Jeremiah), and the notorious policy of Assyria towards subject races, it would on the contrary have been strange not to have found in the pre-exilic deuteronomists, with their prophetic temper, some foreboding of exile. Dillm. rightly says, ‘the threat of exile has nothing surprising in it,’ if we compare ch. 28. But the case is different with the promise contingent on the conversion of the people in exile. In itself it is as conceivable in D as in the prophets (whom it is impossible to regard, as a powerful school of criticism does, as predicters only of judgement), but as Dillm. points out it lies here too far away from the purpose of the exhortation1[115]. Add to this reasons of form, (1) that the <span class="ital">for</span> introducing <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-32.htm" title="For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from the one side of heaven to the other, whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?">Deuteronomy 4:32</a> ff. has no relevancy to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-29.htm" title="But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul....">Deuteronomy 4:29-31</a>, but continues <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-25.htm" title="When you shall beget children, and children's children, and you shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD your God, to provoke him to anger:...">Deuteronomy 4:25-28</a> (see Driver), and (2) the change from the Pl. to the Sg. address—and there is a strong case for taking <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-29.htm" title="But if from there you shall seek the LORD your God, you shall find him, if you seek him with all your heart and with all your soul....">Deuteronomy 4:29-31</a> as a later exilic insertion like <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/30-1.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where the LORD your God has driven you,...">Deuteronomy 30:1-10</a>.

The reason for this prohibition is given in the relative clause, "which Jehovah thy God hath allotted to all nations under the whole heaven." The thought is not, "God has given the heathen the sun, moon, and stars for service, i.e., to serve them with their light," as Onkelos, the Rabbins, Jerome, and others, suppose, but He has allotted them to them for worship, i.e., permitted them to choose them as the objects of their worship, which is the view adopted by Justin Martyr, Clemens Alex., and others. According to the scriptural view, even the idolatry of the heathen existed by divine permission and arrangement. God gave up the heathen to idolatry and shameful lusts, because, although they knew Him from His works, they did not praise Him as God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm">Romans 1:21</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-24.htm">Romans 1:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm">Romans 1:26</a>). </body></html>
