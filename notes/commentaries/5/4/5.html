What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The general entreaty contained in this chapter is pointed by special mention and enforcement of the fundamental principles of the whole covenant <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9-40</a>, the spiritual nature of the Deity, His exclusive right to their allegiance, His abhorrence of idolatry in every form, His choice of them for His elect people.

In point of fact it did do so; for although the heathen world generally ridiculed the Hebrews for what they considered a foolish and absurd exclusiveness, some of the most eminent philosophers expressed the highest admiration of the fundamental principle in the Jewish religion&#8212;the unity of God; and their legislators borrowed some laws from the constitution of the Hebrews.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me,....

Does Moses now refer to laws which he has already promulgated from Ḥoreb onward (so Driver)? Hardly, for the rest of the verse implies the same <span class="ital">statutes and judgements</span> as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-1.htm" title="Now therefore listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.">Deuteronomy 4:1</a></span>. Or is this verse out of place here, and borrowed from an address by Moses after the promulgation of the deuteronomic laws (Dillm., Westphal, Steuern., etc.)? Or is it the mistake of a scribe (Kosters)? Bertholet seeks a solution in the fact that when the Heb. verb for <span class="ital">behold</span> (<span class="ital">re’eh</span>, sing. but Sam. and LXX plur.) is followed by a finite verb the perfect is used even where we should expect a future (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-41.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to Joseph, See, I have set you over all the land of Egypt.">Genesis 41:41</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-23.htm" title="And Ornan said to David, Take it to you, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: see, I give you the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I give it all.">1 Chronicles 21:23</a>). Thus the action in view is represented as if it were already past (for a similar idiom cp. ‘the prophetic perfect’). There is, therefore, no reason to question that <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-5.htm" title="Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the LORD my God commanded me, that you should do so in the land where you go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 4:5</a></span> refers like <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-1.htm" title="Now therefore listen, O Israel, to the statutes and to the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that you may live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of your fathers gives you.">Deuteronomy 4:1</a></span> to the legislation imminent in Israel; alternatively it may include the laws given on Ḥoreb, cp. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-14.htm" title="And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and judgments, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.">Deuteronomy 4:14</a></span>.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-1.htm" title="Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go to possess it:">Deuteronomy 6:1</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 5, 6.</span> - The institutes of Moses were the commandments of Jehovah, and therefore obedience to them was imperative. By this was conditioned the enjoyment by Israel of the Promised Land; and this would be their <span class="cmt_word">wisdom and understanding in the sight of the nations</span>; to themselves it would be life, and to the nations it would convey an impression of their being the depositories of true wisdom and knowledge, so that they should be constrained to say, <span class="cmt_word">Surely a wise and understanding people is this great nation.</span> "The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that is wise winneth souls" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-30.htm">Proverbs 11:30</a>). God's statutes make wise the simple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-98.htm">Psalm 119:98, 99</a>); and they who are thus made wise attract the attention of others by the fame of their wisdom. Thus the Queen of Sheba heard in her distant country of the wisdom of Solomon, and came to him to commune with him of all that was in her heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-1.htm">1 Kings 10:1</a>, etc.); and many throughout the ages who were seeking after truth among the heathen, were drawn to Israel by seeing how with them was the true knowledge of God. Israel was thus exalted because God was nigh to them, ready to hear their cry and to give them what they needed; which none of the gods of the nations were or could be to their votaries; and because, in the Law which God had given them, they had such instruction and direction as no heathen nation possessed. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-27.htm">Deuteronomy 3:27</a> is a rhetorical paraphrase of <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-12.htm">Numbers 27:12</a>, where the mountains of Abarim are mentioned in the place of Pisgah, which was the northern portion of Abarim.
