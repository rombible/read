It is noticeable that the giving of the Law appears to have taken place about fifty days after the Passover in Egypt. Jewish writers associate the Feast of Pentecost with the memory of the event. A similar association, and a contrast between the first and last Pentecost, appears to have been present to St. Paul’s mind in 2 Corinthians 3. The law given at Sinai is the “ministration of death,” and is contrasted with the “ministration of the Spirit”—the letter that killeth with the Spirit that giveth life. (Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/4-24.htm" title="Which things are an allegory: for these are the two covenants; the one from the mount Sinai, which engenders to bondage, which is Agar.">Galatians 4:24-26</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/12-18.htm" title="For you are not come to the mount that might be touched, and that burned with fire, nor to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,">Hebrews 12:18-24</a>.)

Thus the analogy between Israel’s receiving the <span class= "ital">letter </span>of the law at Sinai, and the gift of the Holy Spirit in Jerusalem is still further brought out.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-23 The power and love of God to Israel are here made the ground and reason of a number of cautions and serious warnings; and although there is much reference to their national covenant, yet all may be applied to those who live under the gospel. What are laws made for but to be observed and obeyed? Our obedience as individuals cannot merit salvation; but it is the only evidence that we are partakers of the gift of God, which is eternal life through Jesus Christ, Considering how many temptations we are compassed with, and what corrupt desires we have in our bosoms, we have great need to keep our hearts with all diligence. Those cannot walk aright, who walk carelessly. Moses charges particularly to take heed of the sin of idolatry. He shows how weak the temptation would be to those who thought aright; for these pretended gods, the sun, moon, and stars, were only blessings which the Lord their God had imparted to all nations. It is absurd to worship them; shall we serve those that were made to serve us? Take heed lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord your God. We must take heed lest at any time we forget our religion. Care, caution, and watchfulness, are helps against a bad memory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A full stop should end <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-9.htm">Deuteronomy 4:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm">Deuteronomy 4:10</a> begin, At the time that thou stoodest, etc. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a> then ye came near, etc. Moses, exhorting to heedful observance of the Law, strives to renew the impressions of that tremendous scene which attended its promulgation at Sinai. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. the day that thou stoodest before the Lord &#8230; in Horeb&#8212;The delivery of the law from Sinai was an era never to be forgotten in the history of Israel.

Above all things Moses would have them take care not to forget the day the law was given from Mount Sinai, which was so awful and solemn, when they saw the fire, the smoke, the lightning, and heard the thunder and the sound of the trumpet; all which were very shocking and terrifying: and though the men of this generation were but young then, being under twenty years of age, yet many of them were old enough to observe these things, and which one would think should never wear out of their minds: <p>when the Lord said unto me, gather me the people together;
