As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While a stringent injunction is laid down that the old rule (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>, etc.) must be adhered to as regards animals slain in sacrifice, yet permission is now given to slaughter at home what was necessary for the table. The ceremonial distinctions did not apply in such cases, anymore than to "the roebuck" (or gazelle) "and hart," animals allowed for food but not for sacrifice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 12:16-25. Blood Prohibited.<p>16. ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the earth as water&#8212;The prohibition against eating or drinking blood as an unnatural custom accompanied the announcement of the divine grant of animal flesh for food (Ge 9:4), and the prohibition was repeatedly renewed by Moses with reference to the great objects of the law (Le 17:12), the prevention of idolatry, and the consecration of the sacrificial blood to God. In regard, however, to the blood of animals slain for food, it might be shed without ceremony and poured on the ground as a common thing like water&#8212;only for the sake of decency, as well as for preventing all risk of idolatry, it was to be covered over with earth (Le 17:13), in opposition to the practice of heathen sportsmen, who left it exposed as an offering to the god of the chase.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Take heed</span> lest a worldly mind and self-love make thee rob the Levites of their dues, as afterwards the ungodly Jews did.

"The choice of your vows," equivalent to your chosen vows, inasmuch as every vow was something special, as the standing phrase &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>) distinctly shows. - "Rejoicing before the Lord," which is the phrase applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> to the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles, was to be the distinctive feature of all the sacrificial meals held by the people at the sanctuary, as is repeatedly affirmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>). This holy joy in the participation of the blessing bestowed by the Lord was to be shared not only by sons and daughters, but also by salve (men-servants and maid-servants), that they too might taste the friendliness of their God, and also by "the Levite that is in your gates" (i.e., your towns and hamlets; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>). This frequently recurring description of the Levites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>) does not assume that they were homeless, which would be at variance with the allotment of towns for them to dwell in (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>); but simply implies what is frequently added in explanation, that the Levites had "no part nor inheritance," no share of the land as their hereditary property, and in this respect resembled strangers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, etc.).<p>(Note: The explanation given by De Wette, and adopted by Riehm, of the expression, "the Levite that is within thy gates," is perfectly arbitrary and unfounded: viz., that "the Levites did not live any longer in the towns assigned them by the earlier laws, but were scattered about in the different towns of the other tribes.")<p>And the repeated injunction to invite the Levites to the sacrificial meals is not at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, where the tithes are assigned to the tribe of Levi for their maintenance. For however ample this revenue may have been according to the law, it was so entirely dependent, upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the people, that the Levites might very easily be brought into a straitened condition, if indifference towards the Lord and His servants should prevail throughout the nation. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, Moses concludes by once more summing up these instructions in the admonition to beware of offering sacrifices in every place that they might choose, the burnt-offering, as the leading sacrifice, being mentioned instar omnium. </body></html>
