It has been too much overlooked by recent commentators that the law of Moses has a <span class= "ital">prophetic side. </span>It was given to him and to Israel at a time when they were not in a position to keep it. It was the <span class= "ital">law of the land </span>which God would give them. In many ways its observance depended on the completion of the conquest of the land, and upon the quietness of the times in which they lived. This prophetic aspect was certainly not unrecognised by the Jews, or they would not (for example) have neglected to dwell in booths at the Feast of Tabernacles from the time of Joshua to Nehemiah. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-17.htm" title="And all the congregation of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun to that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.">Nehemiah 8:17</a>.)<span class= "note">[2]<p>[2] And compare the curious position of the Jaw in Leviticus which required them to dwell in booths. It occurs as an appendix outside the regular laws of that festival (</span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/23-37.htm" title="These are the feasts of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings, every thing on his day:">Leviticus 23:37-43</a><span class= "note">).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-8.htm" title="You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes.">Deuteronomy 12:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">That we do here — </span>Where the inconvenience of the place, and the uncertainty of their abode, would not permit exact order in sacrifices, and feasts, and ceremonies, which therefore God was then pleased to dispense with; but, saith he, he will not do so there. <span class="ital">Right in his own eyes — </span>Not that universal liberty was given to all persons to worship how they listed: but in many things their unsettled condition gave opportunity to do so.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:5-32 The command to bring ALL the sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle, was now explained with reference to the promised land. As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses points out that heretofore they had not observed the prescribed order in their worship, because during their migratory life in the wilderness it had been impossible to do so. During their wanderings there were doubtless times when the tabernacle was not set up for days together, and when the daily sacrifice <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>, together with many other ordinances, were necessarily omitted (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a>). This consideration must be carefully borne in mind throughout Deuteronomy. It illustrates the necessity for a repetition of very much of the Sinaitic legislation, and suggests the reason why some parts are so urgently reiterated and impressed, while others are left unnoticed. Moses now warns the people that as they were about to quit their unsettled mode of life, God's purpose of choosing for Himself a place to set His Name there would be executed, and the whole of the sacred ritual would consequently become obligatory. The "rest and safety" of Canaan is significantly laid down <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-11</a> as the indispensable condition and basis for an entire fulfillment of the Law: the perfection of righteousness coinciding thus with the cessation of wanderings, dangers, and toils. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. there ye shall eat before the Lord&#8212;of the things mentioned (De 12:6); but of course, none of the parts assigned to the priests before the Lord&#8212;in the place where the sanctuary should be established, and in those parts of the Holy City which the people were at liberty to frequent and inhabit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Here; </span> where the inconveniency of the place, and the uncertainty of our abode in and removal from several places, would not permit exact order in sacrifices, and feasts, and ceremonies, which therefore God was pleased then to dispense with; but, saith he, he will not do so there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes; </span> not that universal liberty was given to all persons to worship whom and how they listed, but that in many things their unsettled condition gave every one opportunity to do so if he thought good. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here,....

Second Statement of the Law of the Single Sanctuary<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With a different preface from the first, contrasting Israel’s duty after settlement to concentrate on the one altar, not with the practice of the Canaanites, but with that of Israel itself in the time of the wanderings: for the rest substantially the same as the first statement, and like it in the Pl. address, with one doubtful transition to Sg.: see on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-9.htm" title="For you are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which the LORD your God gives you.">Deuteronomy 12:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-8.htm" title="You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes."><span class="bld">Deuteronomy 12:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day</span>] That is in the time of Moses the speaker, and in Moab; but with reference (as the following <span class="ital">vv</span>. indicate) to the ritual practice of Israel during the whole forty years preceding their settlement. There may, however, be also here a reflection of the religious practice of the writer’s own time (Oettli).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes</span>] So with regard to the multiplication of local shrines after the settlement in Canaan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/17-6.htm" title="In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did that which was right in his own eyes.">Jdg 17:6</a>, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-25.htm" title="In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that which was right in his own eyes.">Jdg 21:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But if Israel and even Moses—<span class="ital">we</span>!—worshipped, where every man thought good, what are we to make of P’s account of the institution of the Tabernacle at Sinai, and of its use during the rest of the forty years and of P’s rigorous and exact laws (e.g. Leviticus 17) concerning the ritual? Obviously P either did not exist when D’s law of the one altar was written, or was unknown to its author. Amos agrees with D.
