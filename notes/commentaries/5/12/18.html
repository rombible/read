In all three expiation was the first idea, but in the second of them the act of burning symbolised a further thought, namely, that of offering to God, while in the third, the peace-offering, there was added to both of these the still further thought of the offerer’s participation with God, as symbolised by the eating of the sacrifice. So we have great verities of the most spiritual religion adumbrated in this external rite. The rind is hard and forbidding, the kernel is juicy and sweet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Communion with God based on atonement.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. Feeding on Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>What was sacrifice becomes food. The same Person and facts, apprehended by faith, are, in regard to their bearing on the divine government, the ground of pardon, and in regard to their operation within us, the source of spiritual sustenance. Christ for us is our pardon; Christ in us is our life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The restoration to the offerer of all which he lays on God’s altar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </span>The sacrifice was transformed and elevated into a sacrament. By being offered the sacrifice was ennobled. The offerer did not lose what he laid on the altar, but it came back to him, far more precious than before. It was no longer mere food for the body, and to eat it became not an ordinary meal, but a sacrament and means of union with God. It was a hundredfold more the offerer’s even in this life. All its savour was more savoury, all its nutritive qualities were more nutritious. It had suffered a fiery change, and was turned into something more rich and rare.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> That is blessedly true as to all which we lay on God’s altar. It is far more ours than it ever was or could be, while we kept it for ourselves, and our enjoyment of, and nourishment from, our good things, when offered as sacrifices, are greater than when we eat our morsel alone. If we make earthly joys and possessions the materials of our sacrifice, they will not only become more joyful and richer, but they will become means of closer union with Him, instead of parting us from Him, as they do when used in selfish disregard of Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Nor must we forget the wonderful thought, also mirrored in this piece of ancient ritual, that God delights in men’s sacrifices and surrenders and services. ‘If I were hungry, I would not tell thee,’ said the Psalmist in God’s name in regard to outward sacrifices; ‘Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?’ But he does ‘eat’ the better sacrifices that loving hearts or obedient wills lay on His altar. He seeks for these, and delights when they are offered to Him. ‘He hungered, and seeing a fig tree by the wayside, He came to it.’ He still hungers for the fruit that we can yield to Him, and if we will, He will enter in and sup with us, not disdaining to sit at the poor table which we can spread for Him, nor to partake of the humble fare which we can lay upon it, but mending the banquet by what He brings for <span class="ital">our</span> nourishment, and hallowing the hour by His presence.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:5-32 The command to bring ALL the sacrifices to the door of the tabernacle, was now explained with reference to the promised land. As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While a stringent injunction is laid down that the old rule (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>, etc.) must be adhered to as regards animals slain in sacrifice, yet permission is now given to slaughter at home what was necessary for the table.

In regard, however, to the blood of animals slain for food, it might be shed without ceremony and poured on the ground as a common thing like water&#8212;only for the sake of decency, as well as for preventing all risk of idolatry, it was to be covered over with earth (Le 17:13), in opposition to the practice of heathen sportsmen, who left it exposed as an offering to the god of the chase.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But thou must eat them before the Lord thy God, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose,....

"The choice of your vows," equivalent to your chosen vows, inasmuch as every vow was something special, as the standing phrase &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>) distinctly shows. - "Rejoicing before the Lord," which is the phrase applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> to the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles, was to be the distinctive feature of all the sacrificial meals held by the people at the sanctuary, as is repeatedly affirmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>). This holy joy in the participation of the blessing bestowed by the Lord was to be shared not only by sons and daughters, but also by salve (men-servants and maid-servants), that they too might taste the friendliness of their God, and also by "the Levite that is in your gates" (i.e., your towns and hamlets; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>). This frequently recurring description of the Levites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>) does not assume that they were homeless, which would be at variance with the allotment of towns for them to dwell in (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>); but simply implies what is frequently added in explanation, that the Levites had "no part nor inheritance," no share of the land as their hereditary property, and in this respect resembled strangers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, etc.).<p>(Note: The explanation given by De Wette, and adopted by Riehm, of the expression, "the Levite that is within thy gates," is perfectly arbitrary and unfounded: viz., that "the Levites did not live any longer in the towns assigned them by the earlier laws, but were scattered about in the different towns of the other tribes.")<p>And the repeated injunction to invite the Levites to the sacrificial meals is not at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, where the tithes are assigned to the tribe of Levi for their maintenance. For however ample this revenue may have been according to the law, it was so entirely dependent, upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the people, that the Levites might very easily be brought into a straitened condition, if indifference towards the Lord and His servants should prevail throughout the nation. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, Moses concludes by once more summing up these instructions in the admonition to beware of offering sacrifices in every place that they might choose, the burnt-offering, as the leading sacrifice, being mentioned instar omnium. </body></html>
