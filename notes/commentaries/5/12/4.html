The religion of the Canaanites was human; its modes of worship were of man's devising. It fixed its holy places on the hills in the vain thought of being nearer heaven, or in deep groves where the silence and gloom might overawe the worshipper. But such superstitious appliances were not worthy of the true religion. God had revealed Himself to people in it, and manifested among them His immediate presence and power. He would Himself assign the sanctuary and the ritual of His own service. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

As the revealed God - the God whose being and perfections had been made known, not by a vague revelation of him in nature merely, but expressly by his putting or recording his Name historically and locally among men (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>) - so should there be a definite place chosen and appointed by him where he would come to receive the worship of his people, where he would record his Name, and where he would be known for a Refuge and a Helper to all who put their trust in him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-3.htm">Psalm 48:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/76-1.htm">Psalm 76:1</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-18.htm">Daniel 9:18</a>). The Name of God is God himself as revealed; and he puts his Name on any place where he specially manifests himself as present  (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-29.htm">1 Kings 8:29</a>), and which is consequently to be regarded as his habitation or dwelling-place. Hence the temple at Jerusalem was in later times known as the place of the Name of Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-7.htm">Isaiah 18:7</a>), the dwelling-place of his glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-8.htm">Psalm 26:8</a>). But he is the God of the whole earth, and therefore, wherever he is pleased to reveal himself, in whatever place he makes his Name to be known, there he is to be worshipped. There is no reference in this passage to the temple at Jerusalem specially, as some have supposed; what is here enjoined is only a practical application of the Divine promise, that in <span class="accented">all</span> places where God would record his Name, there he would come to bless his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm">Exodus 20:24</a>). The reference here, therefore, is quite general, and applies to any place where, by the Divine appointment, the tabernacle might be set up and the worship of Jehovah instituted. <span class="cmt_word">Unto his habitation shall ye seek.</span> To seek to any place means, primarily, to resort to it, to frequent it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/1-5.htm">2 Chronicles 1:5</a>), but with the implied purpose of inquiring there for something, as for responses or oracles, when the place resorted to was that in which God had put his Name. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Concluding summary. "I set before you this day the blessing and the curse." The blessing, if (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-22.htm">Leviticus 4:22</a>) ye hearken to the commandments of your God; the curse, if ye do not give heed to them, but turn aside from the way pointed out to you, to go after other gods. To this there are added instructions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-29.htm">Deuteronomy 11:29</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a>, that when they took possession of the land they should give the blessing upon Mount Gerizim and the curse upon Mount Ebal, i.e., should give utterance to them there, and as it were transfer them to the land to be apportioned to its inhabitants according to their attitude towards the Lord their God. (For further comment, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-14.htm">Deuteronomy 27:14</a>.) The two mountains mentioned were selected for this act, no doubt because they were opposite to one another, and stood, each about 2500 feet high, in the very centre of the land not only from west to east, but also from north to south. Ebal stands upon the north side, Gerizim upon the south; between the two is Sichem, the present Nabulus, in a tolerably elevated valley, fertile, attractive, and watered by many springs, which runs from the south-east to the north-west from the foot of Gerizim to that of Ebal, and is about 1600 feet in breadth. The blessing was to be uttered upon Gerizim, and the curse upon Ebal; though not, as the earlier commentators supposed, because the peculiarities of these mountains, viz., the fertility of Gerizim and the barrenness of Ebal, appeared to accord with this arrangement: for when seen from the valley between, "the sides of both these mountains are equally naked and sterile;" and "the only exception in favour of the former is a small ravine coming down, opposite the west end of the town, which is indeed full of foundations and trees" (Rob. Pal. iii. 96, 97). The reason for selecting Gerizim for the blessings was probably, as Schultz supposes, the fact that it was situated on the south, towards the region of the light. "Light and blessing are essentially one. From the light-giving face of God there come blessing and life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/16-11.htm">Psalm 16:11</a>)." - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-30.htm">Deuteronomy 11:30</a> the situation of these mountains is more clearly defined: they were "on the other side of the Jordan," i.e., in the land to the west of the Jordan, "behind the way of the sunset," i.e., on the other side of the road of the west, which runs through the land on the west of the Jordan, just as another such road runs through the land on the east (Knobel). The reference is to the main road which ran from Upper Asia through Canaan to Egypt, as was shown by the journeys of Abraham and Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-17.htm">Genesis 33:17-18</a>). Even at the present day the main road leads from Beisan to Jerusalem round the east side of Ebal into the valley of Sichem, and then again eastwards from Gerizim through the Mukra valley on towards the south (cf. Rib. iii. 94; Ritter, Erdkunde, xvi. pp. 658-9). "In the land of the Canaanite who dwells in the Arabah." By the Arabah, Knobel understands the plain of Nabulus, which is not much less than four hours' journey long, and on an average from a half to three-quarters broad, "the largest of all upon the elevated tract of land between the western plain and the valley of the Jordan" (Rob. iii. p. 101). This is decidedly wrong, however, as it is opposed to the fixed use of the word, and irreconcilable with the character of this plain, which, Robinson says, "is cultivated throughout and covered with the rich green of millet intermingled with the yellow of the ripe corn, which the country people were just reaping" (Pal. iii. 93). The Arabah is the western portion of the Ghor (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-1.htm">Deuteronomy 1:1</a>), and is mentioned here as that portion of the land on the west of the Jordan which lay stretched out before the eyes of the Israelites who were encamped in the steppes of Moab. "Over against Gilgal," i.e., not the southern Gilgal between Jericho and the Jordan, which received its name for the first time in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/4-20.htm">Joshua 4:20</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a>; but probably the Gilgal mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-6.htm">Joshua 9:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-6.htm">Joshua 10:6</a>., and very frequently in the history of Samuel, Elijah, and Elisha, which is only about twelve and a half miles from Gerizim in a southern direction, and has been preserved in the large village of Jiljilia to the south-west of Sinjil, and which stands in such an elevated position, "close to the western brow of the high mountain tract," that you "have here a very extensive prospect over the great lower plain, and also over the sea, whilst the mountains of Gilead are seen in the east" (Rob. Pal. iii. 81). Judging from this description of the situation, Mount Gerizim must be visible from this Gilgal, so that Gerizim and Ebal might very well be described as over against Gilgal.<p>(Note: There is much less ground for the opinion of Winer, Knobel, and Schultz, that Gilgal is the Jiljule mentioned by Robinson (Pal. iii. 47; and Bibl. Researches, p. 138), which evidently corresponds to the Galgula placed by Eusebius and Jerome six Roman miles from Antipatris, and is situated to the south-east of Kefr Saba (Antipatris), on the road from Egypt to Damascus. For this place is not only farther from Gerizim and Ebal, viz., about seventeen miles, but from its position in the lowland by the sea-shore it presents no salient point for determining the situation of the mountains of Gerizim and Ebal. Still less can we agree with Knobel, who speaks of the village of Kilkilia, to the north-east of Kefr Saba, as the name itself has nothing in common with Gilgal.)<p>The last definition, "beside the terebinths of Moreh," is intended no doubt to call to mind the consecration of that locality even from the times of the patriarchs (Schultz: see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/12-6.htm">Genesis 12:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-4.htm">Genesis 35:4</a>).</body></html>
