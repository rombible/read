As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moses points out that heretofore they had not observed the prescribed order in their worship, because during their migratory life in the wilderness it had been impossible to do so. During their wanderings there were doubtless times when the tabernacle was not set up for days together, and when the daily sacrifice <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-3.htm">Numbers 28:3</a>, together with many other ordinances, were necessarily omitted (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5</a>). This consideration must be carefully borne in mind throughout Deuteronomy. It illustrates the necessity for a repetition of very much of the Sinaitic legislation, and suggests the reason why some parts are so urgently reiterated and impressed, while others are left unnoticed. Moses now warns the people that as they were about to quit their unsettled mode of life, God's purpose of choosing for Himself a place to set His Name there would be executed, and the whole of the sacred ritual would consequently become obligatory. The "rest and safety" of Canaan is significantly laid down <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-10.htm">Deuteronomy 12:10-11</a> as the indispensable condition and basis for an entire fulfillment of the Law: the perfection of righteousness coinciding thus with the cessation of wanderings, dangers, and toils. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. there ye shall eat before the Lord&#8212;of the things mentioned (De 12:6); but of course, none of the parts assigned to the priests before the Lord&#8212;in the place where the sanctuary should be established, and in those parts of the Holy City which the people were at liberty to frequent and inhabit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But when ye go over Jordan,....

Whereas the heathen seeks and worships his nature-gods, wherever he thinks he can discern in nature any trace of Divinity, the true God has not only revealed His eternal power and Godhead in the works of creation, but His personal being, which unfolds itself to the world in love and holiness, in grace and righteousness, He has made known to man, who was created in His image, in the words and works of salvation; and in these testimonies of His saving presence He has fixed for Himself a name, in which He dwells among His people. This name presents His personality, as comprehended in the word Jehovah, in a visible sign, the tangible pledge of His essential presence. During the journeying of the Israelites this was effected by the pillar of cloud and fire; and after the erection of the tabernacle, by the cloud in the most holy place, above the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim uon it, in which Jehovah had promised to appear to the high priest as the representative of the covenant nation. Through this, the tabernacle, and afterwards Solomon's temple, which took its place, became the dwelling-place of the name of the Lord. But if the knowledge of the true God rested upon direct manifestations of the divine nature, - and the Lord God had for that very reason made Himself known to His people in words and deeds as their God-then as a matter of course the mode of His worship could not be dependent upon any appointment of men, but must be determined exclusively by God Himself. The place of His worship depended upon the choice which God Himself should make, and which would be made known by the fact that He "put His name," i.e., actually manifested His own immediate presence, in one definite spot. By the building of the tabernacle, which the Lord Himself prescribed as the true spot for the revelation of His presence among His people, the place where His name was to dwell among the Israelites was already so far determined, that only the particular town or locality among the tribes of Israel where the tabernacle was to be set up after the conquest of Canaan remained to be decided. At the same time, Moses not only speaks of the Lord choosing the place among all the tribes for the erection of His sanctuary, but also of His choosing the place where He would put His name, that He might dwell there (&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;, for &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493; from &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503;). For the presence of the Lord was not, and was not intended, to be exclusively confined to the tabernacle (or the temple). As God of the whole earth, wherever it might be necessary, for the preservation and promotion of His kingdom, He could make known His presence, and accept the sacrifices of His people in other places, independently of this sanctuary; and there were times when this was really done. The unity of the worship, therefore, which Moses here enjoined, was not to consist in the fact that the people of Israel brought all their sacrificial offerings to the tabernacle, but in their offering them only in the spot where the Lord made His name (that is to say, His presence) known.<p>What Moses commanded here, was only an explanation and more emphatic repetition of the divine command in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-23.htm">Exodus 20:23-24</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-21.htm">Deuteronomy 12:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-22.htm">Deuteronomy 12:22</a>); and to understand "the place which Jehovah would choose" as relating exclusively to Jerusalem or the temple-hill, is a perfectly arbitrary assumption. Shiloh, the place where the tabernacle was set up after the conquest of the land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-1.htm">Joshua 18:1</a>), and where it stood during the whole of the times of the judges, was also chosen by the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-12.htm">Jeremiah 7:12</a>). It was not till after David had set up a tent for the ark of the covenant upon Zion, in the city of Jerusalem, which he had chosen as the capital of his kingdom, and had erected an altar for sacrifice there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm">2 Samuel 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/16-1.htm">1 Chronicles 16:1</a>), that the will of the Lord was made known to him by the prophet Gad, that he should build an altar upon the threshing-floor of Araunah, where the angel of the Lord had appeared to him; and through this command the place was fixed for the future temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm">2 Samuel 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-18.htm">1 Chronicles 21:18</a>). &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; with &#1488;&#1500;, to turn in a certain direction, to inquire or to seek. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, "to put His name," i.e., to make known His presence, is still further defined by the following word &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1504;&#1493;, as signifying that His presence was to be of permanent duration. It is true that this word is separated by an athnach from the previous clause; but it certainly cannot be connected with &#1514;&#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; (ye shall seek), not only because of the standing phrase, &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1503; ("to cause His name to dwell there," <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-11.htm">Deuteronomy 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-2.htm">Deuteronomy 16:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-6.htm">Deuteronomy 16:6</a>, etc.), but also because this connection would give no fitting sense, as the infinitive &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1503; does not mean "a dwelling-place."</body></html>
