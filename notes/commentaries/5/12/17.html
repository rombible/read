As to moral service, then, as now, men might pray and worship every where, as they did in their synagogues. The place which God would choose, is said to be the place where he would put his name. It was to be his habitation, where, as King of Israel, he would be found by all who reverently sought him. Now, under the gospel, we have no temple or altar that sanctifies the gift but Christ only: and as to the places of worship, the prophets foretold that in every place the spiritual incense should be offered, Mal 1:11. Our Saviour declared, that those are accepted as true worshippers, who worship God in sincerity and truth, without regard either to this mountain or Jerusalem, Joh 4:21. And a devout Israelite might honour God, keep up communion with him, and obtain mercy from him, though he had no opportunity of bringing a sacrifice to his altar. Work for God should be done with holy joy and cheerfulness. Even children and servants must rejoice before God; the services of religion are to be a pleasure, and not a task or drudgery. It is the duty of people to be kind to their ministers, who teach them well, and set them good examples. As long as we live, we need their assistance, till we come to that world where ordinances will not be needed. Whether we eat or drink, or whatever we do, we are commanded to do all to the glory of God. And we must do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to the Father through him. They must not even inquire into the modes and forms of idolatrous worship. What good would it do them to know those depths of Satan? And our inward satisfaction will be more and more, as we abound in love and good works, which spring from faith and the in-dwelling Spirit of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>While a stringent injunction is laid down that the old rule (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-3.htm">Leviticus 17:3</a>, etc.) must be adhered to as regards animals slain in sacrifice, yet permission is now given to slaughter at home what was necessary for the table.

To which some add another tithe, which they call the <span class="ital">second tithe</span>, which they say was taken after the Levites’ tithe was laid by. Now each of these hath its difficulty. It seems this place cannot be understood, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Of the Levites’ tithe; partly, because it might seem a great and wholly superfluous trouble to carry all their tithes up to Jerusalem, and to carry them back to their several habitations for their use; partly, because those were <span class="ital">holy to the Lord</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm" title="And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:30</a></span>, and not to be eaten by the people, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-31.htm" title="And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.">Leviticus 27:31</a></span>; whereas these belonged principally to the people, the Levites being only taken in as accessories to eat with them, as it is here, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm" title="But you must eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God shall choose, you, and your son, and your daughter, and your manservant, and your maidservant, and the Levite that is within your gates: and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you put your hands to.">Deu 12:18</a></span>; and partly, because those might be eaten in <span class="ital">every place</span>, as it is expressly affirmed, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-31.htm" title="And you shall eat it in every place, you and your households: for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of the congregation.">Numbers 18:31</a></span> Nor, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

And that it is one land the same tithe which is spoken of <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-22.htm" title="You shall truly tithe all the increase of your seed, that the field brings forth year by year.">Deu 14:22</a></span>, and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-28.htm" title="Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.">Deu 12:28</a></span>, seems more than probable, both because they are called by the same name, <span class="ital">all the tithe of their increase</span>, and because that <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-28.htm" title="Observe and hear all these words which I command you, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you for ever, when you do that which is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.">Deu 12:28</a></span> manifestly looks back to that <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-22.htm" title="Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so you shall eat them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.">Deu 12:22</a></span>, and because otherwise every third year the Israelites were to pay three several tithes one after another, which Scripture no where affirms, and it seems to make the people’s burdens and the Levites’ provisions too great. For the objection taken from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deu 26:12</a>,13</span>, it shall be considered in its place. And the reason of that difference of place, and why the same tithes were eaten for two years together in Jerusalem, and the third in their own gates, seems to be this, that in the two first years there was a more special regard had to the Levites, who were very much conversant in Jerusalem, where those tithes were then eaten, and in the third year there is a respect had to <span class="ital">the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow</span>, who are mentioned as joint sharers with the Levites in this third year’s tithe, whose occasions and obligations of coming to Jerusalem were not so many nor strong as those of the Levites, and therefore they were to be found generally within their gates, where these were to be eaten. And whereas the objection made before against the chargeable and useless carrying of the first tithes to Jerusalem might be applied here, it is answered there, and it is provided, that when they lived at a great distance from Jerusalem they might turn it into money and bestow it there, Deu 14-26, which both confirms the objection as to the first tithe, for which no such provision was made, and answers it as to this, where such a remedy is expressed. And whereas it may be pleaded on the behalf of the first, or the Levitical tithe, that those tithes were brought to Jerusalem, and that there were store-houses or chambers in the temple appointed for the receiving of the tithes, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-5.htm" title="And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of Israel brought in abundance the first fruits of corn, wine, and oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.">2 Chronicles 31:5</a>,6,11,12 Ne 10:37,38 12:44</span>, it may be answered, that those chambers, being only thirty-eight in number, and each of them, except two, but six cubits broad and twelve cubits long, were altogether incapable of all those tithes, and seem principally, if not solely, appointed for the priests’ tithes, and not for all them neither, but only for so much of them as would serve for the use and necessity of those priests and Levites too that were in the actual ministration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The firstlings of thy herds, or of thy flock.</span> As the tithes now mentioned were not the Levitical, but second tithes, as hath been discoursed; so these <span class="ital">firstlings</span> do not seem to be the first firstlings, which being appropriated to the Levites were not to be eaten by any of the people, except those of or in the Levites’ families, but the second firstlings, which were the first which the owner could dispose of, and which, in conformity to the second tithes, he is required to set apart for this use. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or of thy wine, or of thy oil,....

"The choice of your vows," equivalent to your chosen vows, inasmuch as every vow was something special, as the standing phrase &#1504;&#1491;&#1512; &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/22-21.htm">Leviticus 22:21</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/15-3.htm">Numbers 15:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-8.htm">Numbers 15:8</a>) distinctly shows. - "Rejoicing before the Lord," which is the phrase applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a> to the celebration of the feast of Tabernacles, was to be the distinctive feature of all the sacrificial meals held by the people at the sanctuary, as is repeatedly affirmed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-26.htm">Deuteronomy 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-11.htm">Deuteronomy 26:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-7.htm">Deuteronomy 27:7</a>). This holy joy in the participation of the blessing bestowed by the Lord was to be shared not only by sons and daughters, but also by salve (men-servants and maid-servants), that they too might taste the friendliness of their God, and also by "the Levite that is in your gates" (i.e., your towns and hamlets; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-10.htm">Exodus 20:10</a>). This frequently recurring description of the Levites (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-18.htm">Deuteronomy 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-27.htm">Deuteronomy 14:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-14.htm">Deuteronomy 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-6.htm">Deuteronomy 18:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>) does not assume that they were homeless, which would be at variance with the allotment of towns for them to dwell in (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35.htm">Numbers 35</a>); but simply implies what is frequently added in explanation, that the Levites had "no part nor inheritance," no share of the land as their hereditary property, and in this respect resembled strangers (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm">Deuteronomy 14:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-11.htm">Deuteronomy 16:11</a>, etc.).<p>(Note: The explanation given by De Wette, and adopted by Riehm, of the expression, "the Levite that is within thy gates," is perfectly arbitrary and unfounded: viz., that "the Levites did not live any longer in the towns assigned them by the earlier laws, but were scattered about in the different towns of the other tribes.")<p>And the repeated injunction to invite the Levites to the sacrificial meals is not at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, where the tithes are assigned to the tribe of Levi for their maintenance. For however ample this revenue may have been according to the law, it was so entirely dependent, upon the honesty and conscientiousness of the people, that the Levites might very easily be brought into a straitened condition, if indifference towards the Lord and His servants should prevail throughout the nation. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-13.htm">Deuteronomy 12:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-14.htm">Deuteronomy 12:14</a>, Moses concludes by once more summing up these instructions in the admonition to beware of offering sacrifices in every place that they might choose, the burnt-offering, as the leading sacrifice, being mentioned instar omnium. </body></html>
