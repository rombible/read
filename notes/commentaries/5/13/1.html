A city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-12.htm" title="If you shall hear say in one of your cities, which the LORD your God has given you to dwell there, saying,">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a>).<p>In every case the penalty is the same—death without mercy.<p>Is this law the production of a later age? It may be said to have been more often broken than observed.<p>But there are instances in the history of Israel which seem to require some such law as this in all its three sections. The case of the false prophet justifies the action of Elijah, who took the prophets of Baal from Carmel when proved to be impostors, and “brought them down to the brook Kishon, and slew them there.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,">Deuteronomy 13:1</a></span>. Moses, foreseeing how liable the Israelites, in after ages, would be to be deluded by false prophets, who, under pretence of divine revelations, or communications of divine power, while indeed they were assisted by no other than wicked and infernal spirits, might foretel some future events, or work some wondrous and unaccountable things as demonstrations of their false doctrine, and thereby persuade others to join in their idolatrous worship, here proceeds to show how such false pretenders to divine inspiration might be known, and lays down a law, according to which they were to be dealt with. <span class="ital">If there arise among you — </span>One of your own nation, for such might both be seduced, and afterward become seducers of others; <span class="ital">a prophet — </span>That is, a <span class="ital">false </span>prophet, one who falsely pretends to have received a divine message. <span class="ital">Or a dreamer of dreams — </span>One that pretends some god has revealed himself to him in visions or dreams. <span class="ital">And giveth thee a sign — </span>Foretels some future and wonderful events as a sure sign thereof; as the prophets of Jehovah were wont to do, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/10-2.htm" title="When you are departed from me to day, then you shall find two men by Rachel's sepulcher in the border of Benjamin at Zelzah; and they will say to you, The asses which you went to seek are found: and, see, your father has left the care of the asses, and sorrows for you, saying, What shall I do for my son?...">1 Samuel 10:2-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-3.htm" title="And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign which the LORD has spoken; Behold, the altar shall be rent, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.">1 Kings 13:3</a>. It must be observed that <span class="ital">sign </span>and <span class="ital">wonder </span>here signify the same thing, and comprehend all miracles whatsoever, whether the foretelling of something that is out of the reach of human knowledge, or the performing some work that exceeds human power.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:1-5 Moses had cautioned against the peril that might arise from the Canaanites. Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry among themselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truths and precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved by temptations of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guise of truth; nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but the plain, express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would be a proof of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding specious pretences, they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and follow other gods to serve them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>A prophet, or a dreamer of dreams - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a>.

Enticers to Idolatry to Be Put to Death.<p>1. If there arise among you a prophet&#8212;The special counsels which follow arose out of the general precept contained in De 12:32; and the purport of them is, that every attempt to seduce others from the course of duty which that divine standard of faith and worship prescribes must not only be strenuously resisted, but the seducer punished by the law of the land. This is exemplified in three cases of enticement to idolatry.<p>a prophet&#8212;that is, some notable person laying claim to the character and authority of the prophetic office (Nu 12:6; 1Sa 10:6), performing feats of dexterity or power in support of his pretensions, or even predicting events which occurred as he foretold; as, for instance, an eclipse which a knowledge of natural science might enable him to anticipate (or, as Caiaphas, Joh 18:14). Should the aim of such a one be to seduce the people from the worship of the true God, he is an impostor and must be put to death. No prodigy, however wonderful, no human authority, however great, should be allowed to shake their belief in the divine character and truth of a religion so solemnly taught and so awfully attested (compare Ga 1:8). The modern Jews appeal to this passage as justifying their rejection of Jesus Christ. But He possessed all the characteristics of a true prophet, and He was so far from alienating the people from God and His worship that the grand object of His ministry was to lead to a purer, more spiritual and perfect observance of the law.Enticers to idolatry, being permitted by God to try Israel, were to be stoned to death., <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-1.htm" title="If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder,...">Deu 13:1-5</a></span>, though near of kin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-6.htm" title="If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;...">Deu 13:6-11</a></span>.

A false prophet, a lying prophet, as the Targum of Jonathan; one that pretends to be a true prophet, and to be sent of God, and to come from him with a message from him, a new revelation or doctrine, or in his name, to foretell things to come; the former is chiefly meant. Such prophets did arise in Israel before the time of Christ, and have since arose under the Christian name; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>, <p>or a dreamer of dreams; the same with the prophet, only to be distinguished by the different manner of their having the mind and will of God revealed to them, pretended to; either by vision or by dream, which were the two usual ways in which the Lord spake to the true prophets, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/12-6.htm">Numbers 12:6</a> so that the prophet is one who pretended he had a vision from the Lord, and the dreamer one that had a dream from him, or something revealed to him in a dream; and dreams are sometimes used for false doctrines, vain, deceitful, and illusory; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-25.htm">Jeremiah 23:25</a>. The Targum of Jonathan calls him"a dreamer of a dream of pride:''such persons are generally prompted by the pride of their own hearts to take such a method to make themselves famous and respected among men; and usually bring such doctrines with them which are agreeable to the pride and vanity of human nature: <p>and giving thee a sign or a wonder; for the confirmation of his mission and doctrine; such as Moses wrought before the children of Israel and before Pharaoh. Signs are expressions or representations of things to come to pass; wonders, such as either do, or seem to exceed the common course of nature, or be contrary to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/13.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> dreams, and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,</span><p>(a) Who says that he has things revealed to him in dreams.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/13.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>1–5 (2–6 in Heb.).

These signs, it is assumed, should come to pass; nevertheless, the people were not to listen to the man who gave them to go after other gods. The mere fact that he sought to persuade them to forsake the worship of Jehovah was sufficient to prove him an impostor; for how could one who sought to seduce the people from God be sent by God? The sign which was given to authenticate such a message could only be one of those "lying signs and wonders after the working of Satan," by which his emissaries try to deceive and mislead; and was permitted by God only that their fidelity to him might be tested and proved. They had already received God's message; they had his word; and no teaching which contravened that, however apparently authenticated, could be from him, or was to he accepted by them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-8.htm">Jeremiah 29:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-8.htm">Galatians 1:8, 9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm">1 John 3:1</a>, etc.).

In v. 27, "the flesh and the blood" are in opposition to "thy burnt-offerings:" "thy burnt-offerings, namely the flesh and blood of them," thou shalt prepare at the altar of Jehovah; i.e., the flesh and blood of the burnt-offerings were to be placed upon and against the altar (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-5.htm">Leviticus 1:5-9</a>). Of the slain-offerings, i.e., the shelamim, the blood was to be poured out against the altar (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-2.htm">Leviticus 3:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-8.htm">Leviticus 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-13.htm">Leviticus 3:13</a>); "the flesh thou canst eat" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-11.htm">Leviticus 7:11</a>.).
