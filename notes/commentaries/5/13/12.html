We may fairly assume the abominations done there to have been connected with idolatry, from the allusions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm" title="They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will visit their sins.">Hosea 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-9.htm" title="O Israel, you have sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity did not overtake them.">Hosea 10:9</a>. But the outrage rather than the idolatry seems to have excited the indignation of Israel (see Judges 20, 21). It is noticeable that in the remonstrance with the Benjamites at Gibeah—(<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-13.htm" title="Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial, which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put away evil from Israel.

So shall you put the evil away from the middle of you.">Deuteronomy 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-11.htm" title="And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any such wickedness as this is among you.">Deuteronomy 13:11</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:12-18 Here is the case of a city revolting from the God of Israel, and serving other gods. The crime is supposed to be committed by one of the cities of Israel. Even when they were ordered to preserve their religion by force, yet they were not allowed to bring others to it by fire and sword. Spiritual judgments under the Christian dispensation are more terrible than the execution of criminals; we have not less cause than the Israelites had, to fear the Divine wrath. Let us then fear the spiritual idolatry of covetousness, and the love of worldly pleasure; and be careful not to countenance them in our families, by our example or by the education of our children.
