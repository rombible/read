Here he cautions against the rise of idolatry among themselves. It is needful for us to be well acquainted with the truths and precepts of the Bible; for we may expect to be proved by temptations of evil under the appearance of good, of error in the guise of truth; nor can any thing rightly oppose such temptations, but the plain, express testimony of God's word to the contrary. And it would be a proof of sincere affection for God, that, notwithstanding specious pretences, they should not be wrought upon the forsake God, and follow other gods to serve them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The context and parallel passages (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-7.htm">Deuteronomy 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-2.htm">Leviticus 20:2</a>) indicate that there was to be a regular judicial procedure, and that the manner of the execution was to be by stoning.

Enticers to Idolatry to Be Put to Death.<p>1. If there arise among you a prophet&#8212;The special counsels which follow arose out of the general precept contained in De 12:32; and the purport of them is, that every attempt to seduce others from the course of duty which that divine standard of faith and worship prescribes must not only be strenuously resisted, but the seducer punished by the law of the land. This is exemplified in three cases of enticement to idolatry.<p>a prophet&#8212;that is, some notable person laying claim to the character and authority of the prophetic office (Nu 12:6; 1Sa 10:6), performing feats of dexterity or power in support of his pretensions, or even predicting events which occurred as he foretold; as, for instance, an eclipse which a knowledge of natural science might enable him to anticipate (or, as Caiaphas, Joh 18:14). Should the aim of such a one be to seduce the people from the worship of the true God, he is an impostor and must be put to death. No prodigy, however wonderful, no human authority, however great, should be allowed to shake their belief in the divine character and truth of a religion so solemnly taught and so awfully attested (compare Ga 1:8). The modern Jews appeal to this passage as justifying their rejection of Jesus Christ. But He possessed all the characteristics of a true prophet, and He was so far from alienating the people from God and His worship that the grand object of His ministry was to lead to a purer, more spiritual and perfect observance of the law.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">He hath spoken, </span> i.e. taught or persuaded you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To turn you away from the Lord; </span> to forsake God and his worship.
