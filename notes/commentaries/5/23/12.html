Not only had they failed to give Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), but they (viz., the king of the Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse Israel, according to the infallible word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), the truth of which even Balaam was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>); although out of love to Israel the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>). For this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e., to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>); not indeed from personal hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish, Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-12.htm">Ezra 9:12</a>). How far Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> against making war upon the Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> with reference to the Edomites and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march peaceably through his land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land. Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who had lived as strangers in Israel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Such persons might be incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision. </body></html>
