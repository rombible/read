Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated with particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return to the world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it be honestly and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, but how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrows for necessary food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thy lips, as a solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; only they must not carry any away. This law intimated what great plenty of corn and wine they should have in Canaan. It provided for the support of poor travellers, and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to be ready to distribute, and not to think every thing lost that is given away. Yet it forbids us to abuse the kindness of friends, or to take advantage of what is allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements should mark the people of God; and they should never encroach upon others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another Gentile practice, connected with the one alluded to in the preceding verse, is here forbidden.

Aben Ezra observes, that every vow is a freewill offering, but not every freewill offering a vow; the Targum of Jonathan enumerates the several things to be performed, sin offerings, trespass offerings, burnt offerings, and oblations of holy things, and drink offerings, and gifts of the house of the sanctuary, and alms to the poor. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> keep and perform; <i>even</i> a freewill offering, according as thou hast vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy mouth.</span><p>(m) If the vow is lawful and godly.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the other hand, male and female prostitutes of Israelitish descent were not to be tolerated; i.e., it was not to be allowed, that either a male or female among the Israelites should give himself up to prostitution as an act of religious worship. The exclusion of foreign prostitutes was involved in the command to root out the Canaanites. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; were persons who prostituted themselves in the worship of the Canaanitish Astarte (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-21.htm">Genesis 38:21</a>). - "The wages of a prostitute and the money of dogs shall not come into the house of the Lord on account of (&#1500;, for the more remote cause, Ewald, 217) any vow; for even both these (viz., even the prostitute and dog, not merely their dishonourable gains) are abomination unto the Lord thy God." "The hire of a whore" is what the kedeshah was paid for giving herself up. "The price of a dog" is not the price paid for the sale of a dog (Bochart, Spencer, Iken, Baumgarten, etc.), but is a figurative expression used to denote the gains of the kadesh, who was called &#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; by the Greeks, and received his name from the dog-like manner in which the male kadesh debased himself (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm">Revelation 22:15</a>, where the unclean are distinctly called "dogs"). </body></html>
