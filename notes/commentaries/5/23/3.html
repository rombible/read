It does not forbid their dwelling in the land; and seems to refer rather to the nations than to individuals. It was not understood at any rate to interdict marriage with a Moabitess; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/1-4.htm">Ruth 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ruth/4-13.htm">Ruth 4:13</a>.

Many of the Israelites being established on the east side of Jordan in the immediate neighborhood of those people, God raised this partition wall between them to prevent the consequences of evil communications. More favor was to be shown to Edomites and Egyptians&#8212;to the former from their near relationship to Israel; and to the latter, from their early hospitalities to the family of Jacob, as well as the many acts of kindness rendered them by private Egyptians at the Exodus (Ex 12:36). The grandchildren of Edomite or Egyptian proselytes were declared admissible to the full rights of citizenship as native Israelites; and by this remarkable provision, God taught His people a practical lesson of generosity and gratitude for special deeds of kindness, to the forgetfulness of all the persecution and ill services sustained from those two nations.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This may be understood either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

Of females also, or of all that were born either of such fathers or mothers, as may be gathered from <span class="bld"> Ezr 10 Ne 13</span>, where the children of strange wives were separated from Israel no less than the children of strange fathers. And it is an allowed maxim, that the birth follows the belly. And whereas the children of Rahab and Ruth are produced to the contrary, it may be said as it was before, that these were extraordinary instances, and that God when he pleased might exempt any particular person of them from this curse, though the Israelites might not do so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For ever; </span> so it seems to note the immutability and perpetuity of this law, that it should be inviolably observed in all succeeding ages, and not dispensed with for any merit in the persons, or any pretence whatsoever. But why then should this clause be added only here, seeing the foregoing laws are as inviolable as this? It seems therefore to extend the duration of this exclusion of them from the congregation of the Lord beyond what was said at first, and to be added by way of aggravation, <span class="ital">even to their tenth generation shall they not enter</span>—yea, <span class="ital">even for ever</span>, i.e. they shall never enter, as it is expressed, without any mention of the tenth generation, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-1.htm" title="On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God for ever;">Nehemiah 13:1</a></span>, <span class="ital">that they shall not come into the congregation of God for ever</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord,....
