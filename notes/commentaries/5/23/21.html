This precept is cited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-4.htm" title="When you vow a vow to God, defer not to pay it; for he has no pleasure in fools: pay that which you have vowed.">Ecclesiastes 5:4</a>, but with sufficient verbal variation to prevent its being called a quotation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-21.htm" title="When you shall vow a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not slack to pay it: for the LORD your God will surely require it of you; and it would be sin in you.">Deuteronomy 23:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-23.htm" title="That which is gone out of your lips you shall keep and perform; even a freewill offering, according as you have vowed to the LORD your God, which you have promised with your mouth.">Deuteronomy 23:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Not slack — </span>Not delay; because delays might make them both unable to pay it, and unwilling too. <span class="ital">A free-will-offering — </span>Which, though thou didst freely make, yet, being made, thou art no longer free, but obliged to perform it.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:15-25 It is honourable to shelter and protect the weak, provided they are not wicked. Proselytes and converts to the truth, should be treated with particular tenderness, that they may have no temptation to return to the world. We cannot honour God with our substance, unless it be honestly and honourably come by. It must not only be considered what we give, but how we got it. Where the borrower gets, or hopes to get, it is just that the lender should share the gain; but to him that borrows for necessary food, pity must be showed. That which is gone out of thy lips, as a solemn and deliberate vow, must not be recalled, but thou shalt keep and perform it punctually and fully. They were allowed to pluck and eat of the corn or grapes that grew by the road side; only they must not carry any away. This law intimated what great plenty of corn and wine they should have in Canaan. It provided for the support of poor travellers, and teaches us to be kind to such, teaches us to be ready to distribute, and not to think every thing lost that is given away. Yet it forbids us to abuse the kindness of friends, or to take advantage of what is allowed. Faithfulness to their engagements should mark the people of God; and they should never encroach upon others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another Gentile practice, connected with the one alluded to in the preceding verse, is here forbidden.

Which must be of things in a man's power to perform, and of what are lawful to be done, and according to the mind and will of God revealed in his word, and agreeably to the manner of worship prescribed by him; as that he will offer such a sacrifice, a freewill offering to him, and the like, besides what he was bound to do, or give such and such things for the repair of the sanctuary, or for the relief of the poor; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/30-2.htm">Numbers 30:2</a>.

A slave who had escaped from his master to Israel was not to be given up, but to be allowed to dwell in the land, wherever he might choose, and not to be oppressed.
