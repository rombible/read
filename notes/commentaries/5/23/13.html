A nail or spike, some kind of instrument to make a hole in the ground with, which was fastened to the sword upon their loins; which was to be instead of a spade or mattock to dig with: <p>and it shall be, when thou shall ease thyself abroad; without the camp, in the place appointed for that use, whenever nature required such an action to be performed: <p>thou shall dig therewith; with, the paddle, an hole in the earth: the Essenes used, according to Josephus, to make it a foot deep with a spade or mattock, and to everyone that was newly admitted among them, a little pickaxe was given for that purpose (r): <p>and shalt turn back; having eased nature: <p>and cover that which cometh from thee; their dung, with the earth they dug out of the hole they made. This law was made to preserve modesty and decency becoming men, and not act like brute beasts, as well as cleanliness in the camp, and, the health of themselves and their fellow soldiers; and that, they might not be offensive to the smell, as well as pernicious to the health of one another; and especially for a reason that follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-14.htm">Deuteronomy 23:14</a>; so Maimonides (s) says, the intention of this law is especially cleanliness, and to avoid nastiness, filthiness, and impurities of every kind, that men might not be like the brute animals. <p>(r) De Bello Jud. l. 2. c. 8. sect. 9.

Not only had they failed to give Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), but they (viz., the king of the Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse Israel, according to the infallible word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), the truth of which even Balaam was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>); although out of love to Israel the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>). For this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e., to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>); not indeed from personal hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish, Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-12.htm">Ezra 9:12</a>). How far Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> against making war upon the Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> with reference to the Edomites and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march peaceably through his land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land. Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who had lived as strangers in Israel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Such persons might be incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision. </body></html>
