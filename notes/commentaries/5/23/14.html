In the tabernacle, which moved when the host marched after the camps of Judah and Reuben, and before those of Ephraim and Dan, in the midst of them: this was the position of it while in the wilderness, and afterwards when they came into the land of Canaan, and went to war with their enemies, the ark sometimes went with them, the symbol of the divine Presence; and here it is made a reason why they should avoid all uncleanness, since the holy God, or that token of his, presence, was in the midst of them: <p>to deliver thee, and give up thine enemies before thee: to save them from falling into the hands of their enemies, and to deliver their enemies into their hands, which depended not upon their numbers, strength, and skill, but on the Presence, providence, and power of God with them; wherefore, as the above writer (t) observes, by these actions (of purity and cleanliness) God meant to confirm the faith of those that engaged in war, that the divine Majesty dwelt among them; for which reason such orders were strictly to be observed by them: <p>therefore shall thy camp be holy; both in a moral and ceremonial sense: <p>that he see no unclean thing in thee; whether natural, moral, or ceremonial; the word here used signifies such nakedness as is forbidden to be uncovered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-6.htm">Leviticus 18:6</a>. Hence Maimonides (u) applies it to whoredom; for he says,"by this phrase God meant to deter and dehort from whoredom, which is too usual and common among soldiers, as long as they are absent from their own houses; that therefore we may be delivered and abstain from those impure works, God has commanded such things to be done, which may bring to our remembrance that his glory dwells in the midst of us:" <p>and turn away from thee; and so they fall into the hands of their enemies, and become an easy prey to them, their God having forsaken them; and that this might not be their case, care should be taken not to offend him, and cause him to depart from them. <p>(t) Moreh Nevochim, par. 3. c. 41.

Not only had they failed to give Israel a hospitable reception on its journey (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), but they (viz., the king of the Moabites) had even hired Balaam to curse Israel. In this way they had brought upon themselves the curse which falls upon all those who curse Israel, according to the infallible word of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-3.htm">Genesis 12:3</a>), the truth of which even Balaam was obliged to attest in the presence of Balak (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-9.htm">Numbers 24:9</a>); although out of love to Israel the Lord turned the curse of Balaam into a blessing (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22.htm">Numbers 22-24</a>). For this reason Israel was never to seek their welfare and prosperity, i.e., to make this an object of its care ("to seek," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm">Jeremiah 29:7</a>); not indeed from personal hatred, for the purpose of repaying evil with evil, since this neither induced Moses to publish the prohibition, nor instigated Ezra when he put the law in force, by compelling the separation of all Ammonitish, Moabitish, and Canaanitish wives from the newly established congregation in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-12.htm">Ezra 9:12</a>). How far Moses was from being influenced by such motives of personal or national revenge is evident, apart from the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> against making war upon the Moabites and Ammonites, from the command which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-8.htm">Deuteronomy 23:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-9.htm">Deuteronomy 23:9</a> with reference to the Edomites and Egyptians. These nations had also manifested hostility to the Israelites. Edom had come against them when they desired to march peaceably through his land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.), and the Pharaohs of Egypt had heavily oppressed them. Nevertheless, Israel as to keep the bond of kindred sacred ("he is thy brother"), and not to forget in the case of the Egyptians the benefits derived from their sojourn in their land. Their children might come into the congregation of the Lord in the third generation, i.e., the great-grandchildren of Edomites of Egyptians, who had lived as strangers in Israel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>). Such persons might be incorporated into the covenant nation by circumcision. </body></html>
