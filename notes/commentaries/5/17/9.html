Moses seems to intimate, that the Hebrew commonwealth was to retain, after his death, the same form as it had now when he was alive; for he himself was the supreme judge, or administrator of justice, to whom the more difficult causes were to be referred, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-17.htm" title="You shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the small as well as the great; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, bring it to me, and I will hear it.">Deuteronomy 1:17</a>.

"The judge" would no doubt usually be a layman, and thus the court would contain both an ecclesiastical and a civil element.

The Priests and Judges to Determine Controversies.<p>8-13. If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment&#8212;In all civil or criminal cases, where there was any doubt or difficulty in giving a decision, the local magistrates were to submit them by reference to the tribunal of the Sanhedrim&#8212;the supreme council, which was composed partly of civil and partly of ecclesiastical persons. "The priests and Levites," should rather be "the priests&#8212;the Levites"; that is, the Levitical priests, including the high priest, who were members of the legislative assembly; and who, as forming one body, are called "the judge." Their sittings were held in the neighborhood of the sanctuary because in great emergencies the high priest had to consult God by Urim (Nu 27:21). From their judgment there was no appeal; and if a person were so perverse and refractory as to refuse obedience to their sentences, his conduct, as inconsistent with the maintenance of order and good government, was then to be regarded and punished as a capital crime.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto the priests the Levites, </span> i.e. unto the great council, which it is here denominated from, because it consisted chiefly of the priests and Levites, as being the best expositors of the laws of God, by which all those controversies mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deu 17:8</a></span> were to be decided. And the high priest was commonly one of that number, and may seem to be understood here under the priests, whereof he was the chief. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unto the judge:</span> this judge here is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The supreme civil magistrate, who was made by God the keeper of both tables, and was by his office to take care of the right administration both of justice and of religion, who was to determine causes and suits by his own skill and authority in civil matters, and by the priests’ direction in spiritual or sacred causes. But this seems obnoxious to some difficulties, because, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. This judge was obliged to dwell in the place of God’s worship, which the civil magistrate was not, and ofttimes did not. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. This judge was one whose office it was to expound and teach others the law of God, as it here follows, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm" title="According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach you, and according to the judgment which they shall tell you, you shall do: you shall not decline from the sentence which they shall show you, to the right hand, nor to the left.">Deu 17:11</a></span>, therefore not the civil magistrate. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The high priest, who was obliged to live in this place, to whom it belonged to determine some at least of those controversies mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm" title="If there arise a matter too hard for you in judgment, between blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and stroke, being matters of controversy within your gates: then shall you arise, and get you up into the place which the LORD your God shall choose;">Deu 17:8</a></span>, and to teach and expound the law of God. And he may be distinctly named, though he be one of the priests, partly because of his eminency and superiority over the rest of them, as after <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">all David’s enemies Saul</span> is particularly mentioned, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-1.htm" title="I will love you, O LORD, my strength.">Psalm 18:1</a></span>; and partly to show that amongst the priests he especially was to be consulted in such cases. But this also seems liable to objections. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That he seems to be included under that general expression of the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">priests and Levites.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That the high priest is never in all the Scripture called simply the judge, but generally called the priest, or the <span class="ital">high priest</span>, or <span class="ital">chief priest</span>, or the like; and it is most probable if Moses had meant him here, he would have expressed him by some of his usual names and titles, and not by a strange title which was not likely to be understood. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That divers controversies between <span class="ital">blood and blood, plea and plea</span>, <span class="ital">stroke and stroke</span>, were not to be determined by the high priest, but by other persons, as appears by <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-22.htm" title="And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to you, but every small matter they shall judge: so shall it be easier for yourself, and they shall bear the burden with you.">Exodus 18:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-16.htm" title="And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the causes between your brothers, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.">Deu 1:16</a>,17</span>. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The sanhedrim or supreme council, which, as was said before, consisted partly of priests, and partly of wise and learned persons of other tribes, as is confessed by all the Jewish and most other writers. And so this is added by way of explication, partly to show that the <span class="ital">priests and Levites</span> here mentioned, as the persons to whom all hard controversies are to be referred, are not all the priests and Levites which should reside in Jerusalem, but only such of them as were or should be members of that great council by whom, together with their fellow-members of other tribes, these causes were to be decided; partly to intimate that that great council, which had the chief and final determination of all the above-said controversies, was a mixed assembly, consisting of wise and good men, some ecclesiastical, and some secular; as it was most meet it should be, because many of the causes which were brought unto them were mixed causes. As for the conjunctive particle <span class="ital">and</span>, that may be taken either disjunctively for or, as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm" title="And he that smites his father, or his mother, shall be surely put to death.">Exodus 21:15</a>,17</span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-4.htm" title="For God commanded, saying, Honor your father and mother: and, He that curses father or mother, let him die the death.">Matthew 15:4</a></span>; and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-5.htm" title="And you shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the middle: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.">Numbers 35:5</a>,6</span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm" title="Or have found that which was lost, and lies concerning it, and swears falsely; in any of all these that a man does, sinning therein:">Leviticus 6:3</a>,5 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-19.htm" title="And Asahel pursued after Abner; and in going he turned not to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.">2 Samuel 2:19</a>,21</span>; or exegetically, for <span class="ital">that is</span>, or to wit, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm" title="And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them the waters to Bethbarah and Jordan.

And though the word <span class="ital">judge</span> be in the singular number, and may seem to denote one person, yet it is only an enallage, or change of the number, the singular for the plural, <span class="ital">judges</span>, which is most frequent, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-2.htm" title="And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden:">Genesis 3:2</a>,7 49:6 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines fought against Israel: and the men of Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain in mount Gilboa.">1 Samuel 31:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-22.htm" title="For the king had at sea a navy of Tharshish with the navy of Hiram: once in three years came the navy of Tharshish, bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">1 Kings 10:22</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-10.htm" title="And to the captains over hundreds did the priest give king David's spears and shields, that were in the temple of the LORD.">2 Kings 11:10</a></span>, compared with <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/9-21.htm" title="For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.">2 Chronicles 9:21</a> 23:9</span> and in the Hebrew, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-42.htm" title="And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah, and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.">1 Chronicles 4:42</a></span>, where divers officers are called one <span class="ital">head</span>. And so it is most probably here, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the following words Which belong to this run altogether in the plural number, <span class="ital">they, they, they</span>, &c., here and <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-10.htm" title="And you shall do according to the sentence, which they of that place which the LORD shall choose shall show you; and you shall observe to do according to all that they inform you:">Deu 17:10</a>,11</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because here is the same enallage in the other branch, the same person or persons being called <span class="ital">the priests here</span>, and <span class="ital">the priest</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm" title="And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not listen to the priest that stands to minister there before the LORD your God, or to the judge, even that man shall die: and you shall put away the evil from Israel.">Deu 17:12</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.
