The English conveys the right sense of the word, which primarily denotes repetition. In Hebrew it is <span class= "ital">Mishneh, </span>the name afterwards given to the “text” of the Talmud, of which the idea is to repeat the law; though it is a somewhat peculiar repetition, in which <span class= "ital">minutiœ </span>are chiefly dealt with, and weightier matters left out.<p>There are traces of this direction (1) in the coronation of Joash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-11.htm" title="Then they brought out the king's son, and put on him the crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king.

And Shaphan read it before the king.">2Chronicles 34:18</a>), and in the effect of the perusal of it upon that king. But it is singular that we do not hear of the Book of the Law in connection with David and Solomon. Possibly, as David was a prophet himself, and not only a king, it may be thought unnecessary to make special mention of his study of the law. In many things he acted upon the direct commands of God to himself or to his seers.<p>We must not forget that the true king of Israel is He whose special mission it was “to fulfil the law and the prophets.” “Lo, I come, <span class= "ital">in the volume of the book it is written of </span>me, I delight to do thy will, O my God: <span class= "ital">yea, thy law is within my heart.”</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/17-18.htm" title="And it shall be, when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book out of that which is before the priests the Levites:...">Deuteronomy 17:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">He shall write — </span>With his own hand, say the Jews. <span class="ital">Out of that which is before the priests — </span>Out of that original, which was carefully kept by the priests in the sanctuary, that it might be a perfect copy, and that it might have the greater influence upon him, coming to him as from the hand and presence of God. <span class="ital">He shall read therein — </span>Diligently and constantly: neither the greatness of his place, nor the weight and multitude of his business, shall excuse or hinder him; <span class="ital">all the days of his life </span>— It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, yea, use them daily.

Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, a prophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it, should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for the prince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing that would turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures, are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in high stations; against these the king is here warned. The king must carefully study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having a copy of the Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all the days of his life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, use them daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till they come to that world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. The king's writing and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise what he wrote and read. And those who fear God and keep his commandments, will fare the better for it even in this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It is in striking consistency with the dignity which everywhere throughout the Mosaic legislation surrounds the chosen people of God, that even if they will be "like as all the nations about" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-14.htm">Deuteronomy 17:14</a>, and be governed by a king, care should nevertheless be taken that he shall be no Oriental despot.

When he is settled on it, and is even amidst all the pomp and glory of it: that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book; which copy the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions interpret of this book of Deuteronomy, which is a summary abstract and repetition of the various laws of God to the people of Israel; though the Jewish writers commonly understand it of the whole Pentateuch, the five books of Moses; which perhaps may be enlarging it too much, as it would be reducing it to too little to restrain it to this law concerning kings, as the Targum of Jonathan. The word "Mishneh", rendered "copy", signifies "double"; hence some take it to mean a double exemplar or copy of the law he was obliged to write out, whereby it would be the more imprinted on his mind, and he would be furnished with it for his use at home and abroad, as the Jewish writers observe; so Jarchi by the copy understands two books of the law, one to be left in his treasury, the other to go out and in with him. The same is said in the Talmud (m), and with which Maimonides (n) agrees, whose words are,"at the time a king sits on the throne of his kingdom, he writes for himself a book of the law, besides what his fathers left him; and he copies it out of the book of the court by the order of the sanhedrim of seventy one; if his fathers have left him none, or it is lost, he writes two books of the law, one he leaves in the house of his treasures, which he is commanded, as everyone of Israel is, and the second never departs from him;''but one may seem sufficient on all occasions, and for all purposes; and this was to be wrote out of that which is before the priests and Levites; the original copy of it, which was deposited in the side of the ark; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>. <p>(m) T.
