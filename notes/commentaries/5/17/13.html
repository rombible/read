The Priests and Judges to Determine Controversies.<p>8-13. If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment&#8212;In all civil or criminal cases, where there was any doubt or difficulty in giving a decision, the local magistrates were to submit them by reference to the tribunal of the Sanhedrim&#8212;the supreme council, which was composed partly of civil and partly of ecclesiastical persons. "The priests and Levites," should rather be "the priests&#8212;the Levites"; that is, the Levitical priests, including the high priest, who were members of the legislative assembly; and who, as forming one body, are called "the judge." Their sittings were held in the neighborhood of the sanctuary because in great emergencies the high priest had to consult God by Urim (Nu 27:21). From their judgment there was no appeal; and if a person were so perverse and refractory as to refuse obedience to their sentences, his conduct, as inconsistent with the maintenance of order and good government, was then to be regarded and punished as a capital crime.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people shall hear, and fear,....

On the testimony of two or three witnesses, not of one only, he was to be put to death (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-30.htm">Numbers 35:30</a>); and the hand of the witnesses was to be against him first to put him to death, i.e., to throw the first stones at him, and all the people were to follow. With regard to the different kinds of idolatry in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>.

"Bring him out to thy gates," i.e., to one of the gates of the town in which the crime was committed. By the gates we are to understand the open space near the gates, where the judicial proceedings took place (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>; Job.

The infliction of punishment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-5.htm">Deuteronomy 17:5</a>. is like that prescribed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-10.htm">Deuteronomy 13:10-11</a>, for those who tempted others to idolatry; with this exception, that the testimony of more than one witness was required before the sentence could be executed, and the witnesses were to be the first to lift up their hands against the criminal to stone him, that they might thereby give a practical proof of the truth of their statement, and their own firm conviction that the condemned was deserving of death, -  "a rule which would naturally lead to the supposition that no man would come forward as a witness without the fullest certainty or the greatest depravity" (Schnell, das isr. Recht).<p>(Note: "He assigned this part to the witnesses, chiefly because there are so many whose tongue is so slippery, not to say good for nothing, that they would boldly strangle a man with their words, when they would not dare to touch him with one of their fingers.
