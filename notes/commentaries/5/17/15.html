Accordingly, when the people desired a king, they applied to Samuel, a prophet of the Lord. In all cases, God's choice, if we can but know it, should direct, determine, and overrule ours. Laws are given for the prince that should be elected. He must carefully avoid every thing that would turn him from God and religion. Riches, honours, and pleasures, are three great hinderances of godliness, (the lusts of the flesh, the lusts of the eye, and the pride of life,) especially to those in high stations; against these the king is here warned. The king must carefully study the law of God, and make that his rule; and having a copy of the Scriptures of his own writing, must read therein all the days of his life. It is not enough to have Bibles, but we must use them, use them daily, as long as we live. Christ's scholars never learn above their Bibles, but will have constant occasion for them, till they come to that world where knowledge and love will be made perfect. The king's writing and reading were as nothing, if he did not practise what he wrote and read. And those who fear God and keep his commandments, will fare the better for it even in this world.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The king, like the judges and officers (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>), is to be chosen by the people; but their choice is to be in accordance with the will of God, and to be made from among "their brethren."

The Jews take this to be a command to set a king over them: whereas it is only a permission in case they should desire and determine on having one, as God foresaw they would; and this with a limitation and restriction to appoint none but whom God should choose, and which was their duty and interest to attend unto; for none could choose better for them, and was what he had a right unto, and it became them to submit to it, since he was their King in a civil and special sense, and another was only his viceregent; accordingly we find, when they expressed their desire to have a king in the time of Samuel, and it was granted, though not without some resentment, the Lord chose their first king for them, Saul, and, after him, David, and even Solomon, David's son; and though, in later times, they appointed kings without consulting him, it is complained of, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a> hence this clause is prefaced in the Targum of Jonathan, <p>"ye shall seek instruction from the Lord, and after set him king, &amp;c.''which was to be done by the mouth of a prophet, or by Urim, as Aben Ezra observes: <p>one from among thy brethren shall thou set king over thee: that is, one of their own nation, an Israelite, a brother both by nation and religion: <p>thou mayest not set a stranger over thee that is not thy brother; one of another nation, that is not of the family of Israel, as Aben Ezra notes, even not an Edomite, though called sometimes their brother; and Herod, who was an Idumean, was set up, not by them, but by the Romans; now in this their king was a type of the King Messiah, of whom it is said, "their nobles shall be of themselves", <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-21.htm">Jeremiah 30:21</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou shalt in any wise set <i>him</i> king over thee, whom the LORD thy God shall choose: <i>one</i> from among thy brethren shalt thou set king over thee: thou mayest not set a <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> stranger over thee, which <i>is</i> not thy brother.</span><p>(i) Who is not from your nation, lest he change true religion into idolatry, and bring you to slavery.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/17.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">thou shalt in any wise set</span>] The emphatic Heb. means either <span class="ital">thou mayest certainly</span>, or <span class="ital">thou shalt only, set</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thy God shall choose</span>] So of Saul and David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-15.htm" title="Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul came, saying,">1 Samuel 9:15</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm" title="And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?

In what way this was to be exercised, and how it was subject to the Divine choice, is not declared. Judging from what actually happened in subsequent history, it would appear that only on special occasions, such as the election of the first king or a change of dynasty, did God take the initiative, and through a prophet direct the choice of the people; ultimately the monarchy became hereditary, and it was understood that the prince who succeeded to the throne did so with the Divine approval, unless the opposite was expressly intimated by a message from God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Higher Judicial Court at the Place of the Sanctuary. - Just as the judges appointed at Sinai were to bring to Moses whatever cases were too difficult for them to decide, that he might judge them according to the decision of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-26.htm">Exodus 18:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-19.htm">Exodus 18:19</a>); so in the future the judges of the different towns were to bring all difficult cases, which they were unable to decide, before the Levitical priests and judges at the place of the sanctuary, that a final decision might be given there.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8-9</a><p>"If there is to thee a matter too marvellous for judgment (&#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488; with &#1502;&#1503;, too wonderful, incomprehensible, or beyond carrying out, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/18-14.htm">Genesis 18:14</a>, i.e., too difficult to give a judicial decision upon), between blood and blood, plea and plea, stroke and stroke (i.e., too hard for you to decide according to what legal provisions a fatal blow, or dispute on some civil matter, or a bodily injury, is to be settled), disputes in thy gates (a loosely arranged apposition in this sense, dispute of different kinds, such as shall arise in thy towns); arise, and get thee to the place which Jehovah thy God shall choose; and go to the Levitical priest and the judge that shall be in those days, and inquire." Israel is addressed here as a nation, but the words are not to be supposed to be directed "first of all to the local courts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>), and lastly to the contending parties" (Knobel), nor "directly to the parties to the suit" (Schultz), but simply to the persons whose duty it was to administer justice in the nation, i.e., to the regular judges in the different towns and districts of the land. This is evident from the general fact, that the Mosaic law never recognises any appeal to higher courts by the different parties to a lawsuit, and that in this case also it is not assumed, since all that is enjoined is, that if the matter should be too difficult for the local judges to decide, they themselves were to carry it to the superior court. As Oehler has quite correctly observed in Herzog's Cyclopaedia, "this superior court was not a court of appeal; for it did not adjudicate after the local court had already given a verdict, but in cases in which the latter would not trust itself to give a verdict at all." And this is more especially evident from what is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-10.htm">Deuteronomy 17:10</a>, with regard to the decisions of the superior court, namely, that they were to do whatever the superior judges taught, without deviating to the right hand or to the left. This is unquestionably far more applicable to the judges of the different towns, who were to carry out exactly the sentence of the higher tribunal, than to the parties to the suit, inasmuch as the latter, at all events those who were condemned for blood (i.e., for murder), could not possibly be in a position to alter the decision of the court at pleasure, since it did not rest with them, but with the authorities of their town, to carry out the sentence.<p>Moses did not directly institute a superior tribunal at the place of the sanctuary on this occasion, but rather assumed its existence; not however its existence at that time (as Riehm and other modern critics suppose), but its establishment and existence in the future. Just as he gives no minute directions concerning the organization of the different local courts, but leaves this to the natural development of the judicial institutions already in existence, so he also restricts himself, so far as the higher court is concerned, to general allusions, which might serve as a guide to the national rulers of a future day, to organize it according to the existing models. He had no disorganized mob before him, but a well-ordered nation, already in possession of civil institutions, with fruitful germs for further expansion and organization. In addition to its civil classification into tribes, families, fathers' houses, and family groups, which possessed at once their rulers in their own heads, the nation had received in the priesthood, with the high priest at the head, and the Levites as their assistants, a spiritual class, which mediated between the congregation and the Lord, and not only kept up the knowledge of right in the people as the guardian of the law, but by virtue of the high priest's office was able to lay the rights of the people before God, and in difficult cases could ask for His decision. Moreover, a leader had already been appointed for the nation, for the time immediately succeeding Moses' death; and in this nomination of Joshua, a pledge had been given that the Lord would never leave it without a supreme ruler of its civil affairs, but, along with the high priest, would also appoint a judge at the place of the central sanctuary, who would administer justice in the highest court in association with the priests. On the ground of these facts, sit was enough for the future to mention the Levitical priests and the judge who would be at the place of the sanctuary, as constituting the court by which the difficult questions were to be decided.<p>(Note: The simple fact, that the judicial court at the place of the national sanctuary is described in such general terms, furnishes a convincing proof that we have here the words of Moses, and not those of some later prophetic writer who had copied the superior court at Jerusalem of the times of the kings, as Riehm and the critics assume.)<p>For instance, the words themselves show distinctly enough, that by "the judge" we are not to understand the high priest, but the temporal judge or president of the superior court; and it is evident from the singular, "the priest that standeth to minister there before the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-12.htm">Deuteronomy 17:12</a>), that the high priest is included among the priests. The expression "the priests the Levites" (Levitical priests), which also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-18.htm">Deuteronomy 17:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-1.htm">Deuteronomy 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-8.htm">Deuteronomy 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-9.htm">Deuteronomy 27:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-9.htm">Deuteronomy 31:9</a>, instead of "sons of Aaron," which we find in the middle books, is quite in harmony with the time and character of the book before us. As long as Aaron was living with his sons, the priesthood consisted only of himself and his sons, that is to say, of one family. Hence all the instructions in the middle books are addressed to them, and for the most part to Aaron personally (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28.htm">Exodus 28</a> and 29; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/8.htm">Leviticus 8-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>, etc.). This as all changed when Aaron died; henceforth the priesthood consisted simply of the descendants of Aaron and his sons, who were no longer one family, but formed a distinct class in the nation, the legitimacy of which arose from its connection with the tribe of Levi, to which Aaron himself had belonged. It was evidently more appropriate, therefore, to describe them as sons of Levi than as sons of Aaron, which had been the title formerly given to the priests, with the exception of the high priest, viz., Aaron himself. - In connection with the superior court, however, the priests are introduced rather as knowing and teaching the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>), than as actual judges. For this reason appeal was to be made not only to them, but also to the judge, whose duty it was in any case to make the judicial inquiry and pronounce the sentence. - The object of the verb "inquire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-9.htm">Deuteronomy 17:9</a>) follows after "they shall show thee," viz., "the word of right," the judicial sentence which is sought (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-6.htm">2 Chronicles 19:6</a>).</body></html>
