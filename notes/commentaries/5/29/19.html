The LXX. have a strange paraphrase, “So that the sinner shall not involve the righteous with him in destruction.” The thought seems to be that, perhaps, one idolater would not make so much difference to Israel. He would never involve the whole nation in destruction. The drunkard could not be the ruin of the thirsty, so to speak, and, therefore, he might do as he pleased, and might, in fact, escape punishment, being protected by the general prosperity of Israel. The quotation in the Epistle to the Hebrews meets this mistaken view admirably: “Lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and <span class= "ital">thereby many be defiled.” </span>The Targums render “to add sins of infirmity to sins of presumption,” a rendering which partly explains that of the LXX.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-19.htm" title="And it come to pass, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have peace, though I walk in the imagination of my heart, to add drunkenness to thirst:">Deuteronomy 29:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">The words of this curse — </span>This oath and execration, wherein he swore he would keep covenant with God, and that with a curse pronounced against himself if he did not perform it. <span class="ital">Bless himself — </span>Flatter himself in his own eyes with vain hopes, as if God did not mind such things, and either could not, or would not punish them. <span class="ital">Peace </span>— Safety and prosperity. <span class="ital">My </span>own <span class="ital">heart — </span>Though I do not follow God’s command, but my own devices. <span class="ital">To add drunkenness to thirst — </span>The words may be rendered, <span class="ital">to add thirst to drunkenness, </span>and so the sense may be, that when he hath multiplied his sins, and made himself as it were drunk with them, yet he is not satisfied therewith, but still whets his appetite, and provokes his thirst after more, as drunkards often use means to make themselves thirst after more drink. This is well deserving of our most serious consideration. Moses here assures the Israelites that, how much soever they might flatter themselves with hopes of peace and safety on account of their privileges, none of these would avail them at all if they forsook the law of God, and apostatized from his worship and service. This people, however, notwithstanding this solemn warning, did, in after ages, confide in those outward privileges, and that at a time when they lived in the open violation of the divine commands. <span class="ital">The temple, the temple of the Lord! </span>was their cry and their confidence, as if the having that among them had been sufficient to save and render them prosperous and happy, even although they defiled it with their abominations. But they found, by sad experience, that the threatenings denounced by Moses against the violators of God’s law were fulfilled. Let us all take warning by this, and neither as a nation nor as individuals dare to promise ourselves security and peace while we <span class="ital">walk in the imagination of our own hearts, </span>and live in sin and forgetfulness of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:10-21 The national covenant made with Israel, not only typified the covenant of grace made with true believers, but also represented the outward dispensation of the gospel. Those who have been enabled to consent to the Lord's new covenant of mercy and grace in Jesus Christ, and to give up themselves to be his people, should embrace every opportunity of renewing their open profession of relation to him, and their obligation to him, as the God of salvation, walking according thereto. The sinner is described as one whose heart turns away from his God; there the mischief begins, in the evil heart of unbelief, which inclines men to depart from the living God to dead idols. Even to this sin men are now tempted, when drawn aside by their own lusts and fancies. Such men are roots that bear gall and wormwood. They are weeds which, if let alone, overspread the whole field. Satan may for a time disguise this bitter morsel, so that thou shalt not have the natural taste of it, but at the last day, if not before, the true taste shall be discerned. Notice the sinner's security in sin. Though he hears the words of the curse, yet even then he thinks himself safe from the wrath of God. There is scarcely a threatening in all the book of God more dreadful than this. Oh that presumptuous sinners would read it, and tremble! for it is a real declaration of the wrath of God, against ungodliness and unrighteousness of man.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare on the thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm">Jeremiah 23:17</a>. The secret and presumptuous sinner is meant who flatters himself that all is well and will be well with him, since he follows his own devices and prospers. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-11.htm">Psalm 73:11</a> ff.<p>To add drunkenness to thirst - The sense is probably: "Himself, drinking iniquity like water, <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-16.htm">Job 15:16</a>, he corrupts and destroys others who are thirsting for it or prone to it."<p>The sense of the whole passage from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-16.htm">Deuteronomy 29:16</a> onward to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a> may be exhibited thus: "Ye have seen the abominations of idolatry among the pagan. Do you therefore look diligently that there be no secret idolater among you; a root of bitterness to all about him. Let there be no one, I say, who when he hears the curses of the Law against this sin, flatters himself, saying within himself, 'All will be well, for I walk unmolested in my own self-chosen path; ' and thus acting, not only takes his own fill of sin, but destroys likewise every tempted brother within his reach, for the Lord will not spare him," etc. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-29. Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God&#8212;The whole congregation of Israel, of all ages and conditions, all&#8212;young as well as old; menials as well as masters; native Israelites as well as naturalized strangers&#8212;all were assembled before the tabernacle to renew the Sinaitic covenant. None of them were allowed to consider themselves as exempt from the terms of that national compact, lest any lapsing into idolatry might prove a root of bitterness, spreading its noxious seed and corrupt influence all around (compare Heb 12:15). It was of the greatest consequence thus to reach the heart and conscience of everyone, for some might delude themselves with the vain idea that by taking the oath (De 29:12) by which they engaged themselves in covenant with God, they would surely secure its blessings. Then, even though they would not rigidly adhere to His worship and commands, but would follow the devices and inclinations of their own hearts, yet they would think that He would wink at such liberties and not punish them. It was of the greatest consequence to impress all with the strong and abiding conviction, that while the covenant of grace had special blessings belonging to it, it at the same time had curses in reserve for transgressors, the infliction of which would be as certain, as lasting and severe. This was the advantage contemplated in the law being rehearsed a second time. The picture of a once rich and flourishing region, blasted and doomed in consequence of the sins of its inhabitants, is very striking, and calculated to awaken awe in every reflecting mind. Such is, and long has been, the desolate state of Palestine; and, in looking at its ruined cities, its blasted coast, its naked mountains, its sterile and parched soil&#8212;all the sad and unmistakable evidences of a land lying under a curse&#8212;numbers of travellers from Europe, America, and the Indies ("strangers from a far country," De 29:22) in the present day see that the Lord has executed His threatening. Who can resist the conclusion that it has been inflicted "because the inhabitants had forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers. &#8230; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book"?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When he, </span> i.e. that root or that man mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm" title="Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from the LORD our God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;">Deu 29:18</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of this curse, </span> i.e. of that oath mentioned <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-12.htm" title="That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:">Deu 29:12</a></span>, wherein he swore that he would keep covenant with God, and that with a curse pronounced against himself if he did not perform it.
