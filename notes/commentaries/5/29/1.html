But they cannot be right in so doing. For though the pronoun “these” in Hebrew has nothing to determine whether it belongs to what precedes or to what follows, yet the context shows that the covenant is described in Deuteronomy 29, not in Deuteronomy 28 (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/29-12.htm" title="That you should enter into covenant with the LORD your God, and into his oath, which the LORD your God makes with you this day:">Deuteronomy 29:12-15</a> below). It is very significant that this “covenant in the land of Moab” <span class= "ital">stands outside </span>the tremendous sanction appended to the expansion of the Sinaitic covenant in Deuteronomy. The effect of this arrangement may be illustrated by a reference to Leviticus 26, 27. The “sanction” of the law in Leviticus, which is a complete code of ceremonial and moral holiness, is contained in Deuteronomy 26. But that chapter is followed by a passage respecting vows, which are not compulsory, and therefore obviously lie, as a whole, outside that which is “commanded.” The position of Deuteronomy 29, 30 is analogous to that of Leviticus 27. Thus we see that the tremendous curse of the Sinaitic covenant <span class= "ital">is not the end of God’s dealings with the chosen people. </span>After that, there is still another covenant, to the force of which there is no limit (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-15.htm" title="But with him that stands here with us this day before the LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this day:">Deuteronomy 29:15</a> below). The gifts and calling of God are irrevocable. Nothing can destroy the relation between Jehovah and Israel. Their resurrection as a nation may well be described by the words of Moses in Psalms 90, “Thou turnest man to destruction (national death—Deuteronomy 28), and sayest (Deuteronomy 29, 30), <span class= "ital">Return, </span>ye children of men (resurrection). <span class= "ital">For </span>a thousand years in thy sight (though spent in the grave) are but as yesterday when it is past, and as <span class= "ital">a watch in the night</span>” (to be followed by the dawn of morning). “A watch in the night” is not the blackness of darkness for ever.<p><span class= "bld">Beside the covenant which He made with them in Horeb.</span>—It should be carefully noted that the formal repetition of the law in Moses’ second great discourse in this book opens with these words (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-2.htm" title="The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 5:2</a>), “the <span class= "ital">Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.” </span>There is no real break in Deuteronomy from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-1.htm" title="And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and keep, and do them.">Deuteronomy 5:1</a> to the end of Deuteronomy 26 and Deuteronomy 27, 28 are the “sanction” of that covenant.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/29.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-1.htm" title="These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 29:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">These are the words of the covenant — </span>Having thus repeated and enlarged upon the laws formerly delivered at Horeb, shown this new generation the covenant they were under, and the time and manner of their renewing it after they had entered Canaan; and having thus pathetically expatiated on the blessings and curses annexed to it, Moses summoned again the whole assembly, to press them to a careful obedience by considerations of the most powerful nature. <span class="ital">Besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb — </span>Not a different covenant from that <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-3.htm" title="And Moses came and told the people all the words of the LORD, and all the judgments: and all the people answered with one voice, and said, All the words which the LORD has said will we do....">Exodus 24:3-8</a>, but a renewal of the same, with some additions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>29:1-9 Both former mercies, and fresh mercies, should be thought on by us as motives to obedience.

God gives not only food and raiment, but wealth and large possessions, to many to whom he does not give grace. Many enjoy the gifts, who have not hearts to perceive the Giver, nor the true design and use of the gifts.

Not what go before, but follow after, in the next chapters, to the end of the book; in which are various promises of grace, and promises of good things, both with respect to Jews and Gentiles, intermixed with other things: <p>which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab; or to declare unto them, and acquaint them with, they being now in the plains of Moab, ready to enter into the land of, Canaan: <p>besides the covenant which he made with them at Horeb: or Sinai; which Jarchi interprets, besides the curses in Leviticus, delivered on Sinai; he seems to have respect to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-14.htm">Leviticus 26:14</a>. This covenant was different from that at Sinai, spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>; being made not only at a different time, at near forty years' distance, and at a different place, nor Sinai; but when Israel were come nearer Mount Sion, and were actually possessed of part of their inheritance, the land of promise, that part of the land of Moab which the two kings of the Amorites had seized and dwelt in, whom Israel had dispossessed; and with different persons, that generation being dead, excepting a very few, which were at Sinai: but it was different as to the substance and matter of it, it not only including that, and being a renewal of it, as is generally thought, but containing such declarations of grace which had not been made before, not only respecting the repenting and returning Israelites, but the Gentiles also; for this covenant was made with the stranger, as well as with Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-11.htm">Deuteronomy 29:11</a>; and relates to the times of the Messiah, the call of the Gentiles, the conversion of the Jews, and their return to their own land in the latter day. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">These <i>are</i> the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> Horeb.</span><p>(a) That is, the articles, or conditions.<p>(b) At the first giving of the law, which was forty years earlier.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-1.htm" title="These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.">Deuteronomy 29:1</a> is thus an editorial addition, probably inserted to close what precedes, when 29 f. was added to D.

With this bold anthropomorphic expression Moses seeks to remove from the nation the last prop of false confidence in the mercy of God. Greatly as the sin of man troubles God, and little as the pleasure may be which He has in the death of the wicked, yet the holiness of His love demands the punishment and destruction of those who despise the riches of His goodness and long-suffering; so that He displays His glory in the judgment and destruction of the wicked no less than in blessing and prospering the righteous.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63-64</a><p>Those who had not succumbed to the plagues and strokes of God, would be torn from the land of their inheritance, and scattered among all nations to the end of the earth, and there be compelled to serve other gods, which are wood and stone, which have no life and no sensation, and therefore can hear no prayer, and cannot deliver out of any distress (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-27.htm">Deuteronomy 4:27</a>.).</body></html>
