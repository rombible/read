It is no new thing for God to bring desolating judgments on a people near to him in profession. He never does this without good reason. It concerns us to seek for the reason, that we may give glory to God, and take warning to ourselves. Thus the law of Moses leaves sinners under the curse, and rooted out of the Lord's land; but the grace of Christ toward penitent, believing sinners, plants them again in their land; and they shall no more be pulled up, being kept by the power of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/29.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The description is borrowed from the local features of the Dead Sea and its vicinity. The towns of the vale of Siddim were fertile and well watered (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>) until devastated by the wrath of God <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24-25</a>. The ruin of Israel and its land should be of the like sort (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-34.htm">Psalm 107:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a>). The desolate state of Palestine at present, and the traces of former fertility and prosperity, are attested by every traveler. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/29.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10-29. Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord your God&#8212;The whole congregation of Israel, of all ages and conditions, all&#8212;young as well as old; menials as well as masters; native Israelites as well as naturalized strangers&#8212;all were assembled before the tabernacle to renew the Sinaitic covenant. None of them were allowed to consider themselves as exempt from the terms of that national compact, lest any lapsing into idolatry might prove a root of bitterness, spreading its noxious seed and corrupt influence all around (compare Heb 12:15). It was of the greatest consequence thus to reach the heart and conscience of everyone, for some might delude themselves with the vain idea that by taking the oath (De 29:12) by which they engaged themselves in covenant with God, they would surely secure its blessings. Then, even though they would not rigidly adhere to His worship and commands, but would follow the devices and inclinations of their own hearts, yet they would think that He would wink at such liberties and not punish them. It was of the greatest consequence to impress all with the strong and abiding conviction, that while the covenant of grace had special blessings belonging to it, it at the same time had curses in reserve for transgressors, the infliction of which would be as certain, as lasting and severe. This was the advantage contemplated in the law being rehearsed a second time. The picture of a once rich and flourishing region, blasted and doomed in consequence of the sins of its inhabitants, is very striking, and calculated to awaken awe in every reflecting mind. Such is, and long has been, the desolate state of Palestine; and, in looking at its ruined cities, its blasted coast, its naked mountains, its sterile and parched soil&#8212;all the sad and unmistakable evidences of a land lying under a curse&#8212;numbers of travellers from Europe, America, and the Indies ("strangers from a far country," De 29:22) in the present day see that the Lord has executed His threatening. Who can resist the conclusion that it has been inflicted "because the inhabitants had forsaken the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers. &#8230; and the anger of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book"?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/29.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/29.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord rooted them out of the land,.... Which was true both at the Babylonish captivity by Nebuchadnezzar, and at their present one by the Romans; and especially the latter, by whom they have been so rooted out, as that they have not been able to return to it these 1700 years, nor to have any inheritance or possession in it; whereas, at the end of seventy years, they returned from the Babylonish captivity to their land again: and which was done <p>in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation; which were most abundantly shown in the utter destruction of their land, city, and temple, by the Romans: <p>and cast them another land, as it is this day; the ten tribes were cast into Assyria, and from thence into the cities of the Medes, the two tribes into the land of Chaldea, and now into all lands; and none their own, but another, a strange and foreign country. The word "cast" denotes the vehemence of the divine displeasure at them, expressed by the removal of them out of their own land into another. In the Hebrew word for "cast", a middle letter in it is greater than usual; the reason of which perhaps is, that this dealing of God with them might be observed and taken notice of as very remarkable; and Ainsworth thinks it is to observe the greatness of the punishment; and the Jews understand this of the casting away of the ten tribes: and they gather from hence that the ten tribes shall not return, though about it they are divided; for so they say in the Misnah (h),"the ten tribes shall not return, as it is said, and cast them into another land, as this day; as the day goes and does not return, so they go and return not; these are the words of R. Akiba. R. Eliezer says, as the day brings on darkness and light, so the ten tribes who are now dark shall be enlightened.'' <p>(h) Sanhedrin, c. 11. sect. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/29.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/29.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">rooted them out</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">natash</span>, not elsewhere in the Hex. but common in Jer. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-10.htm" title="The LORD your God has multiplied you, and, behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.">Deuteronomy 1:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding you may kill and eat flesh in all your gates, whatever your soul lusts after, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which he has given you: the unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the hart.">Deuteronomy 12:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in anger, and in</span> <span class="bld">fury</span>, <span class="ital">and in great</span> <span class="bld">wrath</span>] (Driver).

Future generations of Israel, and the stranger from a distant land, when they saw the strokes of the Lord which burst upon the land, and the utter desolation of the land, would ask whence this devastation, and receive the reply, The Lord had smitten the land thus in His anger, because its inhabitants (the Israelites) had forsaken His covenant. With regard to the construction, observe that &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, is resumed in &#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24</a>, the subject of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a> being expanded into the general notion, "all nations" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-24.htm">Deuteronomy 29:24</a>). With &#1493;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-22.htm">Deuteronomy 29:22</a>, a parenthetical clause is inserted, giving the reason for the main thought, in the form of a circumstantial clause; and to this there is attached, by a loose apposition in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, a still further picture of the divine strokes according to their effect upon the land. The nouns in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>, "brimstone and salt burning," are in apposition to the strokes (plagues), and so far depend upon "they see." The description is borrowed from the character of the Dead Sea and its vicinity, to which there is an express allusion in the words, "like the overthrow of Sodom," etc., i.e., of the towns of the vale of Siddim (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-2.htm">Genesis 14:2</a>), which resembled paradise, the garden of Jehovah, before their destruction (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/19-24.htm">Genesis 19:24</a>.). </body></html>
