He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts.

Rise ye up &#8230; and pass over the river Arnon&#8212;At its mouth, this stream is eighty-two feet wide and four deep. It flows in a channel banked by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone. At the date of the Israelitish migration to the east of the Jordan, the whole of the fine country lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok including the mountainous tract of Gilead, had been seized by the Amorites, who, being one of the nations doomed to destruction (see De 7:2; 20:16), were utterly exterminated. Their country fell by right of conquest into the hands of the Israelites. Moses, however, considering this doom as referring solely to the Amorite possessions west of Jordan, sent a pacific message to Sihon, requesting permission to go through his territories, which lay on the east of that river. It is always customary to send messengers before to prepare the way; but the rejection of Moses' request by Sihon and his opposition to the advance of the Israelites (Nu 21:23; Jud 11:26) drew down on himself and his Amorite subjects the predicted doom on the first pitched battlefield with the Canaanites. It secured to Israel not only the possession of a fine and pastoral country, but, what was of more importance to them, a free access to the Jordan on the east.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By God’s command, these being a part of those people who were devoted by the Lord of life and death to utter destruction for their abominable wickedness.

Mesha (Moabite Stone, 14–17) records that having taken Nebo from Israel he slew the whole population for he ‘had <span class="ital">devoted it</span> to Ashtar-Chemosh’; the same verb as in Heb. To Israel as to other peoples a war was from first to last a religious process (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-1.htm" title="When you go out to battle against your enemies, and see horses, and chariots, and a people more than you, be not afraid of them: for the LORD your God is with you, which brought you up out of the land of Egypt.">Deuteronomy 20:1</a> ff.) and the <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> was the climax of a series of solemn rites. It consisted of the devotion to the deity, by destruction, of the captives and spoil. The name is from the root <span class="ital">ḥrm</span>, ‘to set apart’ or ‘shut off’ (cp. Ar. <span class="ital">ḥaram</span> ‘sacred precincts’ and <span class="ital">ḥarîm</span>) and was not confined to war. By the earliest code every idolatrous Israelite was put to the ḥerem, E, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a> [19]; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-6.htm" title="If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son, or your daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your friend, which is as your own soul, entice you secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which you have not known, you, nor your fathers;...">Deuteronomy 13:6-11</a> of idolaters, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/13-12.htm" title="If you shall hear say in one of your cities, which the LORD your God has given you to dwell there, saying,...">Deuteronomy 13:12-18</a> [13–19] of an idolatrous city; P, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm" title="Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.">Leviticus 27:28</a> f. In war the full process was the slaughter of the conquered population and their cattle, the burning of combustible spoil, and the oblation of the rest to the sanctuary. So in the story of the fall of Jericho and Achan’s trespass, Joshua 6 f. (especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-17.htm" title="You shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you....">Deuteronomy 6:17-19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-21.htm" title="Then you shall say to your son, We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand:">Deuteronomy 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-24.htm" title="And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as it is at this day.">Deuteronomy 6:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-1.htm" title="When the LORD your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and has cast out many nations before you, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier than you;">Deuteronomy 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-11.htm" title="You shall therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments, which I command you this day, to do them.">Deuteronomy 7:11</a> ff.), which however contains many editorial additions. But as we see from several narratives and laws, the actual practice varied from time to time under the competing influences of religious feeling, material considerations and humane impulses. The most illustrative passage is 1 Samuel 15. Samuel charges Saul to <span class="ital">devote</span> all ‘Amaleḳ and their cattle; Saul spares the king and <span class="ital">the best of the cattle</span>. Either his excuse, that he reserved them for sacrifice, is an afterthought; or from the first he had been unwilling that the best cattle should be rendered by the <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> unusable by the people in sacrificial feasts. Was the king moved by feelings of humanity? Samuel condemns his action as disobedience against Jehovah; so absolutely at that time was the <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> conceived by the religious leaders. The deuteronomic directions, all in the Sg. address, distinguish between Israel’s treatment of the seven Canaanite nations and of Israelite idolaters on the one side, and their treatment of other nations at a distance:—(<span class="ital">a</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm" title="And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:">Deuteronomy 7:2</a> : the seven nations are to be put to the <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> because of their idolatry and no league with them is allowed; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-25.htm" title="This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you.">Deuteronomy 2:25</a> f. their idols are to be burned with the silver and gold on them, for they are <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> and if used by Israel would make the people <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> or <span class="ital">devoted to destruction</span>. Similarly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/13-15.htm" title="You shall surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.">Deuteronomy 13:15</a> f. every Israelite community falling to idolatry shall be devoted, and their city, cattle, and spoil burned to <span class="ital">Jehovah thy God</span>. But (<span class="ital">b</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm" title="When you come near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it.">Deuteronomy 20:10</a> ff directs that distant enemies if they submit shall be spared, though they must become tributary; while if they resist only the males shall be slain, the women, children, cattle and spoil being treated as booty. And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/20-16.htm" title="But of the cities of these people, which the LORD your God does give you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that breathes:...">Deuteronomy 20:16-17</a> it is repeated that the nations of Palestine <span class="ital">shall be devoted</span>. Religious feeling, the desire that Israel shall not be infected by the idolatry from which they ran most risk of infection, is obviously the paramount motive of these laws. But it is remarkable that the only instances of the <span class="ital">ḥerem</span> recorded in Deut., those against Sîḥôn and ‘Ôg, fully agree neither with the treatment enjoined by the deuteronomic laws against the seven nations, nor with that enjoined against distant enemies, but combine features of both. The captive men, women, and children were slain, but the cattle and spoil reserved for booty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-34.htm" title="And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain:">Deuteronomy 2:34</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-6.htm" title="And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.">Deuteronomy 3:6</a> f. So too in Jos. (outside the story of Achan):—<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-2.htm" title="And you shall do to Ai and her king as you did to Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle thereof, shall you take for a prey to yourselves: lay you an ambush for the city behind it.">Joshua 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-27.htm" title="Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a prey to themselves, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.">Joshua 8:27</a> spoil and cattle reserved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-28.htm" title="And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them, and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and he did to the king of Makkedah as he did to the king of Jericho.">Joshua 10:28</a> ff., only the people <span class="ital">devoted</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a> horses houghed, chariots burned; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/11-11.htm" title="And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire....">Joshua 11:11-15</a>, people devoted, cattle and spoil reserved. Except <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-9.htm" title="And Joshua did to them as the LORD bade him: he hamstrung their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.">Joshua 11:9</a> these passages appear to be editorial.—In connection with this subject note that Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-9.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:">Amos 1:9</a>) condemns as inhuman the selling into captivity of a whole population, just as to-day it is contrary to the Arab conscience to extinguish a ḳabîla or tribe in war (Doughty, <span class="ital">Ar. Des.</span> i. 335). Yet, just as by Samuel in the case of Saul, and in Deut., this natural conscience has often been overborne by the rigorous religious demands of Islam. The parallel is instructive; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/20-10.htm" title="When you come near to a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace to it....">Deuteronomy 20:10-18</a>.—See on the use of the term in a criminal case, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm" title="He that sacrifices to any god, save to the LORD only, he shall be utterly destroyed.">Exodus 22:20</a>, with Driver’s note.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>If Moses, notwithstanding this, sent messengers to king Sihon with words of peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-26.htm">Deuteronomy 2:26</a>.; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-21.htm">Numbers 21:21</a>.), this was done to show the king of the Amorites, that it was through his own fault that his kingdom and lands and life were lost. The wish to pass through his land in a peaceable manner was quite seriously expressed; although Moses foresaw, in consequence of the divine communication, that he would reject his proposal, and meet Israel with hostilities. For Sihon's kingdom did not form part of the land of Canaan, which God had promised to the patriarchs for their descendants; and the divine foreknowledge of the hardness of Sihon no more destroyed the freedom of his will to resolve, or the freedom of his actions, than the circumstance that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a> the unwillingness of Sihon is described as the effect of his being hardened by God Himself. The hardening was quite as much the production of human freedom and guilt, as the consequence of the divine decree; just as in the case of Pharaoh. On Kedemoth, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1498;, equivalent to "upon the way, and always upon the way," i.e., upon the high road alone, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-19.htm">Numbers 20:19</a>. On the behaviour of the Edomites towards Israel, mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-10.htm">Numbers 21:10</a>. In the same way the Moabites also supplied Israel with provisions for money. This statement is not at variance with the unbrotherly conduct for which the Moabites are blamed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-4.htm">Deuteronomy 23:4</a>, viz., that they did not meet the Israelites with bread and water. For &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;, to meet and anticipate, signifies a hospitable reception, and the offering of food and drink without reward, which is essentially different from selling for money. "In Ar" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-29.htm">Deuteronomy 2:29</a>), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-18.htm">Deuteronomy 2:18</a>. The suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-30.htm">Deuteronomy 2:30</a>) refers to the king, who is mentioned as the lord of the land, in the place of the land itself, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-18.htm">Numbers 20:18</a>.</body></html>
