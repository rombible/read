God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-1.htm">Deuteronomy 2:1</a> seems to refer in general terms to the long years of wandering, the details of which were not for Moses' present purpose. The command of <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-2.htm">Deuteronomy 2:2-3</a> relates to their journey from Kadesh to Mount Hor <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-37.htm">Numbers 33:37</a>, and directs their march around to the southern extremity of Mount Seir, so as to "compass the land of Edom" <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-18.htm">Judges 11:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-4.htm">Numbers 21:4</a>, and so northward toward the Arnon, i. e., "by the way of the wilderness of Moab," <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-8.htm">Deuteronomy 2:8</a>. This circuitous path was followed because of the refusal of the Edomites to allow the people to pass through their territory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>De 2:1-37. The Story Is Continued.<p>1. Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea&#8212;After their unsuccessful attack upon the Canaanites, the Israelites broke up their encampment at Kadesh, and journeying southward over the west desert of Tih as well as through the great valley of the Ghor and Arabah, they extended their removals as far as the gulf of Akaba.<p>we compassed mount Seir many days&#8212;In these few words Moses comprised the whole of that wandering nomadic life through which they passed during thirty-eight years, shifting from place to place, and regulating their stations by the prospect of pasturage and water. Within the interval they went northward a second time to Kadesh, but being refused a passage through Edom and opposed by the Canaanites and Amalekites, they again had no alternative but to traverse once more the great Arabah southwards to the Red Sea, where turning to the left and crossing the long, lofty mountain chain to the eastward of Ezion-geber (Nu 21:4, 5), they issued into the great and elevated plains, which are still traversed by the Syrian pilgrims in their way to Mecca. They appear to have followed northward nearly the same route, which is now taken by the Syrian hadji, along the western skirts of this great desert, near the mountains of Edom [Robinson]. It was on entering these plains they received the command, "Ye have compassed this mountain (this hilly tract, now Jebel Shera) long enough, turn ye northward" [De 2:3].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Lord spake unto me,....

"Strengthen him:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; and with regard to the installation of Joshua as the leader of Israel, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-19</a>. The suffix in &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points back to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>. Joshua would divide the land among the Israelites for an inheritance, viz., (v. 39) among the young Israelites, the children of the condemned generation, whom Moses, when making a further communication of the judicial sentence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), had described as having no share in the sins of their parents, by adding, "who know not to-day what is good and evil." This expression is used to denote a condition of spiritual infancy and moral responsibility (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15-16</a>). It is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40-45</a> he proceeds to describe still further, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, how the people, by resisting the command of God to go back into the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>), had simply brought still greater calamities upon themselves, and had had to atone for the presumptuous attempt to force a way into Canaan, in opposition to the express will of the Lord, by enduring a miserable defeat. Instead of "they acted presumptuously to go up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), Moses says here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, "ye acted frivolously to go up;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>, "ye acted rashly, and went up." &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to boil, or boil over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>), signifies to act thoughtlessly, haughtily, or rashly. On the particular fact mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-44.htm">Deuteronomy 1:44</a>, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-45.htm">Numbers 14:45</a>.</body></html>
