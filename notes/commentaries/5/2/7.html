God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I have given mount Seir to Esau - Though the descendants of Esau were conquered by David <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a>, yet they were not dispossessed of their land, and in the reign of Jehoshaphat they regained their independence <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20-22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. Meddle not with them&#8212;that is, "which dwell in Seir" (De 2:4)&#8212;for there was another branch of Esau's posterity, namely, the Amalekites, who were to be fought against and destroyed (Ge 36:12; Ex 17:14; De 25:17). But the people of Edom were not to be injured, either in their persons or property. And although the approach of so vast a nomadic horde as the Israelites naturally created apprehension, they were to take no advantage of the prevailing terror to compel the Edomites to accept whatever terms they imposed. They were merely to pass "through" or along their border, and to buy meat and water of them for money (De 2:6). The people, kinder than their king, did sell them bread, meat, fruits, and water in their passage along their border (De 2:29), in the same manner as the Syrian caravan of Mecca is now supplied by the people of the same mountains, who meet the pilgrims as at a fair or market on the hadji route [Robinson]. Although the Israelites still enjoyed a daily supply of the manna, there was no prohibition against their eating other food when opportunity afforded. Only they were not to cherish an inordinate desire for it. Water is a scarce commodity and is often paid for by travellers in those parts. It was the more incumbent on the Israelites to do so, as, by the blessing of God, they possessed plenty of means to purchase, and the long-continued experience of the extraordinary goodness of God to them, should inspire such confidence in Him as would suppress the smallest thought of resorting to fraud or violence in supplying their wants.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By God’s blessing thou art able to buy thy conveniences, and therefore thy theft and rapine will be inexcusable, because without any pretence of necessity. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He knoweth, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">he hath known</span>, i.e. observed, or regarded with care and kindness, which that word oft notes, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-6.htm" title="For the LORD knows the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.">Psalm 1:6</a> 31:7</span>; which experience of God’s singular goodness to thee, should make thee trust him still, and not use any indirect and unjust practices to procure. what thou wantest or desirest. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thine hands,....

After a long stay in Kadesh, they commenced their return into the desert. The words, "We departed...by the way to the Red Sea," point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>. This departure is expressly designated as an act of obedience to the divine command recorded there, by the expression "as Jehovah spake to me." Consequently Moses is not speaking here of the second departure of the congregation from Kadesh to go to Mount Hor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-22.htm">Numbers 20:22</a>), but of the first departure after the condemnation of the generation that came out of Egypt. "And we went round Mount Seir many days." This going round Mount Seir includes the thirty-eight years' wanderings, though we are not therefore to picture it as "going backwards and forwards, and then entering the Arabah again" (Schultz). Just as Moses passed over the reassembling of the congregation at Kadesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/20-1.htm">Numbers 20:1</a>), so he also overlooked the going to and fro in the desert, and fixed his eye more closely upon the last journey from Kadesh to Mount Hor, that he might recall to the memory of the congregation how the Lord had led them to the end of all their wandering.</body></html>
