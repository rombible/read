God not only chastised them for their murmuring and unbelief, but prepared them for Canaan; by humbling them for sin, teaching them to mortify their lusts, to follow God, and to comfort themselves in him. Though Israel may be long kept waiting for deliverance and enlargement, it will come at last. Before God brought Israel to destroy their enemies in Canaan, he taught them to forgive their enemies in Edom. They must not, under pretence of God's covenant and conduct, think to seize all they could lay hands on. Dominion is not founded in grace. God's Israel shall be well placed, but must not expect to be placed alone in the midst of the earth. Religion must never be made a cloak for injustice. Scorn to be beholden to Edomites, when thou hast an all-sufficient God to depend upon. Use what thou hast, use it cheerfully. Thou hast experienced the care of the Divine providence, never use any crooked methods for thy supply. All this is equally to be applied to the experience of the believer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal reference.

As the Israelites, however, kept on the outskirts of their country, and did not attempt to penetrate into the interior, the Edomites did not attack them or seek to hinder their progress. The Israelites, on the other hand, were strictly forbidden to invade that country in a hostile manner; they were to watch over themselves, so as not to be tempted to make war on the Edomites, who were their brethren; as God would not give them any part, not so much as a foot-breadth, of that laud, for he had given Esau (i.e. the race descended from Esau, the Edomites - LXX, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x397;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;</span>) Mount Seir for a possession. <span class="cmt_word">They shall be afraid of you</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-15.htm">Exodus 15:15</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Who standeth before thee," equivalent to "in thy service" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-13.htm">Exodus 24:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-11.htm">Exodus 33:11</a> : for this meaning, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-7.htm">Deuteronomy 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a>). "Strengthen him:" comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-7.htm">Deuteronomy 31:7</a>; and with regard to the installation of Joshua as the leader of Israel, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-18.htm">Numbers 27:18-19</a>. The suffix in &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; points back to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>. Joshua would divide the land among the Israelites for an inheritance, viz., (v. 39) among the young Israelites, the children of the condemned generation, whom Moses, when making a further communication of the judicial sentence of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-31.htm">Numbers 14:31</a>), had described as having no share in the sins of their parents, by adding, "who know not to-day what is good and evil." This expression is used to denote a condition of spiritual infancy and moral responsibility (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-15.htm">Isaiah 7:15-16</a>). It is different in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-36.htm">2 Samuel 19:36</a>. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-40.htm">Deuteronomy 1:40-45</a> he proceeds to describe still further, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-39.htm">Numbers 14:39-45</a>, how the people, by resisting the command of God to go back into the desert (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-25.htm">Numbers 14:25</a>), had simply brought still greater calamities upon themselves, and had had to atone for the presumptuous attempt to force a way into Canaan, in opposition to the express will of the Lord, by enduring a miserable defeat. Instead of "they acted presumptuously to go up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-44.htm">Numbers 14:44</a>), Moses says here, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>, "ye acted frivolously to go up;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-43.htm">Deuteronomy 1:43</a>, "ye acted rashly, and went up." &#1492;&#1494;&#1497;&#1491; from &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;, to boil, or boil over (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>), signifies to act thoughtlessly, haughtily, or rashly.
