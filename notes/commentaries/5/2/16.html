Thus it became more fully manifest that <span class="ital">the excellency of the power </span>which subdued the warlike Canaanites, <span class="ital">was of God and not of man. </span>On the same principle, and with the same design, long after this, were the following words spoken by the Lord to Gideon: <span class="ital">The people that are with thee are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand hath saved me. </span>And thus, to subdue the enemies of God’s church, and bring sinners to the obedience of the faith, he <span class="ital">hath chosen the weak things of the world, and things that are despised, and things that are not, to bring to naught the things that are, that no flesh may glory in his presence.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-23 We have the origin of the Moabites, Edomites, and Ammonites. Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words, "said I," are not in the Hebrew.

To the east of Moab was the country of the Ammonites; these, also, the Israelites were to leave unassailed, for the Lord had given to them their land for a possession (cf. ver. 9). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In accordance with this divine command, they went past the Edomites by the side of their mountains, "from the way of the Arabah, from Elath (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a>) and Eziongeber" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm">Numbers 33:35</a>), sc., into the steppes of Moab, where they were encamped at that time.<p>God commanded them to behave in the same manner towards the Moabites, when they approached their frontier (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>). They were not to touch their land, because the Lord had given Ar to the descendants of Lot for a possession. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a> the Moabites are mentioned, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a> the Amorites also. The Moabites are designated as "sons of Lot," for the same reason for which the Edomites are called "brethren of Israel" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-4.htm">Deuteronomy 2:4</a>. The Israelites were to uphold the bond of blood-relationship with these tribes in the most sacred manner. Ar, the capital of Moabitis (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-15.htm">Numbers 21:15</a>), is used here for the land itself, which was named after the capital, and governed by it.</body></html>
