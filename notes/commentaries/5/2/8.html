It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged.

The site of it is marked by extensive mounds of rubbish.<p>Ezion-geber&#8212;now Akaba, both were within the territory of Edom; and after making a circuit of its southeastern boundary, the Israelites reached the border of Moab on the southeast of the Salt Sea. They had been forbidden by divine command to molest the Moabites in any way; and this special honor was conferred on that people not on their own account, for they were very wicked, but in virtue of their descent from Lot. (See on [113]De 23:3). Their territory comprised the fine country on the south, and partly on the north of the Arnon. They had won it by their arms from the original inhabitants, the Emims, a race, terrible, as their name imports, for physical power and stature (Ge 14:5), in like manner as the Edomites had obtained their settlement by the overthrow of the original occupiers of Seir, the Horims (Ge 14:6), who were troglodytes, or dwellers in caves. Moses alluded to these circumstances to encourage his countrymen to believe that God would much more enable them to expel the wicked and accursed Canaanites. At that time, however, the Moabites, having lost the greater part of their possessions through the usurpations of Sihon, were reduced to the small but fertile region between the Zered and the Arnon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ezion-gaber; </span> of which see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-35.htm" title="And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.">Numbers 33:35</a></span>, which may be either that place upon the Red Sea, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-26.htm" title="And king Solomon made a navy of ships in Eziongeber, which is beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red sea, in the land of Edom.">1 Kings 9:26</a></span>, or another of the same name. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">We turned, </span> to wit, from our direct road which lay through Edom’s land. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Self,....

The name, translated by LXX Ailôn, and probably meaning <span class="ital">palms</span>, has persisted. Strabo, XVI. iv. 4, Ailana; Josephus, Ailana, Ilanis and Elathous (‘now called Berenice’?); Ptolemy, Elana; the Christian Fathers, Aila and Ailia; Moslem Geographers, Wailah, Aila and ‘Aḳabat Aila (Idrisi, <span class="ital">ZDPV</span>, viii. 121); now el-‘Aḳabah, a village amid ancient ruins on the N.E. corner of the Gulf, with Turkish fort and garrison. To the N.W. is a large grove of palms with numerous ruins, called Îla (Robinson, <span class="ital">B.R.</span> i. 250 ff.; Doughty <span class="ital">Ar.

Eusebius states that in his day it was <span class="greekheb">Αἰσία</span> (Jerome Essia); Makrizi, 15th century, ‘a once important town ‘Aṣiûn.’ Robinson (<span class="ital">B.

This lies 18 miles N. of the Sea; while the O.T. data place ‘Eṣion-Geber beside Elath, whose site, as we have seen, is certainly on the present N.E. coast of the Gulf. Musil, however, reports that a tongue of the sea may once have reached Ma’ Ghaḍiân; there are remains of fortifications and gardens across what is now desert (II. 199). His guide told of a town there whose inhabitants had many ships; but a violent rain brought down such masses of stone from some of the wâdies that the sea was pushed back to el-‘Aḳaba (ii. 187). If the Ar. name be derived from the tree <span class="ital">ghaḍa’</span>, abundant in this region, it may have been attached to more places than one; or may have drifted as names easily do in Syria. The likeness between the LXX <span class="greekheb">Ἐμαεσειὼν</span> and Musil’s Ma’ Ghaḍiân is noteworthy.

These lower stretches are deep, the sides steep and the roads over them difficult for laden caravans. The route of the Hajj, apparently that of Israel, crosses the much shallower head of this Wâdy on the desert border. Once over it they were in the wilderness E. of Moab.

The Pl. is resumed in a charge to Israel to cross the Wâdy Zered, which they did (13); their time from Ḳadesh to the Zered being 38 years, and all the condemned generation being now dead under Jehovah’s hand (14 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the parallels in JE and P (some of which have been already given) see below on the separate verses.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from Ezion-gaber, we</span>, etc. Rather, <span class="accented">And we passed by from</span> (away from) <span class="accented">our brethren the sons of Esau</span>, <span class="accented">who dwelt in Self</span>, <span class="accented">from</span> (off from, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. alongside, but at some distance from) <span class="accented">the way of the</span> '<span class="accented">Arabah</span>, <span class="accented">from</span> (off from) <span class="accented">Elath and from Ezion-geber</span>.
