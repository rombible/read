Arnon.</span>—The territory from Arnon northward to Jabbok had been taken from Moab by the Amorites, and was to be possessed by Israel. (See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm" title="And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.">Numbers 21:24</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:24-37 God tried his people, by forbidding them to meddle with the rich countries of Moab and Ammon. He gives them possession of the country of the Amorites. If we keep from what God forbids, we shall not lose by our obedience. The earth is the Lord's and the fulness thereof; and he gives it to whom he pleases; but when there is no express direction, none can plead his grant for such proceedings. Though God assured the Israelites that the land should be their own, yet they must contend with the enemy. What God gives we must endeavour to get. What a new world did Israel now come into! Much more joyful will the change be, which holy souls will experience, when they remove out of the wilderness of this world to the better country, that is, the heavenly, to the city that has foundations. Let us, by reflecting upon God's dealings with his people Israel, be led to meditate upon our years spent in vanity, through our transgressions. But happy are those whom Jesus has delivered from the wrath to come. To whom he hath given the earnest of his Spirit in their hearts. Their inheritance cannot be affected by revolutions of kingdoms, or changes in earthly possessions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah - Read (Gaza, of which Azzah is the Hebrew form.

The Avims are no doubt identical with the Avites of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>, and were doubtless a scattered remnant of a people conquered by the Caphtorim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a> note) and living in their "enclosures" in the neighborhood of Gerar.

Rise ye up &#8230; and pass over the river Arnon&#8212;At its mouth, this stream is eighty-two feet wide and four deep. It flows in a channel banked by perpendicular cliffs of sandstone. At the date of the Israelitish migration to the east of the Jordan, the whole of the fine country lying between the Arnon and the Jabbok including the mountainous tract of Gilead, had been seized by the Amorites, who, being one of the nations doomed to destruction (see De 7:2; 20:16), were utterly exterminated. Their country fell by right of conquest into the hands of the Israelites. Moses, however, considering this doom as referring solely to the Amorite possessions west of Jordan, sent a pacific message to Sihon, requesting permission to go through his territories, which lay on the east of that river. It is always customary to send messengers before to prepare the way; but the rejection of Moses' request by Sihon and his opposition to the advance of the Israelites (Nu 21:23; Jud 11:26) drew down on himself and his Amorite subjects the predicted doom on the first pitched battlefield with the Canaanites. It secured to Israel not only the possession of a fine and pastoral country, but, what was of more importance to them, a free access to the Jordan on the east.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon,....

A little W. of the Hajj road a valley is formed some 250 ft below the plateau by the conjunction of several wâdies, which have risen among the desert hills to the E. of the road. Under the successive names of W. Sa‘ideh, Seil eṣ-Ṣefei, and W. el-Môjeb, it runs with a mainly W. direction, and a rapidly increasing depth (at ‘Aro‘er 1800 or 2000 feet below the plateau) between almost precipitous walls to the Dead Sea, about 3500 ft below the plateau. The valley is entered from N. and S. by other cañons, of which two are almost as long as itself. About 15 miles from its mouth it receives from the S. its chief tributary, a stream which with its valley has already for some stretch above the confluence borne the name el Môjeb, but higher up is known as W. es-Sulṭâni; probably (see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-13.htm" title="Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered.

Sihon and his people were Amorites, who had settled on the east of the Jordan in Gilead. But though not included in the original promise to Abraham, God had assigned this territory to the Israelites; and, therefore, he commanded the people under Moses to cross the Amen, and take the first step towards possessing the Promised Land, by assailing Sihon, King of Heshbon, assuring them that from that day he would "put the dread and fear of them upon all nations under the whole heaven," that is, all nations, wherever placed, to whom the fame of the Israelites should come (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-16.htm">Deuteronomy 11:16</a>), so that on hearing thereof, they should tremble and writhe as in pain (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5d7;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>). Moses, however, in the first instance, sent a message of peace to Sihon, proposing to pass through his territory on the same terms as he had made with the Moabites and Edomites, traveling by the highway, and paying for such provisions as his followers required. But this Sihon refused, and came out against Israel, with all his people, to battle. The issue was that he was utterly discomfited; all his towns were captured, he and all his people utterly destroyed, and the cattle and spoil of the whole country taken for booty. Israel thus became possessed of that entire territory, though it did not lie within the bounds of the land promised by God to Abraham, which was the reason, probably, why Moses made overtures of peace to Sihon, and would have passed through his country amicably, had he been permitted; but comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-10.htm">Deuteronomy 20:10</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When this generation had quite died out, the Lord made known to Moses, and through him to the people, that they were to cross over the boundary of Moab (i.e., the Arnon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-24.htm">Deuteronomy 2:24</a>; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm">Numbers 21:13</a>), the land of Ar (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>), "to come nigh over against the children of Ammon," i.e., to advance into the neighbourhood of the Ammonites, who lived to the east of Moab; but they were not to meddle with these descendants of Lot, because He would give them nothing of the land that was given them for a possession (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-19.htm">Deuteronomy 2:19</a>, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-5.htm">Deuteronomy 2:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>). - To confirm this, ethnographical notices are introduced again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-20.htm">Deuteronomy 2:20-22</a> into the words of God (as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-10.htm">Deuteronomy 2:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>), concerning the earlier population of the country of the Ammonites.
