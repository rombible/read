Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Emims, Horims, and Anakims, see the marginal references.

The site of it is marked by extensive mounds of rubbish.<p>Ezion-geber&#8212;now Akaba, both were within the territory of Edom; and after making a circuit of its southeastern boundary, the Israelites reached the border of Moab on the southeast of the Salt Sea. They had been forbidden by divine command to molest the Moabites in any way; and this special honor was conferred on that people not on their own account, for they were very wicked, but in virtue of their descent from Lot. (See on [113]De 23:3). Their territory comprised the fine country on the south, and partly on the north of the Arnon. They had won it by their arms from the original inhabitants, the Emims, a race, terrible, as their name imports, for physical power and stature (Ge 14:5), in like manner as the Edomites had obtained their settlement by the overthrow of the original occupiers of Seir, the Horims (Ge 14:6), who were troglodytes, or dwellers in caves. Moses alluded to these circumstances to encourage his countrymen to believe that God would much more enable them to expel the wicked and accursed Canaanites. At that time, however, the Moabites, having lost the greater part of their possessions through the usurpations of Sihon, were reduced to the small but fertile region between the Zered and the Arnon.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Emims; </span> men terrible for stature and strength, as their very name imports; see <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm" title="And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh Kiriathaim,">Genesis 14:5</a></span>; whose expulsion by the Moabites is here noted as a great encouragement to the Israelites, for whose sake he would much more drive out the wicked and accursed Canaanites. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Emims dwelt there in time past,....

In Moab dwelt, in the earlier times, the Emim, a giant race, potent and numerous, like the 'Anakim. They were also, like the 'Anakim reckoned among the Rephaim, but were by the Moabites called Emim. The word <span class="cmt_word">Emim</span> means frightful, and was given to these men probably because of their huge stature and fierce aspect. <span class="cmt_word">Anakims</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-28.htm">Deuteronomy 1:28</a>). <span class="accented">Rephaim</span> seems to have been a generic name of these gigantic Canaanitish tribes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-20.htm">Genesis 15:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The Horim</span> appear from the name (from <span class="hebrew">&#x5d7;&#x5d5;&#x5d3;</span>, a cave) to have been a Troglodyte race, inhabiting the caves which abound in the Edomite range, and with whom, perhaps, originated the conception which was at a later period carried out in the marvelous rock city of Petra.

This cannot be regarded as uttered proleptically; it must either be the insertion of a later age, or it must refer to the conquest which had actually been made before this by the Israelites of the land to the east of the Jordan. and which is, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-20.htm">Deuteronomy 3:20</a>, described as the possession which the Lord had given to the two tribes and a half to whom it had been assigned.
