Moses also gives an instance older than any of these; the Caphtorims drove the Avims out of their country. These revolutions show what uncertain things wordly possessions are. It was so of old, and ever will be so. Families decline, and from them estates are transferred to families that increase; so little continuance is there in these things. This is recorded to encourage the children of Israel. If the providence of God has done this for Moabites and Ammonites, much more would his promise do it for Israel, his peculiar people. Cautions are given not to meddle with Moabites and Ammonites. Even wicked men must not be wronged. God gives and preserves outward blessings to wicked men; these are not the best things, he has better in store for his own children.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words, "said I," are not in the Hebrew.

The territory of this people had been directly north from that of Moab. It extended as far as the Jabbok, having been taken by them from a number of small Canaanitish tribes, namely, the Zamzummins, a bullying, presumptuous band of giants, as their name indicates; and the Avims, the aborigines of the district extending from Hazerim or Hazeroth (El Hudhera) even unto Azzah (Gaza), but of which they had been dispossessed by the Caphtorim (Philistines), who came out of Caphtor (Lower Egypt) and settled in the western coast of Palestine. The limits of the Ammonites were now compressed; but they still possessed the mountainous region beyond the Jabbok (Jos 11:2). What a strange insight does this parenthesis of four verses give into the early history of Palestine! How many successive wars of conquest had swept over its early state&#8212;what changes of dynasty among the Canaanitish tribes had taken place long prior to the transactions recorded in this history!<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,....

The expression is vague and the mention of ‘Ammôn at this stage perplexing. It is true that, acc. to <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm" title="And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.">Jdg 11:13</a>, the ‘Ammonites declared to Jephthah that Israel coming out of Egypt took away their land from Arnon even unto Jabboḳ. But the passage to which this belongs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/11-12.htm" title="And Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the children of Ammon, saying, What have you to do with me, that you are come against me to fight in my land?...">Jdg 11:12-28</a>, generally regarded as late and confused, repels the ‘Ammonite claim and affirms (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-22.htm" title="As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelled in Seir, when he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and dwelled in their stead even to this day:">Deuteronomy 2:22</a></span>) that the land between Arnon and Jabboḳ had been held by the Amorites. This, too, is the testimony of the oldest traditions JE, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-13.htm" title="From there they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that comes out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.">Numbers 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm" title="And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.">Numbers 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-31.htm" title="Thus Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:31</a> f., which also relate that the Amorites had taken that territory not from ‘Ammôn, but from Mo’ab (<span class="ital">id.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-26.htm" title="For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon....">Numbers 21:26-30</a>); cp. the evidence both of JE and P in Numbers 22 ff., that the land N. of Arnon was Moabite. The evidence thus preponderates that ‘Ammôn was confined to a small territory on the upper Jabboḳ, where Rabbath-‘Ammôn (chief town of ‘A.) was situated (though before the ‘Amorite invasion of E. Palestine they may have held the whole course of Jabboḳ immediately S. of that). On the Arnon, therefore, Israel was still some 35 miles from Ammonite territory and the Amorites lay between. The mention of ‘Ammôn at this stage thus appears proleptic, and coinciding as it does with a change to the Sg. address, may plausibly be maintained to be the insertion of a later writer, perhaps influenced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-13.htm" title="And the king of the children of Ammon answered to the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even to Jabbok, and to Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again peaceably.">Jdg 11:13</a>. On the other hand it is just possible that the reference to ‘Ammôn at this stage was held by the author of the discourse himself to be necessary, as intended to divert Israel from the due northerly direction which they had been pursuing and which, if continued, would bring them into conflict with ‘Ammôn; and to turn them N.W. through the Amorites to the Jordan.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/deuteronomy/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 19.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Over against the children of Ammon</span>. As the Israelites were passing eastward of Moab; when they crossed the Arnon, the Ammonites, whose dwelling was in the wilderness east of the Jordan, would be almost in front of them. The Israelites came over against them after they conquered Sihon (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-24.htm">Numbers 21:24</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>For this reason Israel was to remove from the desert of Moab (i.e., the desert which bounded Moabitis on the east), and to cross over the brook Zered, to advance against the country of the Amorites (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/21-12.htm">Numbers 21:12-13</a>). This occurred thirty-eight years after the condemnation of the people at Kadesh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/14-23.htm">Numbers 14:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-29.htm">Numbers 14:29</a>), when the generation rejected by God had entirely died out (&#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1501;, to be all gone, to disappear), so that not one of them saw the promised land. They did not all die a natural death, however, but "the hand of the Lord was against them to destroy them" (&#1492;&#1502;&#1501;, lit., to throw into confusion, then used with special reference to the terrors with which Jehovah destroyed His enemies; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-24.htm">Exodus 14:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a>, etc.), sc., by extraordinary judgments (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-35.htm">Numbers 16:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-1.htm">Numbers 18:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-6.htm">Numbers 21:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-9.htm">Numbers 25:9</a>).</body></html>
