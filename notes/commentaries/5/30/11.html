The LXX. will not account for it. “Beyond the sea” generally suggests the idea of a land on the other side of the surface of the ocean. But a descent into the <span class= "ital">“</span>abyss,” which is what St. Paul indicates, means a passage through the sea to that which is beneath it, “beyond the sea “in a very different sense. No one but Jonah ever went beyond the sea in this way, as he says, “Out of the belly of hell cried I . . . Thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the heart of the seas . . . I went down to the bottoms of the mountains . . . The <span class= "ital">deep </span>(abyss) <span class= "ital">closed me about.” </span>And this descent of Jonah is chosen as the “sign” of Christ’s descent into hell.<p>(14) <span class= "bld">But the word is very nigh unto thee.</span>—Here the difference between the Jewish and the Christian commentator is very striking. “The Law is given you in Scripture and in tradition” (written and orally), says Rashi on this place. But St. Paul continues thus: “But what saith it (the righteousness of faith)? The word is nigh thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, that is, the word of faith which we preach; that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.” It is worthy of notice that St. Paul in this place contrasts the righteousness of faith with the righteousness of the law, and describes both alike in the words of the Pentateuch. Concerning the righteousness of the law, he says, Moses describeth it, “The man which doeth those things shall live by them.” The citation is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-5.htm" title="You shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 18:5</a>. And there is a similar passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-25.htm" title="And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all these commandments before the LORD our God, as he has commanded us.">Deuteronomy 6:25</a>. What could more clearly prove that the covenant of Deuteronomy 28, 29 was meant to present the way of salvation from a different point of view to the Sinaitic covenant, and was “beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.” Not that we are to suppose there was ever a different way of salvation. The Decalogue itself begins (like the new covenant) with “I am the Lord thy God.” But, unlike the new covenant, it makes no provision whereby Israel may keep the laws arising out of the relationship. The new covenant not only asserts the relationship, but provides the means whereby men may walk worthy of it. “I will put my laws in their mind, and write them in their heart.” (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-13.htm" title="That he may establish you to day for a people to himself, and that he may be to you a God, as he has said to you, and as he has sworn to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.">Deuteronomy 29:13</a>.)<p>It is only in the power of this principle that Moses, in the exhortation which he founds on this statement of the way of righteousness through faith, could say as he did in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-19.htm" title="I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both you and your seed may live:">Deuteronomy 30:19</a>, “therefore choose life.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/deuteronomy/30.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Deuteronomy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE SPIRIT OF THE LAW<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm" title="For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.">Deuteronomy 30:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm" title="That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.">Deuteronomy 30:20</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> This paragraph closes the legislation of this book, the succeeding chapters being in the nature of an epilogue or appendix. It sums up the whole law, makes plain its inmost essence and its tremendous alternatives. As in the closing strains of some great symphony, the themes which have run through the preceding movements are woven together in the final burst of music. Let us try to discover the component threads of the web.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The first point to note is the lofty conception of the true essence of the whole law, which is enshrined here. ‘This commandment which I command thee this day’ is twice defined in the section {vs. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-16.htm" title="In that I command you this day to love the LORD your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments, that you may live and multiply: and the LORD your God shall bless you in the land where you go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 30:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm" title="That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>}, and in both instances ‘to love Jehovah thy God’ is presented as the all-important precept. Love is recognised as the great commandment. Leviticus may deal with minute regulations for worship, but these are subordinate, and the sovereign commandment is love. Nor is the motive which should sway to love omitted; for what a tender drawing by the memories of what He had done for Israel is put forth in the name of ‘Jehovah, <span class="ital">thy</span> God!’ The Old Testament system is a spiritual system, and it too places the very heart of religion in love to God, drawn out by the contemplation of his self-revelation in his loving dealings with us. We have here clearly recognised that the obedience which pleases God is obedience born of love, and that the love which really sets towards God will, like a powerful stream, turn all the wheels of life in conformity to His will. When Paul proclaimed that ‘love is the fulfilling of the law,’ he was only repeating the teaching of this passage, when it puts ‘to walk in His ways,’ or ‘to obey His voice,’ after ‘to love Jehovah thy God.’ Obedience is the result and test of love; love is the only parent of real obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The second point strongly insisted on here is the blessedness of possessing such a knowledge as the law gives. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm" title="For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.">Deuteronomy 30:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-14.htm" title="But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.">Deuteronomy 30:14</a> present that thought in three ways. The revelation is not that of duties far beyond our capacity: ‘It is not too hard for thee.’ No doubt, complete conformity with it is beyond our powers, and entire, whole-hearted, and whole-souled love of God is not attained even by those who love Him most. Paul’s position that the law gives the knowledge of sin, just because it presents an impossible elevation in its ideal, is not opposed to the point of view of this context; for he is thinking of complete conformity as impossible, while it is thinking of real, though imperfect, obedience as within the reach of all men. No man can love as he ought; every man can love. It is blessed to have our obligations all gathered into such a commandment.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Again, the possession of the law is a blessing, because its authoritative voice ends the weary quest after some reliable guide to conduct, and we need neither try to climb to heaven, nor to traverse the wide world and cross the ocean, to find certitude and enlightenment enough for our need. They err who think of God’s commandments as grievous burdens; they are merciful guide-posts. They do not so much lay weights on our backs as give light to our eyes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Still further, the law has its echo ‘in thy heart.’ It is ‘graven on the fleshly tables of the heart,’ and we all respond to it when it gathers up all duty into ‘Thou shalt love the Lord thy God,’ and our consciences say to it, ‘Thou speakest well.’ The worst man knows it better than the best man keeps it. Blurred and illegible often, like the half-defaced inscriptions disinterred from the rubbish mounds that once were Nineveh or Babylon, that law remains written on the hearts of all men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> A further point to be well laid to heart is the merciful plainness and emphasis with which the issues that are suspended on obedience or disobedience are declared. The solemn alternatives are before every man that hears. Life or death, blessing or cursing, are held out to him, and it is for him to elect which shall be realised in his case. Of course, it may be said that the words ‘life’ and ‘death’ are here used in their merely physical sense, and that the context shows {<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-17.htm" title="But if your heart turn away, so that you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;">Deuteronomy 30:17</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-18.htm" title="I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish, and that you shall not prolong your days on the land, where you pass over Jordan to go to possess it.">Deuteronomy 30:18</a>} that life here means only ‘length of days, that thou mayest dwell in the land.’ No doubt that is so, though we can scarcely refuse to see some glimmer of a deeper conception gleaming through the words, ‘He is thy life,’ though it is but a glimmer. We have no space here to enter upon the question of how far it is now true that obedience brings material blessings. It was true for Israel, as many a sad experience that it was a bitter as well as an evil thing to forsake Jehovah was to show in the future. But though the connection between well-doing and material gain is not so clear now, it is by no means abrogated, either for nations or for individuals. Moral and religious law has social and economic consequences, and though the perplexed distribution of earthly good and ill often bewilders faith and emboldens scepticism, there still is visible in human affairs a drift towards recompensing in the world the righteous and the wicked.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But to us, with our Christian consciousness, ‘life’ means more than living, and ‘He is our life’ in a deeper and more blessed sense than that our physical existence is sustained by His continual energy. The love of God and consequent union with Him give us the only true life. Jesus is ‘our life,’ and He enters the spirit which opens to Him by faith, and communicates to it a spark of His own immortal life. He that is joined to Jesus lives; he that is separated from Him ‘is dead while he liveth.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The last point here is the solemn responsibility for choosing one’s part, which the revelation of the law brings with it. ‘I have set before thee life and death, the blessing and the curse, therefore choose life.’ We each determine for ourselves whether the knowledge of what we ought to be will lead to life or to death, and by choosing obedience we choose life. Every ray of light from God is capable of producing a double effect. It either gladdens or pains, it either gives vision or blindness. The gospel, which is the perfect revelation of God in Christ, brings every one of us face to face with the great alternative, and urgently demands from each his personal act of choice whether he will accept it or neglect or reject it. Not to choose to accept <span class="ital">is</span> to choose to reject. To do nothing is to choose death. The knowledge of the law was not enough, and neither is an intellectual reception of the gospel. The one bred Pharisees, who were ‘whited sepulchres’; the other breeds orthodox professors, who have ‘a name to live and are dead.’ The clearer our light, the heavier our responsibility. If we are to live, we have to ‘choose life’; and if we do not, by the vigorous exercise of our will, turn away from earth and self, and take Jesus for our Saviour and Lord, loving and obeying whom we love and obey God, we have effectually chosen a worse death than that of the body, and flung away a better life than that of earth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm" title="For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not hidden from you, neither is it far off.">Deuteronomy 30:11</a></span>. <span class="ital">This commandment — </span>The great command of loving and obeying God, which is the sum of the law, of which yet he doth not here speak as it is in itself, but as it is mollified and accompanied with the grace of the gospel.

It is in thy mouth, in the tongue commonly used by thee, in which thou mayest hear it read, and talk of it among thy children. It is delivered so that it is level to the understanding of the meanest. This is especially true of the gospel of Christ, to which the apostle applies it. But the word is nigh us, and Christ in that word; so that if we believe with the heart, that the promises of the Messiah are fulfilled in our Lord Jesus, and confess them with our mouth, we then have Christ with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ignorance of the requirements of the law cannot be pleaded <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-10.htm">Deuteronomy 30:10-14</a>; hence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-15.htm">Deuteronomy 30:15-20</a> life and death, good and evil, are solemnly set before the people for their own choice; and an earnest exhortation to choose the better part concludes the address.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11-14</a>. "The righteousness which is of faith" is really and truly described in these words of the Law; and, under Paul's guidance (see marginal references) we affirm was intended so to be. For the simplicity and accessibility which Moses here attributes to the Law of God neither is nor can be experimentally found in it except through the medium of faith; even though outwardly and in the letter that Law be written out for us so "that he may run that readeth," and be set forth in its duties and its sanctions as plainly as it was before the Jews by Moses. The seeming ease of the commandment, and yet its real impossibility to the natural man, form part of the qualifications of the Law to be our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-11.htm">Deuteronomy 30:11</a><p>Not hidden from thee - Rather, not too hard for thee, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-8.htm">Deuteronomy 17:8</a>.<p>Neither is it far off - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-21.htm">Luke 17:21</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>De 30:11-14. The Commandment Is Manifest.<p>11-14. For this commandment &#8230; is not hidden &#8230; neither is it far off&#8212;That law of loving and obeying God, which was the subject of Moses' discourse, was well known to the Israelites. They could not plead ignorance of its existence and requirements. It was not concealed as an impenetrable mystery in heaven, for it had been revealed; nor was it carefully withheld from the people as a dangerous discovery; for the youngest and humblest of them were instructed in those truths, which were subjects of earnest study and research among the wisest and greatest of other nations. They were not under a necessity of undertaking long journeys or distant voyages, as many ancient sages did in quest of knowledge. They enjoyed the peculiar privilege of a familiar acquaintance with it. It was with them a subject of common conversation, engraven on their memories, and frequently explained and inculcated on their hearts. The apostle Paul (Ro 10:6-8) has applied this passage to the Gospel, for the law of Christ is substantially the same as that of Moses, only exhibited more clearly in its spiritual nature and extensive application; and, accompanied with the advantages of Gospel grace, it is practicable and easy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He seems to speak of the law, or of that great command of loving and obeying God, mentioned here <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-2.htm" title="And shall return to the LORD your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;">Deu 30:2</a>,6,10,16</span>, which is the sum of the law, of which yet he doth not here speak simply, or as it is in itself, but as it is mollified and accompanied with the grace of the gospel, whereby God circumciseth men’s hearts to do this, as is expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deu 30:6</a></span>. The meaning is, that although the practice of God’s law strictly and severely be now far from us, and above our strength, yet, considering the advantage of gospel grace, whereby God enables us in some measure to our duty, and accepts of our sincere endeavours instead of perfection, and imputes Christ’s perfect righteousness unto us that believe, now it is near and easy to us.

Nor was this revelation made in some far distant place across the sea, so that any need say, <span class="cmt_word">Who will go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it, and do it?</span> On the contrary, it was very near to them, had been disclosed in words so that they could utter it with their own mouth, converse over it, and ponder it in their hearts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-19.htm">Isaiah 45:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-28.htm">Jeremiah 23:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-6.htm">Romans 10:6</a>). In the allusion to the sea, the representation is not that of depth (Targum Jon.), but that of distance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/30.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The gathering of Israel out of all the countries of the earth would then follow. Even though the rejected people should be at the end of heaven, the Lord would fetch them thence, and bring them back into the land of their fathers, and do good to the nation, and multiply them above their fathers. These last words show that the promised neither points directly to the gathering of Israel from dispersion on its ultimate conversion to Christ, nor furnishes any proof that the Jews will then be brought back to Palestine. It is true that even these words have some reference to the final redemption of Israel. This is evident from the curse of dispersion, which cannot be restricted to the Assyrian and Babylonian captivities, but includes the Roman dispersion also, in which the nation continues still; and it is still more apparent from the renewal of this promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a> and other prophetic passages. But this application is to be found in the spirit, and not in the latter. For if there is to be an increase in the number of the Jews, when gathered out of their dispersion into all the world, above the number of their fathers, and therefore above the number of the Israelites in the time of Solomon and the first monarchs of the two kingdoms, Palestine will never furnish room enough for a nation multiplied like this. The multiplication promised here, so far as it falls within the Messianic age, will consist in the realization of the promise given to Abraham, that his seed should grow into nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-6.htm">Genesis 17:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-16.htm">Genesis 17:16</a>), i.e., in the innumerable multiplication, not of the "Israel according to the flesh," but of the "Israel according to the spirit," whose land is not restricted to the boundaries of the earthly Canaan or Palestine (see p. 144). The possession of the earthly Canaan for all time is nowhere promised to the Israelitish nation in the law (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-21.htm">Deuteronomy 11:21</a>).</body></html>
