But it is observed that the same form of the verb is employed in Jeremiah with respect to Moab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-47.htm" title="Yet will I bring again the captivity of Moab in the latter days, said the LORD. Thus far is the judgment of Moab.">Jeremiah 48:47</a>). This note at least shows that the Jews look for the fulfilment of this prophecy as a thing yet to come.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/30.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-3.htm" title="That then the LORD your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the nations, where the LORD your God has scattered you.">Deuteronomy 30:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Lord will turn thy captivity — </span>That is, will bring back thy captives, as the following words imply.

This was fulfilled in part when they returned from Babylon, and will be more completely fulfilled when they shall turn from ungodliness, and believe with their heart unto righteousness in Jesus of Nazareth, as the Son of God, and true Messiah; but surely not before; for as they were cast out of their own land for rejecting him, it is not to be supposed that they will be restored to it till they receive him. Nor is there any intimation in any part of Scripture that they shall. Their repentance and reformation must precede their obtaining this mercy: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-26.htm" title="And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:">Romans 11:26</a>.

This passage refers to the prophetic warnings of the last two chapters, which have been mainly fulfilled in the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and in their dispersion to the present day; and there can be no doubt that the prophetic promise contained in these verses yet remain to come to pass. The Jewish nation shall in some future period, perhaps not very distant, be converted to the faith of Christ; and, many think, again settled in the land of Canaan. The language here used is in a great measure absolute promises; not merely a conditional engagement, but declaring an event assuredly to take place. For the Lord himself here engages to circumcise their hearts; and when regenerating grace has removed corrupt nature, and Divine love has supplanted the love of sin, they certainly will reflect, repent, return to God, and obey him; and he will rejoice in doing them good. The change that will be wrought upon them will not be only outward, or consisting in mere opinions; it will reach to their souls. It will produce in them an utter hatred of all sin, and a fervent love to God, as their reconciled God in Christ Jesus; they will love him with all their hearts, and with all their soul. They are very far from this state of mind at present, but so were the murderers of the Lord Jesus, on the day of Pentecost; who yet in one hour were converted unto God. So shall it be in the day of God's power; a nation shall be born in a day; the Lord will hasten it in his time. As a conditional promise this passage belongs to all persons and all people, not to Israel only; it assures us that the greatest sinners, if they repent and are converted, shall have their sins pardoned, and be restored to God's favour.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Will turn thy captivity - Will change or put an end to thy state of captivity or distress (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm">Psalm 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm">Psalm 85:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-18.htm">Jeremiah 30:18</a>). The rendering of the Greek version is significant; "the Lord will heal thy sins."<p>The promises of this and the following verses had no doubt their partial fulfillment in the days of the Judges; but the fact that various important features are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-37.htm">Jeremiah 32:37</a> ff, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a> ff, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13</a> ff, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a> ff, shows us that none of these was regarded as exhausting the promises. In full analogy with the scheme of prophecy we may add that the return from the Babylonian captivity has not exhausted their depth. The New Testament takes up the strain (e. g. in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/11.htm">Romans 11</a>), and foretells the restoration of Israel to the covenanted mercies of God. True these mercies shall not be, as before, confined to that nation. The "turning again of the captivity" will be when Israel is converted to Him in whom the Law was fulfilled, and who died "not for that nation only," but also that he might "gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad" <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm">John 11:51-52</a>. Then shall there be "one fold and one shepherd" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>. But whether the general conversion of the Jews shall be accompanied with any national restoration, any recovery of their ancient prerogatives as the chosen people; and further, whether there shall be any local replacement of them in the land of their fathers, may be regarded as of "the secret things" which belong unto God <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-29.htm">Deuteronomy 29:29</a>; and so indeed our Lord Himself teaches us <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1-6.htm">Acts 1:6-7</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 30<p>De 30:1-10. Great Mercies Promised unto the Penitent.<p>1-10. when all these things are come upon thee, &#8230; and thou shalt return &#8230; then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity&#8212;The hopes of the Hebrew people are ardently directed to this promise, and they confidently expect that God, commiserating their forlorn and fallen condition, will yet rescue them from all the evils of their long dispersion. They do not consider the promise as fulfilled by their restoration from the captivity in Babylon, for Israel was not then scattered in the manner here described&#8212;"among all the nations," "unto the utmost parts of heaven" (De 30:4). When God recalled them from that bondage, all the Israelites were not brought back. They were not multiplied above their fathers (De 30:5), nor were their hearts and those of their children circumcised to love the Lord (De 30:6). It is not, therefore, of the Babylonish captivity that Moses was speaking in this passage; it must be of the dispersed state to which they have been doomed for eighteen hundred years. This prediction may have been partially accomplished on the return of the Israelites from Babylon; for, according to the structure and design of Scripture prophecy, it may have pointed to several similar eras in their national history; and this view is sanctioned by the prayer of Nehemiah (Ne 1:8, 9). But undoubtedly it will receive its full and complete accomplishment in the conversion of the Jews to the Gospel of Christ. At the restoration from the Babylonish captivity, that people were changed in many respects for the better. They were completely weaned from idolatry; and this outward reformation was a prelude to the higher attainments they are destined to reach in the age of Messiah, "when the Lord God will circumcise their hearts and the hearts of their seed to love the Lord." The course pointed out seems clearly to be this: that the hearts of the Hebrew people shall be circumcised (Col 2:2); in other words, by the combined influences of the Word and spirit of God, their hearts will be touched and purified from all their superstition and unbelief. They will be converted to the faith of Jesus Christ as their Messiah&#8212;a spiritual deliverer, and the effect of their conversion will be that they will return and obey the voice (the Gospel, the evangelical law) of the Lord. The words may be interpreted either wholly in a spiritual sense (Joh 11:51, 52), or, as many think, in a literal sense also (Ro 11:1-36). They will be recalled from all places of the dispersion to their own land and enjoy the highest prosperity. The mercies and favors of a bountiful Providence will not then be abused as formerly (De 31:20; 32:15). They will be received in a better spirit and employed to nobler purposes. They will be happy, "for the Lord will again rejoice over them for good, as He rejoiced over their fathers."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Turn thy captivity, </span> i.e. bring back thy captives, as <span class="ital">captivity</span> is taken, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-7.htm" title="Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when the LORD brings back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.">Psalm 14:7</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Gather thee</span>, i.e. thy children; either spiritually such, as it is explained <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-51.htm" title="And this spoke he not of himself: but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for that nation;">John 11:51</a>,52</span>; or literally such, as it is promised <span class="bld"> Ro 11</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That then the Lord thy God will turn thy captivity, and have compassion on thee,....
