Here is election; The Lord hath chosen thee. He did not choose them because they were by their own acts a peculiar people to him above other nations, but he chose them that they might be so by his grace; and thus were believers chosen, Eph 1:4. Here is adoption; Ye are the children of the Lord your God; not because God needed children, but because they were orphans, and needed a father. Every spiritual Israelite is indeed a child of God, a partaker of his nature and favour. Here is sanctification; Thou art a holy people. God's people are required to be holy, and if they are holy, they are indebted to the grace God which makes them so. Those whom God chooses to be his children, he will form to be a holy people, and zealous of good works. They must be careful to avoid every thing which might disgrace their profession, in the sight of those who watch for their halting. Our heavenly Father forbids nothing but for our welfare. Do thyself no harm; do not ruin thy health, thy reputation, thy domestic comforts, thy peace of mind. Especially do not murder thy soul. Do not be the vile slave of thy appetites and passions. Do not render all around thee miserable, and thyself wretched; but aim at that which is most excellent and useful. The laws which regarded many sorts of flesh as unclean, were to keep them from mingling with their idolatrous neighbours. It is plain in the gospel, that these laws are now done away. But let us ask our own hearts, Are we of the children of the Lord our God? Are we separate from the ungodly world, in being set apart to God's glory, the purchase of Christ's blood? Are we subjects of the work of the Holy Ghost? Lord, teach us from these precepts how pure and holy all thy people ought to live!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The "pygarg" is a species of gazelle, and the "wild ox" and "chamois" are swift types of antelope.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

In this and the two following verses two general rules are given, by which it might be known what beasts were fit for food and what not; one is if they parted the hoof, and the other if they chewed the cud, such might be eaten; but such that only chewed the cud, but did not divide the hoof, as the camel, hare, and coney, might not be eaten; and so if they divided the hoof, and did not chew the cud, as the swine, they were alike unlawful; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-3.htm">Leviticus 11:3</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-4.htm">Leviticus 11:4</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-5.htm">Leviticus 11:5</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-6.htm">Leviticus 11:6</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-7.htm">Leviticus 11:7</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-8.htm">Leviticus 11:8</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their flesh, nor touch their dead carcass.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/deuteronomy/14.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">swine</span>] <span class="ital">ḥǎzîr</span>, Ar. <span class="ital">khanzir</span>; from the animal’s indiscriminate feeding the flesh is liable to become the host of many parasites and therefore without care dangerous especially in warm climates.

Both of these were opposed to their calling. To bring this to their mind, Moses introduces the laws which follow with the words, "ye are children to the Lord your God." The divine sonship of Israel was founded upon its election and calling as the holy nation of Jehovah, which is regarded in the Old Testament not as generation by the Spirit of God, but simply as an adoption springing out of the free love of God, as the manifestation of paternal love on the part of Jehovah to Israel, which binds the son to obedience, reverence, and childlike trust towards a Creator and Father, who would train it up into a holy people. The laws in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a> are simply a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm">Leviticus 21:5</a>. &#1500;&#1502;&#1514;, with reference to, or on account of, a dead person, is more expressive than &#1500;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; (for a soul) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>. The reason assigned for this command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm">Deuteronomy 14:2</a> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-6.htm">Deuteronomy 7:6</a>) is simply an emphatic elucidation of the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a>. (On the substance of the verse, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-5.htm">Exodus 19:5-6</a>). </body></html>
