The whole appointment evidently was against the covetousness, distrust, and selfishness of the human heart. It promoted friendliness, liberality, and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. They were taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed, when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our God will bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is all to our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of our hands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon the working hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thus scatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in the support of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way of thriving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These words recall in general terms the command of the earlier legislation respecting tithes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>), but refer more particularly to the second or festival tithe, which was an exclusively vegetable one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-27. Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed&#8212;The dedication of a tenth part of the year's produce in everything was then a religious duty. It was to be brought as an offering to the sanctuary; and, where distance prevented its being taken in kind, it was by this statute convertible into money.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/deuteronomy/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Bind up the money in thine hand, i.e. in a bag to be taken into thy hand and carried with thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/deuteronomy/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou shalt then turn it into money,.... The tithe, which would be lighter and easier carriage: <p>and bind up the money in thine hand; put it into a bag or purse, and tie it up and carry it in the hand; which some think was ordered, that it might not be mixed with other money; but it seems only to have respect to journeying, and making it fit for that. The Jewish writers (u), some of them, give a different sense of the word we render "bind up", and interpret it of marking the silver, or impressing a form, figure, or image on it with the hand; they mean that it must be coined money; so Maimonides (w), they may not profane the sacred tithe with money not coined, nor with money not current, nor with money which is not in a man's power; for it is said: <p>in thine hand; which the man is possessed of and is his own property: <p>and shalt go unto the place which the Lord that God shall choose; carrying the money along with him, for which he sold the tithe. <p>(u) Bartenora in Misn.
