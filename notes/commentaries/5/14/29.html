Rashi’s opinion is worth notice chiefly for the following reason. Some modern critics insist that the Law of Deuteronomy is contradictory to that of Numbers in respect of tithe; but if the Jews, who kept the whole Law strictly, not only saw no discrepancy between its several precepts, but actually took the precept in Deuteronomy to imply the precept in Numbers, why should we go out of our way to make difficulties now? If the precepts were harmonious and compatible, why should they be the work of different men? It is hardly likely that a whole nation would consent to <span class= "ital">pay double tithes</span>, <span class= "ital">and acknowledge the obligation to do so by perpetual enactment, if the laws that commanded the tithe were contradictory. </span>And the more closely we look at the subject, the more clearly will the distinction between the first and second tithes appear. The first was only an ordinary rate for the support of the Levitical ministry. No sacredness attached to it. The second was a tithe taken for Jehovah, “that thou mayest learn to fear Jehovah thy God always” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-23.htm" title="And you shall eat before the LORD your God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of your corn, of your wine, and of your oil, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks; that you may learn to fear the LORD your God always.">Deuteronomy 14:23</a>). The tithe was either to be a joyful feast for the family, or a special gift to God’s poor. It furnished a table spread by the God of Israel for the entertainment of His guests. Why this should be confused with the ordinary rate for the maintenance of the Levitical ministry, it is not easy to understand.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/deuteronomy/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-29.htm" title="And the Levite, (because he has no part nor inheritance with you,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, which are within your gates, shall come, and shall eat and be satisfied; that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hand which you do.">Deuteronomy 14:29</a></span>. <span class="ital">The stranger, the fatherless, and the widow — </span>For this tithe was not to be spent merely in feasting themselves, but for the relief of such as were in want, who otherwise might have been compelled to beg, or to serve strangers, and thereby be in danger of being perverted from their religion.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-29 A second portion from the produce of their land was required.

It promoted friendliness, liberality, and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. They were taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed, when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our God will bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is all to our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of our hands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon the working hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thus scatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in the support of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way of thriving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the marginal references. The tithe thus directed in the third year to be dispensed in charity at home, was not paid in addition to that in other years bestowed on the sacred meals, but was substituted for it. The three years would count from the sabbatical year (see the next chapter), in which year there would of course be neither payment of tithe nor celebration of the feasts at the sanctuary. In the third year and sixth year of the septennial cycle the feasts would be superseded by the private hospitality enjoined in these verses. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28, 29.

No religious offering under the name of tithe appears in the earlier legislation, the Holiness Code (Leviticus 17-26), or Ezekiel. Yet all these require an offering of the firstfruits of the soil:—E, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-29.htm" title="You shall not delay to offer the first of your ripe fruits, and of your liquors: the firstborn of your sons shall you give to me.">Exodus 22:29</a> (28), <span class="ital">thou shalt not delay thy fulness nor thy trickling</span> (see Driver’s note), LXX <span class="ital">firstfruits of thy threshing-floor and wine-press</span>, like D’s law of tithes associated with firstlings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-30.htm" title="Likewise shall you do with your oxen, and with your sheep: seven days it shall be with his dam; on the eighth day you shall give it me.">Exodus 22:30</a> (29); H, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-11.htm" title="And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.">Leviticus 23:11</a> demands merely a sheaf of the firstfruits (<span class="ital">reshîth</span>) of harvest; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-40.htm" title="For in my holy mountain, in the mountain of the height of Israel, said the Lord GOD, there shall all the house of Israel, all of them in the land, serve me: there will I accept them, and there will I require your offerings, and the first fruits of your oblations, with all your holy things.">Ezekiel 20:40</a>, <span class="ital">I will require your contributions</span> (<span class="ital">terumôth</span>) <span class="ital">and the firstfruits</span> (<span class="ital">reshîth</span>) <span class="ital">of your oblations</span>.

Arch.</span> ii. 257 ff.), cp. the synonymousness of <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχαί</span> and <span class="greekheb">δεκάται</span>, Dion Halic. i. 23 f. and Philo’s <span class="greekheb">ἀπαρχῆς ἀπαρχή</span> for the priests’ <span class="ital">tithe</span> of the Levites’ <span class="ital">tithe</span> in P (<span class="ital">De Mut. Nom.</span> 1607, Mangey); (2) that the same offering was called <span class="ital">firstfruits</span> at some sanctuaries, <span class="ital">tithes</span> at others (Now., G. F. Moore, <span class="ital">E.B.</span> art. ‘Tithes’ § 1); (3) that <span class="ital">tithes</span> is the later name (W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Rel. Sem.</span> 226 ff.); (4) that the use of this name at Bethel, a royal sanctuary, was due to the appropriation of the king’s tithe to the support of the shrine, the result of Phoenician influence in N. Israel, for the earliest reference to a religious tithe is Phoenician (<span class="ital">ibid.</span>); (5) that these <span class="ital">tithes</span> were the material of a feast for not only the offerers but all the worshippers, including the poor, whose rights to them were sometimes cruelly absorbed by the rich (<span class="ital">ibid.</span>). What is sure is that from the time of their settlement Israel shared the belief of many primitive peoples (Frazer, <span class="ital">Golden Bough</span>2, ii. 459) that they might not enjoy their harvests till they offered the Deity some of the firstfruits. This was done at the local sanctuaries and became the occasion of a joyful feast, in which the officiating priest, the poor and all who had <span class="ital">gêr</span>, or guest, rights at the sanctuary would share. At some places these offerings were called <span class="ital">tithes</span>, either because it was found to be necessary to fix their proportion to the whole harvest, or because the royal <span class="ital">tithe</span> was actually appropriated to the support of the sanctuary and the solemn entertainment of the worshipping guests.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The tithe-laws of D imply that some such custom prevailed at the rural sanctuaries; but like many others it had to be adapted to D’s law of One Sanctuary. This was done by dividing the tithe between religious and charitable uses. Two years out of three the Israelite farmer must take the <span class="ital">tithe</span>, either in kind or in money, to the one sanctuary and (that he might learn to fear God) eat it there before God, with his household and the Levite, who by the abolition of his shrine had lost his opportunity of eating before God. But this deprived both the latter and the other landless poor of their rights in what had included benefactions for them all. Therefore every third year (see on 28 f.) <span class="ital">all</span> the tithe was to be stored and reserved for their sustenance, without any religious rites, either in the offering of it (except the prayer <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deuteronomy 26:12</a> ff.), or in their enjoyment of it (note the omission in 28 f. of <span class="ital">eating before Jehovah</span>). Some think indeed that this third year tithe is the oldest element in D’s law and in fact had been the only real tithe (cp. the expression <span class="ital">the year of tithing</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-12.htm" title="When you have made an end of tithing all the tithes of your increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and have given it to the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, that they may eat within your gates, and be filled;">Deuteronomy 26:12</a>). But all that is older in it is the right of the Levite and the poor and the <span class="ital">gçrîm</span> to a share of the annual tithes offered at the local sanctuaries. When these were disestablished and the purely religious interests involved in the tithe could only be satisfied at the One Sanctuary, D compensated the rural Levites and the poor by granting them the whole of the third year’s tithe.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In P the tithe-law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/18-21.htm" title="And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation....">Numbers 18:21-32</a>, is very different. <span class="ital">All the tithe in Israel, the tithe of the children of Israel which they offer as a contribution to Jehovah</span> is given as an <span class="ital">inheritance</span> to the landless Levites, for <span class="ital">the service which they serve, even the service of the tent of the meeting</span>, the central sanctuary, and they in turn are to give a tithe of this tithe to Aaron the priest. And this was that part of <span class="ital">the law of God given by Moses</span> and sworn to by the people under Nehemiah, according to which they were to bring in the tithes of their ground to the Levites—<span class="ital">the Levites take the tithes in all the townships of our tillage</span>—and the Levites were to bring the tithe of their tithe to the house of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/10-37.htm" title="And that we should bring the first fruits of our dough, and our offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and of oil, to the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and the tithes of our ground to the Levites, that the same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our tillage.">Nehemiah 10:37</a> f.). These injunctions are irreconcileable with those of D. The tithe, which in D is enjoyed by the offerers, by the Levites of the rural sanctuaries, and by the poor and the <span class="ital">gçrîm</span>, is in P the <span class="ital">inheritance</span> of the Levites at the central sanctuary. D and P represent not, only differing practices, but incompatible principles of practice. Which is the earlier of the two? It is of course possible to argue that the original disposition of the tithe was purely religious or ecclesiastical and that D represents a later and more liberal spirit, which extended the enjoyment of it to the laity. But the converse is far more probable in view of that steady increase of all the priests’ establishments and revenues—with the consequent encroachments on the rights of the people—which is so fully illustrated in the historical Books. For an interesting and suggestive discussion of the problems arising from this subject see ‘The Deuteronomic Tithe’ by Prof. J. M. Powis Smith in <span class="ital">The Amer. Journ. of Theology</span>, January, 1914.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As the Israelites were to sanctify their food, on the one hand, positively by abstinence from everything unclean, so were they, on the other hand, to do so negatively by delivering the tithes and firstlings at the place where the Lord would cause His name to dwell, and by holding festal meals on the occasion, and rejoicing there before Jehovah their God. This law is introduced with the general precept, "Thou shalt tithe all the produce of thy seed which groweth out of the field (&#1497;&#1510;&#1488; construes with an accusative, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/9-10.htm">Genesis 9:10</a>, etc.) year by year" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1492;, i.e., every year; cf. Ewald, 313, a.), which recalls the earlier laws concerning the tithe (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-21.htm">Numbers 18:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>.), without repeating them one by one, for the purpose of linking on the injunction to celebrate sacrificial meals at the sanctuary from the tithes and firstlings. Moses had already directed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>.) that all the sacrificial meals should take place at the sanctuary, and had then alluded to the sacrificial meals to be prepared from the tithes, though only causally, because he intended to speak of them more fully afterwards. This he does here, and includes the firstlings also, inasmuch as the presentation of them was generally associated with that of the tithes, though only causally, as he intends to revert to the firstlings again, which he does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-19.htm">Deuteronomy 15:19</a>. The connection between the tithes of the fruits of the ground and the firstlings of the cattle which were devoted to the sacrificial meals, and the tithes and first-fruits which were to be delivered to the Levites and priests, we have already discussed at <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12.htm">Deuteronomy 12</a>. The sacrificial meals were to be held before the Lord, in the place where He caused His name to dwell (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-5.htm">Deuteronomy 12:5</a>), that Israel might learn to fear Jehovah its God always; not, however, as Schultz supposes, that by the confession of its dependence upon Him it might accustom itself more and more to the feeling of dependence. For the fear of the Lord is not merely a feeling of dependence upon Him, but also includes the notion of divine blessedness, which is the predominant idea here, as the sacrificial meals were to furnish the occasion and object of the rejoicing before the Lord. The true meaning therefore is, that Israel might rejoice with holy reverence in the fellowship of its God. </body></html>
