This was to be done two years; but in the third and sixth years there was a different arrangement (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-28.htm" title="At the end of three years you shall bring forth all the tithe of your increase the same year, and shall lay it up within your gates:">Deuteronomy 14:28</a>). In the seventh year, which was Sabbatical, there would probably be no tithe, for there was to be no harvest. The profit of the earth was for all, and every one was free to eat at pleasure.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/deuteronomy/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-29 A second portion from the produce of their land was required. The whole appointment evidently was against the covetousness, distrust, and selfishness of the human heart. It promoted friendliness, liberality, and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. They were taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed, when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our God will bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is all to our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of our hands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon the working hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thus scatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in the support of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way of thriving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These words recall in general terms the command of the earlier legislation respecting tithes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>), but refer more particularly to the second or festival tithe, which was an exclusively vegetable one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-27.

There is no reference here to an animal tithe. ‘Mere firstlings, set apart from the yearly increase of the herds, distinct from the firstborn and offered as a substitute for the animal tithe, are not to be thought of’ (Dillm.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that thou mayest learn to fear</span>] Such regular offerings mean the practice of the fear of God, for by them the offerers acknowledge that to God and not to their own labour the blessings of their fields are due. The same intention is attributed to making the people hear God’s word, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-10.htm" title="Specially the day that you stood before the LORD your God in Horeb, when the LORD said to me, Gather me the people together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they shall live on the earth, and that they may teach their children.">Deuteronomy 4:10</a> (<span class="ital">q.v.</span>), and to the injunction to the king to read always in the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-19.htm" title="And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God, to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do them:">Deuteronomy 17:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">24 f</span>.

Was there, then, no tithe when the harvest failed?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shalt thou turn it into money</span>] Heb. may mean either <span class="ital">give it in</span>, or <span class="ital">in exchange for, money</span>. The Heb. <span class="ital">keseph</span> often = <span class="ital">silver</span>, usually supposed to have been called so from its paleness (W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Journ. Phil.</span> xiv. 125); but the root is just as probably <span class="ital">to cut off</span>, or <span class="ital">cut in pieces</span> (<span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, i. 329), and <span class="ital">keseph</span> is therefore applicable, and is applied, to other metals. In any case <span class="ital">money</span> is the right translation here. Coins proper were not in use in Israel before the Persian period; but from a very early date there was a metallic currency, partly in silver (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-8.htm" title="And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.">1 Samuel 9:8</a>, <span class="ital">quarter of a silver shekel</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm" title="And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.">2 Samuel 14:26</a>, shekels stamped by David) and partly in copper (which was current in Palestine by 1400 b.c., Tell-el-Amarna Letters); of the latter the <span class="ital">gera</span> or 20th part of the shekel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-12.htm" title="And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.">Ezekiel 45:12</a>, was no doubt one form. On the currency in W. Asia see A. R. S. Kennedy in Hastings’ <span class="ital">D.B.</span> art. ‘Money.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">thou shalt bind up the money in thine hand</span>] Heb. <span class="ital">confine</span>. As the Heb. for purse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-35.htm" title="And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold, every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid.">Genesis 42:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/7-20.htm" title="He has taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at the day appointed.">Proverbs 7:20</a>) comes from another form of this root, we might use the Eng. denom. vb. <span class="ital">thou shalt purse it in thine hand</span>. Usually money was carried in the girdle, but this seems to imply a form of purse attached to the fingers or wrist.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/deuteronomy/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With reference to food, the Israelites were to eat nothing whatever that was abominable.
