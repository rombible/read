The whole appointment evidently was against the covetousness, distrust, and selfishness of the human heart. It promoted friendliness, liberality, and cheerfulness, and raised a fund for the relief of the poor. They were taught that their worldly portion was most comfortably enjoyed, when shared with their brethren who were in want. If we thus serve God, and do good with what we have, it is promised that the Lord our God will bless us in all the works of our land. The blessing of God is all to our outward prosperity; and without that blessing, the work of our hands will bring nothing to pass. The blessing descends upon the working hand. Expect not that God should bless thee in thy idleness and love of ease. And it descends upon the giving hand. He who thus scatters, certainly increases; and to be free and generous in the support of religion, and any good work, is the surest and safest way of thriving.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>These words recall in general terms the command of the earlier legislation respecting tithes (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-30.htm">Leviticus 27:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/18-26.htm">Numbers 18:26</a>), but refer more particularly to the second or festival tithe, which was an exclusively vegetable one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/deuteronomy/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22-27.
