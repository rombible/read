Here is election; The Lord hath chosen thee. He did not choose them because they were by their own acts a peculiar people to him above other nations, but he chose them that they might be so by his grace; and thus were believers chosen, Eph 1:4. Here is adoption; Ye are the children of the Lord your God; not because God needed children, but because they were orphans, and needed a father. Every spiritual Israelite is indeed a child of God, a partaker of his nature and favour. Here is sanctification; Thou art a holy people. God's people are required to be holy, and if they are holy, they are indebted to the grace God which makes them so. Those whom God chooses to be his children, he will form to be a holy people, and zealous of good works. They must be careful to avoid every thing which might disgrace their profession, in the sight of those who watch for their halting. Our heavenly Father forbids nothing but for our welfare. Do thyself no harm; do not ruin thy health, thy reputation, thy domestic comforts, thy peace of mind. Especially do not murder thy soul. Do not be the vile slave of thy appetites and passions. Do not render all around thee miserable, and thyself wretched; but aim at that which is most excellent and useful. The laws which regarded many sorts of flesh as unclean, were to keep them from mingling with their idolatrous neighbours. It is plain in the gospel, that these laws are now done away. But let us ask our own hearts, Are we of the children of the Lord our God? Are we separate from the ungodly world, in being set apart to God's glory, the purchase of Christ's blood? Are we subjects of the work of the Holy Ghost? Lord, teach us from these precepts how pure and holy all thy people ought to live!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/deuteronomy/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make any baldness between your eyes - i. e. by shaving the forepart of the head and the eyebrows.

The making a large bare space between the eyebrows was another heathen custom in honor of the dead (see on [128]Le 19:27, 28; [129]Le 21:5). Such indecorous and degrading usages, being extravagant and unnatural expressions of hopeless sorrow (1Th 4:13), were to be carefully avoided by the Israelites, as derogatory to the character, and inconsistent with the position, of those who were the people of God [De 14:2].Heathenish rites of mourning prohibited, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm" title="You are the children of the LORD your God: you shall not cut yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead.">Deu 14:1</a>,2</span>; and the eating of any abominable thing, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-3.htm" title="You shall not eat any abominable thing.">Deu 14:3</a></span>.

Some of them were so by the special grace of adoption, and all of them by national adoption; which was the peculiar privilege of the people of Israel, and laid them under great obligation to honour and obey the Lord their God, who stood in the relation of a father to them, and they of children to him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/1-6.htm">Malachi 1:6</a>. The Targum of Jonathan paraphrases it "beloved children"; so the apostle calls the saints; the "dear children of God", who therefore ought to be followers of him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-1.htm">Ephesians 5:1</a> and for a like reason this relation is observed here, namely, to quicken a regard to the exhortations of the Lord, his cautions, commands, laws, and ordinances, particularly to what follows: <p>ye shall not cut yourselves; for the dead, as appears from the next clause, as the Heathens did, who not only tore their garments, but their flesh in several parts of their bodies, in their mouths, cheeks, breasts, &amp;c. (r); and used other extravagant signs of mourning, which the apostle cautions against, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:13</a> and were condemned by the Heathens themselves (s). Though some think this refers to incisions the Heathens made in their flesh to the honour of their gods, cutting the names of them therein to whom they devoted themselves; or lashing their bodies at the worship of them, as the worshippers of Baal did when they called upon him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm">1 Kings 18:28</a> and so the Jerusalem Targum,"make not marks, marks,''that is, here and there, in many places, or bruises black and blue by striping and beating themselves, for strange worship, or at it, in honour of their gods; but the former sense seems best to agree with what follows; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>, <p>nor make any baldness between your eyes for the dead; by shaving the forepart of their head or their eyebrows, or both, which used to be done in lamentations for the dead; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-6.htm">Jeremiah 16:6</a> if this could be thought to have any respect to rites and ceremonies used in the worship of dead and lifeless idols, the customs of the Egyptians might be referred to, who are said to shave their heads and their eyebrows in their sacred rites to Isis (t). <p>(r) Vid.

Note not merely the change to the Pl. address but its cause, the conception of individual Israelites as the sons of Jehovah: not elsewhere in D. In the discourses in D Israel, the nation, is as the son of Jehovah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-31.htm" title="And in the wilderness, where you have seen how that the LORD your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came into this place.">Deuteronomy 1:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-5.htm" title="You shall also consider in your heart, that, as a man chastens his son, so the LORD your God chastens you.">Deuteronomy 8:5</a> and so more definitely in J, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm" title="And you shall say to Pharaoh, Thus said the LORD, Israel is my son, even my firstborn:">Exodus 4:22</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm" title="When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.">Hosea 11:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-20.htm" title="Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy on him, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 31:20</a>. The transition from this conception to the statement of Jehovah’s fatherhood of Israelites as individuals was natural; the two conceptions occur together in the Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/32-5.htm" title="They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation....">Deuteronomy 32:5-6</a> and in Hosea and Jeremiah. The latter is already found in the 8th century, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm" title="Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said to them, You are not my people, there it shall be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.">Hosea 1:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm" title="Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD has spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.">Isaiah 1:2</a>. But as we advance through the prophecies of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, with their strong individualism, to the exilic and post-exilic writings we find a great increase of references to Israelites as the sons of Jehovah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-14.htm" title="Turn, O backsliding children, said the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion:">Jeremiah 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-19.htm" title="But I said, How shall I put you among the children, and give you a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, You shall call me, My father; and shall not turn away from me.">Jeremiah 3:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-22.htm" title="Return, you backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.

This is contemporary with the breaking up of the Jewish state and the destruction of the national worship. While then it is clear that one cannot take <span class="ital">sons of Jehovah</span> in this law as by itself proof of an exilic or post-exilic date, we can say that if it does not add to, it at least agrees with, the evidence in that direction adduced in the note below.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Many ancient nations believed in their descent from gods or demigods; and among them the Semitic peoples, e.g. the Moabites are called sons and daughters of Kemosh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>. But the relation was conceived physically. In the O.T. God’s fatherhood and Israel’s sonship are historical and ethical, based not on physical generation, but on an act of love on God’s part, on His choice or adoption (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a>) of the people, and on His deliverance of them from Egypt; and it is carried out by His providence of love and moral chastisement (see the references above and cp. Amos 3), which is nowhere more tenderly described than in this Book. But when all the O.T. references to God as the Father whether of Israel or Israelites and to them as His children have been reckoned up, how few are they in comparison to the number of times that <span class="ital">sons</span>, and <span class="ital">children</span>, of God occur in the N.T. <span class="ital">God hath sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts crying Abba Father</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-6.htm" title="And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.">Galatians 4:6</a>); <span class="ital">joint heirs with Christ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-17.htm" title="And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.">Romans 8:17</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">ye shall not cut</span> or <span class="bld">gash</span> <span class="ital">yourselves</span>] So of the priests of Ba‘al (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-28.htm" title="And they cried aloud, and cut themselves after their manner with knives and lancets, till the blood gushed out on them.">1 Kings 18:28</a>) and in Ar. one form of the vb. is used of mutilations of animals, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm" title="You shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor print any marks on you: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:28</a> : <span class="ital">you shall put no incision on your flesh</span> (cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-5.htm" title="And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the LORD your God has chosen to minister to him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried:">Deuteronomy 21:5</a>) nor <span class="ital">any tattooing upon you</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nor</span> <span class="bld">set a</span> <span class="ital">baldness between your eyes</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-5.htm" title="They shall not make baldness on their head, neither shall they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any cuttings in their flesh.">Leviticus 21:5</a> : <span class="ital">not make a baldness on their head neither shave off the corner of their beard</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the dead</span>] That these customs were not practised merely from excess of grief, nor only as testifying to the continuance of the mourner’s blood-covenant with the dead, but also in acknowledgement of the divinity of the latter and as the mourners’ consecration to them, is implied in the reason given in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-2.htm" title="For you are an holy people to the LORD your God, and the LORD has chosen you to be a peculiar people to himself, above all the nations that are on the earth.">Deuteronomy 14:2</a></span> for Israel’s abstention from such things.

Moreover <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm" title="Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother.">Jeremiah 16:7</a> describes a communion feast as part of the same rites.
