Dancing was one of the rites practised by the heathen in the worship of their gods.

And it was the more proper for the apostle to caution the Corinthians against it, because in their heathen state they had practised it even as an act of worship, acceptable to their deities; nay, and after their conversion, some of them, it appears, had not altered their manners in that particular, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And lest, when I come again, my God will humble me among you, and that I shall mourn many which have sinned already, and have not repented of the uncleanness and fornication and lasciviousness which they have committed.">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>. <span class="ital">As some of them committed </span>— With the Midianitish women, when they partook of the sacrifices offered to Baal-peor: the sad consequence of which was, that there <span class="ital">fell in one day three and twenty thousand — </span>By the plague, besides the princes who were afterward hanged, and those whom the judges slew; so that there died in all twenty-four thousand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/25-1.htm" title="And Israel stayed in Shittim, and the people began to commit prostitution with the daughters of Moab....">Numbers 25:1-9</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 Carnal desires gain strength by indulgence, therefore should be checked in their first rise. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun their plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither be ye idolaters - This caution is evidently given in view of the danger to which they would be exposed if they partook of the feasts that were celebrated in honor of idols in their temples. The particular idolatry which is referred to here is, the worship of the golden calf that was made by Aaron <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/32-1.htm">Exodus 32:1-5</a>.<p>As it is written - <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a>.<p>The people sat down to eat and to drink - To worship the golden calf. They partook of a feast in honor of that idol. I have already observed that it was common to keep a feast in honor of an idol, and that the food which was eaten on such an occasion was mainly the meat which had been offered in sacrifice to it. This instance was particularly to the apostle's purpose, as he was cautioning the Corinthians against the danger of participating in the feasts celebrated in the pagan temples.<p>And rose up to play - (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;  paizein). The Hebrew word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a> (&#1510;&#1495;&#1511;  tsaachaq) means "to laugh, to sport, to jest, to mock, to insult" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-9.htm">Genesis 21:9</a>; and then to engage in dances accompanied with music, in honor of an idol. This was often practiced, as the worship of idols was celebrated with songs and dances. This is particularly affirmed of this instance of idol worship <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-19.htm">Exodus 32:19</a>; and this was common among ancient idolaters; and this mode of worship was even adopted by David before the ark of the Lord; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-29.htm">1 Chronicles 15:29</a>. All that the word "to play" here necessarily implies is, that of choral songs and dances, accompanied with revelry in honor of the idol. It was, however, the fact that such worship was usually accompanied with much licentiousness; but that is not necessarily implied in the use of the word. Most of the oriental dances were grossly indecent and licentious, and the word here may be designed to include such indelicacy and licentiousness. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. idolaters&#8212;A case in point.

To which they seemed inclined to be, at least there was great danger that such they would be, by carrying their liberty to such a pitch, as to sit in an idol's temple, and there eat things sacrificed unto them; and which the apostle cautions against, and uses arguments to dissuade them from in the following part of this chapter: <p>as were some of them, as it is written, the people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play: referring to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm">Exodus 32:6</a> when the Israelites, whilst Moses was in the mount, made a molten calf, and worshipped it, built an altar before it, and instituted a feast and a play; and which was performed by dancing about the calf, and singing to the honour of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-18.htm">Exodus 32:18</a> for their sitting down to eat and drink is not to be understood of an ordinary meal, but of a feast kept in honour of the golden calf, and which they covered by calling it a feast to the Lord; and their playing also was on the same account, in imitation of the Heathens, who made feasts, and appointed plays to the honour of their deities: some indeed interpret (t) this last action of uncleanness, which they committed after their feast was over, and which also was sometimes done in the Heathen temples, the word being sometimes used in this sense; see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-14.htm">Genesis 39:14</a> but others understand it of the act of idolatry; so two of the Chaldee paraphrases interpret the words in Exodus (u); "they rose up to play", , in strange service, i.e. idolatry; and though the apostle does not mention their punishment, yet it was a very great one, three thousand persons fell the sword on that account, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-28.htm">Exodus 32:28</a>. <p>(t) Vid.
