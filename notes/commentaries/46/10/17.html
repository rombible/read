There is one bread, it is broken into many pieces, and as we all (though each receives only a fragment) partake of the one bread which unbroken consisted of these pieces, we though many individuals are one body, even the Body of Christ with whom, as well as with each other, we have communion in that act.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we - We Christians. "Being many." Greek "The many" (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  hoi polloi). This idea is not, as our translation would seem to indicate, that Christians were numerous, but that "all" (for &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#769;  hoi polloi is here evidently used in the sense of &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  pantes, "all") were united, and constituted one society.<p>Are one bread - One loaf; one cake. That is, we are united, or are one. There is evident allusion here to the fact that the loaf or cake was composed of many separate grains of wheat, or portions of flour united in one; or, that as one loaf was broken and partaken by all, it was implied that they were all one. We are all one society; united as one, and for the same object. Our partaking of the same bread is an emblem of the fact that we are one. In almost all nations the act of eating together has been regarded as a symbol of unity or friendship.<p>And one body - One society; united together.<p>For we are all partakers ... - And we thus show publicly that we are united, and belong to the same great family. The argument is, that if we partake of the feasts in honor of idols with their worshippers, we shall thus show that we are a part of their society. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. one bread&#8212;rather, "loaf."

And they declare themselves to be one body, by their joint partaking <span class="ital">of that one bread.</span> Some have from hence fetched an argument to prove the unlawfulness of communicating with scandalous sinners at the Lord’s table, because we declare ourselves one body with those that communicate: but whether it will (if examined) be cogent enough, I doubt; for <span class="ital">one body</span> signifieth no more than one church, and that not invisible, but visible. So as we only declare ourselves to be fellow members of the visible church with those with whom we partake in that ordinance, and the visible church may consist of persons that are bad mixed with the good. So as though, undoubtedly, scandalously wicked persons ought to be excluded from the holy table, yea, and no unbeliever hath a right to it; yet it may reasonably be doubted, whether those that partake with unbelievers, do by it own themselves to be unbelievers; they only own themselves members of that church wherein there are some unbelievers. But the scope of the apostle is from hence to argue, that by a parity of reason, those that communicated with an idolatrous assembly in their sacrifices, declared themselves by that action to be one body with those idolaters. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For we being many, are one bread and one body,.... The several members of the church of Christ; particular believers are indeed many, considered in themselves, in their own persons; yet by virtue of their union to Christ, which is manifested by their communion with him, they are one bread with him, the bread of life, and one body with his, signified by the bread; they are of one and the same mass and lump, they are incorporated together, they are flesh of his flesh, and one spirit with him: or they are one bread and body among themselves; as bread consists of many grains of corn which have been ground and kneaded together, and make up one loaf; and as the members of an human body are many, and make up one body; so believers, though they are many, yet are one body, of which Christ is the head; one in union with him and one another, and one in their communion together at the Lord's table; and so the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "as therefore the bread is one, so we all are one body"; having communion with Christ and one another: <p>for we are all partakers of that one bread; in the supper, which is all of the same nature and kind, and is a symbol of the body of Christ, and our fellowship with him and each other. The application designed is this, that as believers, by partaking of the same bread, appear to be the same body, and of the same mass and lump with one another; so such as eat things sacrificed unto idols, appear to be of the same mass and lump with Heathen idolaters: Dr. Lightfoot has very pertinently produced some passages out of Maimonides, concerning mixing, associating, or communion of neighbours in courts on sabbath eves, that so they may enter into each other's houses on the sabbath day, for the illustration of this passage; of which mixing the Jews have a whole treatise in their Misna and Talmud, which they call Erubin; and of which they say (h). <p>"but how is this mixture or association? it is thus, they mix together, , "in one food", which they prepare on the eve of the sabbath; and it is as if they should say, for we are all mixed together, and have all one food; nor does anyone of us divide the right from his neighbour--they do not mix in courts, but  "with a whole loaf" only; though the mass or lump baked may be the quantity of a "seah", yet if it is broken, they do not associate with it; but if it is whole, though it be but the value of a farthing, they mix with it--how do they mix or associate together in the courts? they collect   , "one whole cake", out of every house, and put all in one vessel, in one of the houses of the court--and the whole association being gathered together, blesses the Lord--and eats:'' <p>upon which the above learned writer observes, that if it were customary among the Israelites, to join together in one political or economical body, by the eating of many loaves collected from this, and that, and the other man; we are much more associated together into one body, by eating one and the same bread, appointed us by our Saviour. <p>(h) Maimon.

This union into one body through participation in the one bread could not take place unless this bread were <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of the body of Christ, which is just that which produces the one body—that which constitutes the many into this unity. The proof advances <span class="ital">ab effectu</span> (which participating in the one bread <span class="ital">in and of itself</span> could not have) <span class="ital">ad causam</span> (which can only lie in this, that this bread is the communion of Christ’s body).

The <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἹ ΓᾺΡ ΠΆΝΤΕς</span></span></span>, too, forbids our supplying <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΣΜΈΝ</span></span></span> after <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΡΤΟς</span></span></span> (Zwingli, Piscator, Mosheim, Stolz, Schrader, comp Ewald); for these words indicate the presence of another conception, inasmuch as, repeating the idea conveyed in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἿς ἌΡΤΟς</span></span></span>, they thereby show that that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἿς ἌΡΤΟς</span></span></span> was said of <span class="ital">literal</span> bread.

In that case either we should have a further exposition about the bread (Hofmann), no sign of which, however, follows; or else this whole thought would be purely parenthetical, a practical conclusion being drawn in passing from what had just been stated. But how remote from the connection would such a side-thought be! And would not Paul have required to interpose an <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, or some such word, after the <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, in order to avoid misunderstanding? Interpreters would not have betaken themselves to a device so foreign to the scope of the passage, had they not too hastily assumed that <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a> contained no explanation at all of what preceded it (Rückert). Rodatz agrees with the rest in rendering: “because there is one bread, therefore are we, the many, one body,” but makes this not a subordinate thought brought in by the way, but an essentially <span class="ital">new</span> point in the argument; he does this, however, by supplying after <span class="greekheb">ἓν σῶμα</span>, “<span class="ital">with Christ the Head</span>” (comp also van Hengel, <span class="ital">Annot.</span> p. 167 f.), and finding the <span class="ital">progress</span> of the thought in the words supplied. But in this way the very point on which all turned would be left to be filled in, which is quite unwarrantable; Paul would have needed to write <span class="greekheb">ἓν σῶμα αὐτοῦ τῆς κεφαλῆς</span>, or something to that effect, in order to be understood.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ πολλοί</span>] correlative to the <span class="greekheb">ἓν σῶμα</span> (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>): <span class="ital">the many</span>, who are fellow-participants in the Lord’s Supper, <span class="ital">the Christian multitude</span>.

The thought of the bread having become a unity out of many separate grains of corn is foreign to the connection, although insisted on by many expositors, such as Chrysostom, Augustine, Erasmus, Calovius, <span class="ital">al</span>[1680]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ ἑνὸς ἄρτου μετέχ</span>. is interpreted by some as if there were no <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span>: “since we are all partakers of one bread” (Luther).

The linguistically correct rendering is: <span class="ital">for we all have a share from the one bread</span>, so that in analysing the passage we have to supply, according to a well-known usage (Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut.

Calvin reminds us that here St Paul is not dealing so much with our love towards and fellowship with one another, as with our spiritual union with Christ, in order to draw the inference that it is an unendurable sacrilege for Christians to be polluted by communion with idols.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">since</span>) He proves, that the cup and the bread are the <span class="ital">communion;</span> for the bread by itself does not make them that eat it, become one body; but the bread does so, in so far as it is <span class="ital">communion</span>, etc.—<span class="greekheb">εἷς ἄρτος</span> (<span class="ital">one bread</span>), viz. <span class="ital">there is</span> [<span class="ital">and indeed it is such bread as is broken, and carries with it</span> (implies in the participation of it) the communion <span class="ital">of the body of Christ</span>.—V. g.]—<span class="greekheb">οἱ πολλοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">the many</span>) believers [Eng.

This is the metaphor used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm">1 Corinthians 12:12, 13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-5.htm">Romans 12:5</a>. The more difficult expression, "<span class="accented">we</span> <span class="accented">are one bread,"</span> is explained in the next clause. The meaning seems to be - We all partake of the loaf, and thereby become qualitatively, as it were, a part of it, as it of us, even as we all become members of Christ's one body, which that loaf sacramentally represents Some commentators, disliking the harshness of the expression, render it, "Because there is one bread, we being many are one body;" or, "For there is one bread. We being many are one body." But the language and context support the rendering of our version; and the supposed "physiology" is not so modern as to be at all surprising. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>For (&#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>Better, seeing that. It begins a new sentence which is dependent on the following proposition: Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one body. Paul is deducing the mutual communion of believers from the fact of their communion with their common Lord. By each and all receiving a piece of the one loaf, which represents Christ's body, they signify that they are all bound in one spiritual body, united to Christ and therefore to each other. So Rev., in margin. Ignatius says: "Take care to keep one eucharistic feast only; for there is one flesh of our Lord Jesus Christ, and one cup unto unity of His blood;" i.e., that all may be one by partaking of His blood (Philadelphia, 4).<p>Body<p>Passing from the literal sense, the Lord's body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>), to the figurative sense, the body of believers, the Church.<p>Partake of (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>Or partake from. That which all eat is taken from (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;) the one loaf, and they eat of it mutually, in common, sharing it among them (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;). So Ignatius: "That ye come together &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; breaking one loaf" (Ephesians, 20). </body></html>
