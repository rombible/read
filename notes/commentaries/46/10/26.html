It was merely when regarded as an actual sacrifice that any meat could be considered that “of devils.” This great truth, recognised in the Old Testament as well as in the New, is the reason of the previous statement that conscience need not come into the matter at all.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:23-33 There were cases wherein Christians might eat what had been offered to idols, without sin. Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the earth is the Lord's - This is quoted from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm">Psalm 24:1</a>. The same sentiment is also found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-11.htm">Psalm 50:11</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-14.htm">Deuteronomy 10:14</a>. It is here urged as a reason why it; is right to partake of the meat offered in the market. It all belongs to the Lord. It does not really belong to the idol, even though it has been offered to it. It may, therefore, be partaken of as his gift, and should be received with gratitude.<p>And the fulness thereof - All that the earth produces belongs to Him. He causes if to grow; and He has given it to be food for man; and though it may have been devoted to an idol, yet its nature is not changed. It is still the gift of God; still the production of His hand; still the fruit of His goodness and love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. The ground on which such eating without questioning is justified is, the earth and all its contents ("the fulness thereof," Ps 20:1; 50:12), including all meats, belong to the Lord, and are appointed for our use; and where conscience suggests no scruple, all are to be eaten (Ro 14:14, 20; 1Ti 4:4, 5; compare Ac 10:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This sentence is taken out of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm" title="The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.">Psalm 24:1</a></span>. The earth is God’s, or the Lord Christ’s, who hath sanctified all things for the use of man, and all the variety of creatures that are in it are sanctified by him. An idol cannot pollute any kind of meat, it hath no such malign influence upon any thing; you may pollute yourselves by your action, eating it in the idol’s temple, at an idolater’s feast immediately upon his sacrifice, but the idol itself is no operative thing, nor can cause an ill quality in the meat; let the meat be once returned to its common use, (the idolater’s sacred mysteries being over), it is the Lord’s, what he hath appointed for the use of man. In the idol’s temple they took the meat out of the devil’s hand, that was indeed unlawful; but if it were once returned to its common use, and sold in the market, they took it out of the hand of God’s common providence, and <span class="ital">every creature of God is good, and nothing to be</span> <span class="ital">refused, if it be received with thanksgiving, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof,....

If the earth and its fulness belong to God, how should it be necessary before using somewhat of them for food to institute an investigation on grounds of conscience, as if such gifts of God could be in themselves unholy, or involve sin in the use of them?

It is not the eating of meats that is sinful. ‘An idol is nothing in the world,’ and all creatures are made by God, and are therefore fit for food. (Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1 Timothy 4:4</a>.) But knowingly to countenance idolatrous rites, to give to another the glory due to the one True God alone, is a grievous sin. Therefore the whole question of sinfulness depends, not on the meat, but on the knowledge of him who eats it, what kind of meat it is. If he does not know that it has been offered to an idol, he may dismiss all scruples, for it is only this knowledge, and not the perishable meat (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>), which makes him partaker of the ‘table of devils.’ So <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-27.htm" title="If any of them that believe not bid you to a feast, and you be disposed to go; whatever is set before you, eat, asking no question for conscience sake.">1 Corinthians 10:27</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm" title="For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.">1 Corinthians 10:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦ Κυρίου</span>, <span class="ital">of the Lord</span>) not <span class="ital">of idols</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/24-1.htm" title="The earth is the LORD's, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.">Psalm 24:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρίου ἡ γῆ καὶ τὸ πλήρωμα αὐτῆς</span>—<span class="ital">The earth is the Lord’s and the fulness thereof</span>.
