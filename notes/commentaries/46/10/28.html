Such as when the flesh was sold in the market as common food, for the priest to whom it had been given. But a Christian must not merely consider what is lawful, but what is expedient, and to edify others. Christianity by no means forbids the common offices of kindness, or allows uncourteous behaviour to any, however they may differ from us in religious sentiments or practices. But this is not to be understood of religious festivals, partaking in idolatrous worship. According to this advice of the apostle, Christians should take care not to use their liberty to the hurt of others, or to their own reproach. In eating and drinking, and in all we do, we should aim at the glory of God, at pleasing and honouring him. This is the great end of all religion, and directs us where express rules are wanting. A holy, peaceable, and benevolent spirit, will disarm the greatest enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if any man - If any fellow guest; any scrupulous fellow Christian who may be present. That the word "any" (&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  tis) refers to a fellow guest seems evident; for it is not probable that the host would point out any part of the food on his own table, of the lawfulness of eating which he would suppose there was any doubt.

These words are missing in many mss. (see Mill's Greek Testament), and in the Vulgate, Syriac, Coptic, and Arabic versions; and are omitted by Griesbach. Grotius says that they should be omitted. There might easily have been a mistake in transcribing them from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm">1 Corinthians 10:26</a>. The authority of the mss., however, is in favor of retaining them; and they are quoted by the Greek fathers and commentators. If they are to be retained, they are to be interpreted, probably, in this sense; "There is no "necessity" that you should partake of this food. All things belong to God; and he has made ample provision for your needs without subjecting you to the necessity of eating this. Since this is the case, it is best to regard the scruples of those who have doubts of the propriety of eating this food, and to abstain." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. if any man&#8212;a weak Christian at table, wishing to warn his brother.<p>offered in sacrifice unto idols&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit "unto idols."

The information, “This is sacrificial meat,” might be volunteered to the Christian purchaser in the market (by the salesman, or a by-stander), or to the Christian guest at the unbeliever’s table (by the host, or by a fellow-guest), the communication being prompted by civility and the wish to spare the supposed susceptibilities of the Christian, or by the desire to embarrass him; whatever its occasion or motive, it alters the situation. The genuine reading, <span class="greekheb">ἱερόθυτον</span> (<span class="ital">slain-as-sacred</span>, i.e., <span class="ital">in sacrifice</span>), takes the statement as from the mouth of unbelievers; a Jew or Christian would presumably say <span class="greekheb">εἰδωλόθυτον</span>, as above and here in T.R.: Reuss and 1. suppose the informant to be “a Christian converted from heathenism” using the inoffensive term “at the table of a heathen host”; but <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπίστων</span> suggests <span class="ital">heathen</span> company, and <span class="greekheb">μηνύσαντα</span> <span class="ital">private</span> information. “Forbear eating (<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐσθίετε</span>, revoking the permission of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-25.htm" title="Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:">1 Corinthians 10:25</a> ff.) for the sake of him that informed (you), and for conscience’ sake.”—<span class="greekheb">Μηνύω</span> (see parls.), <span class="ital">to disclose</span> what does not appear on the surface or is imparted secretly.

He only repudiates the idle superstition that the food became <span class="accented">inherently tainted</span> by such a consecration when the eater was unaware of it. In later times, when the eating of such offerings was deliberately erected into a test of apostasy, he would have used language as strong against every semblance of compliance as any which was used by St. John himself or by Justin Martyr.
