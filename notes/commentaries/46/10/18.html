This is another argument against partaking of the heathen feasts. You cannot do so without connection with the heathen altar.

And is not this an act of communion with that God to whom such sacrifices are offered? And is not the case the same with those who eat of the sacrifices offered to idols? This argument, drawn from the sentiments of the Jews, was used with peculiar propriety, especially in reasoning with the false teachers at Corinth, who, it seems, were Jews, and who, to ingratiate themselves with the Corinthians, are supposed to have encouraged them to eat of the idol’s sacrifices.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold Israel - Look at the Jews. The design here is to illustrate the sentiment which he was establishing, by a reference to the fact that among the Jews those who partook of the same sacrifices were regarded as being one people, and as worshipping one God. So, if they partook of the sacrifices offered to idols, they would be regarded also as being fellow-worshippers of idols with them.<p>After the flesh - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm">Romans 4:1</a>. The phrase "after the flesh" is designed to denote the Jews who were not converted to Christianity; the natural descendants of Israel, or Jacob.<p>Are not they which eat of the sacrifices - A portion of the sacrifices offered to God was eaten by the offerer, and another portion by the priests. Some portions of the animal, as the fat, were burnt; and the remainder, unless it was a holocaust, or whole burnt-offering, was then the property of the priests who had officiated, or of the persons who had brought it; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-13.htm">Exodus 29:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-22.htm">Exodus 29:22</a>; Lev, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-4.htm">Leviticus 3:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-10.htm">Leviticus 3:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/3-15.htm">Leviticus 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-9.htm">Leviticus 4:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-3.htm">Leviticus 7:3-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-26.htm">Leviticus 8:26</a>.

They are united in their worship, and are so regarded. And in like manner, if you partake of the sacrifices offered to idols, and join with their worshippers in their temples, you will be justly regarded as "united" with them in their worship, and partaking with them in their abominations. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18.

So the apostle calls them, to distinguish them from the Israel of God, the spiritual Israel, whether Jews or Gentiles; who are born again, believe in the true Messiah, worship God in a spiritual manner, rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in fleshly things; but these were the descendants of Jacob or Israel by carnal generation, were carnal men, in the flesh, in a state of unregeneracy, and were employed in a carnal worship, in the observance of carnal commandments and ordinances; these the apostle directs to, to see, consider, and take notice of what they were doing; from whence some instruction might be taken, for the further clearing of the present point: <p>are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar? yes, they are. The priests and Levites who waited at the altar, and ministered about holy things there, who brought the sacrifices and laid them upon the altar of the burnt offerings, where the altar consumed and devoured one part by fire, and that which was left they ate among themselves; and so as they had communion with one another in eating, they partook of the altar, of the things, or sacrifices of the altar, and showed themselves to be of the Jewish religion, and professed and declared that they worshipped the God of Israel, and would be thought to have communion with him in so doing; in like manner, such who eat of things sacrificed to idols, declared themselves to be idolaters, to be of the Pagan religion, to be worshippers of idols, and to have fellowship with them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold Israel after the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> partakers of the altar?</span><p>(p) That is, those who yet observe their ceremonies.<p>(q) Are consenting and guilty, both of that worship and sacrifice.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>. <span class="ital">Another</span>[1681] analogue to prove that participation in the sacrificial feasts is idolatry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span>] without the link of the article, because <span class="greekheb">Ἰσρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σάρκα</span> is regarded as a single idea.

The Israelite who refused to eat of the flesh of the sacrifice as such, would thereby practically declare that he had nothing to do with the altar, but stood aloof from the sphere of theocratic connection with it. The man, on the other hand, who ate a portion of the flesh offered upon the altar, gave proof of the religious relation in which he stood to the altar itself. The question which may be asked, <span class="ital">Why did not Paul write</span> <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> <span class="ital">instead of</span> <span class="greekheb">θυσιαστ</span>.? is not to be answered by affirming that he could not ascribe the <span class="greekheb">κοιν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦ Θεοῦ εἰσί</span> to the <span class="greekheb">Ἰσρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σάρκα</span> (Rückert, <span class="ital">Abendm.</span> p. 217, and Neander; but could he not in truth, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-4.htm" title="Who are Israelites; to whom pertains the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the law, and the service of God, and the promises;">Romans 9:4</a> f., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>, say this of the people of God?), or by asserting that he could not well have attributed so high an effect to the sacrificial service (de Wette; but why should he not, seeing he does not specify any particular <span class="ital">kind</span> of fellowship with God?). But the true reply is this: the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία Θεοῦ</span> would have been here much too vague and remote a conception; for that fellowship belonged to the Jew already in his national capacity as one of the people of God generally, even apart from partaking of the sacrifices.

The word here translated <span class="ital">partakers</span> is not the same as in the last verse. It is, like the word translated <span class="ital">communion</span>, from <span class="greekheb">κοινὸς</span>, common, and implies that the altar and the worshipper share together in the victim. Bengel remarks that “he to whom anything is offered, the things which are offered, the altar on which they are offered,” and he might have added those who offer them, “have communion with each other.” If, therefore, any one knowingly rakes of an idol sacrifice, <span class="ital">as such</span> (it would seem that some went so as to contend that Christians might do so), he makes himself responsible for the worship of the idol, and all the evils with which that worship is connected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τοῦ θυσιαστηρίου</span>, <span class="ital">of the altar</span>) and therefore, <span class="ital">of God</span>. He, to whom the offering is made, those things which are offered, the altar on which they are offered, have communion [a mutual tie in common], as is evident from the following verses, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-20.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, swears by it, and by all things thereon....">Matthew 23:20-21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/10.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Partakers of the altar.</span> It is better to render it "Have they not <span class="accented">communion with the altar?"</span> for the word is different from that in the last verse.

The Israelite who partook of the sacrifices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-31.htm">Leviticus 8:31</a>) united himself with the altar of God. Paul says with the altar rather than with God, in order to emphasize the communion through the specific act of worship or sacrifice; since, in a larger sense, Israel after the flesh, Israel regarded as a nation, was, in virtue of that fact, in fellowship with God, apart from his partaking of the sacrifices. Possibly, also, to suggest the external character of the Jewish worship in contrast with the spiritual worship of Christians.
