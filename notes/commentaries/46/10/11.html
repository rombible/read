The Apostle does not state that the purpose which God had in view in allowing these sins and judgments was that they might serve “for ensamples” for after-generations, as may at first sight seem to be the meaning of the English, but the real point of the passage is—These things which occurred to them are to be looked upon by us, not merely as interesting historical events, but as having a typical significance. Their record remains as a standing warning that great privileges may be enjoyed by many, and used by them to their destruction. The temporal blessings of the Jewish nation foreshadow the greater spiritual blessings of the Christian Church.<p><span class= "bld">The ends of the world.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">the ends of the ages</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm" title="The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.">Matthew 13:39</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come....">1 Corinthians 10:11-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now all these things </span>— These various calamitous events; <span class="ital">happened unto them for ensamples </span>— That we might learn wisdom at their expense, and not trust to external privileges, while we go on in a course of disobedience to the divine authority. The apostle’s meaning is, that punishment inflicted on sinners in a public and extraordinary manner, makes them examples of the divine vengeance to their own generation, and to all succeeding ones which have any knowledge of their history. <span class="ital">And they are written for our admonition </span>— To warn us Christians; <span class="ital">upon whom the ends of the world — </span>Or, <span class="ital">of the ages; </span><span class="greekheb">των αιωνων</span>, <span class="ital">are come </span>— That is, at the end of the Mosaic dispensation, whose duration was measured by ages or jubilees. Or it may signify the last dispensation of religion, namely, that of the gospel, which succeeded the patriarchal and the Jewish. The expression has great force. All things meet together and come to a crisis under the last, the gospel dispensation; both benefits and dangers, punishments and rewards. And under it Christ will come as an avenger and a judge. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— As if he had said, Seeing that so many who enjoyed great spiritual privileges, yet were punished for their sins, therefore <span class="ital">let him that thinketh he standeth </span>— Or rather, that most assuredly standeth, (for the word <span class="greekheb">δοκει</span>, rendered <span class="ital">thinketh, </span>most certainly strengthens, rather than weakens the sense,) or is confident that he is able to resist temptation, and to continue steadfast in the practice of his duty; and that, thereupon, he shall be secure from punishment; <span class="ital">take heed lest he fall </span>— Into sin and perdition. <span class="ital">There hath no temptation </span>— <span class="greekheb">Πειρασμος</span>, <span class="ital">trial, </span>of any kind, whether by way of suffering, as the word means, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;">James 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1 Peter 1:6</a>; and in many other places; or of inducement to sin, as the expression signifies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:...">James 1:13-14</a>; <span class="ital">but such as is common to man — </span>Usual and ordinary among men: or, as the Greek word more especially imports, <span class="ital">proportioned to human strength. </span>At the time the apostle wrote this, the Christians at Corinth had not been much persecuted; see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1 Corinthians 4:8</a>. <span class="ital">But </span>— Or <span class="ital">and; God is faithful </span>— To his promise, and therefore <span class="ital">will not suffer</span> <span class="ital">you to be tempted </span>— Or <span class="ital">tried; above that ye are able </span>— Through the strength which he imparts, to endure the trial, and stand in the evil day; <span class="ital">but will, with the temptation </span>— By which he suffers you to be assaulted; <span class="ital">make a way to escape </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">την εκβασιν</span>, <span class="ital">a passage out </span>— That is, will provide for your deliverance; <span class="ital">that </span>— If you be not wanting to yourselves; <span class="ital">you may be able to bear it </span>— Yea, and may acquire new strength by, and comfort from the combat.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:6-14 Carnal desires gain strength by indulgence, therefore should be checked in their first rise. Let us fear the sins of Israel, if we would shun their plagues. And it is but just to fear, that such as tempt Christ, will be left by him in the power of the old serpent. Murmuring against God's disposals and commands, greatly provokes him. Nothing in Scripture is written in vain; and it is our wisdom and duty to learn from it. Others have fallen, and so may we. The Christian's security against sin is distrust of himself. God has not promised to keep us from falling, if we do not look to ourselves. To this word of caution, a word of comfort is added. Others have the like burdens, and the like temptations: what they bear up under, and break through, we may also. God is wise as well as faithful, and will make our burdens according to our strength. He knows what we can bear. He will make a way to escape; he will deliver either from the trial itself, or at least the mischief of it. We have full encouragement to flee from sin, and to be faithful to God. We cannot fall by temptation, if we cleave fast to him. Whether the world smiles or frowns, it is an enemy; but believers shall be strengthened to overcome it, with all its terrors and enticements. The fear of the Lord, put into their hearts, will be the great means of safety.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ensamples - Greek: "types" (&#x3c4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  tupoi). The same word which is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>. This verse is a repetition of the admonition contained in that verse, in order to impress it more deeply on the memory; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm">1 Corinthians 10:6</a>. The sense is, not that these things took place simply and solely to be examples, or admonitions, but that their occurrence illustrated great principles of human nature and of the divine government; they showed the weakness of men, and their liability to fall into sin, and their need of the divine protection, and they might thus be used for the admonition of succeeding generations.<p>They are written for our admonition - They are recorded in the writings of Moses, in order that we and all others might be admonished not to confide in our own strength. The admonition did not pertain merely to the Corinthians, but had an equal applicability to Christians in all ages of the world.<p>Upon whom the ends of the world are come - This expression is equivalent to that which so often occurs in the Scriptures, as, "the last time," "the latter day," etc.; see it fully explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17</a>. It means the last dispensation; or, that period and mode of the divine administration under which the affairs of the world would be wound up. There would be no mode of administration beyond that of the gospel. But it by no means denotes necessarily that the continuance of this period called "the last times," and "the ends of the world" would be brief, or that the apostle believed that the world would soon come to an end. It might be the last period, and yet be longer than any one previous period, or than all the previous periods put together. There may be a last dynasty in an empire, and yet it may be longer than any previous dynasty, or than all the previous dynasties put together. The apostle Paul was at special pains in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2</a> to show, that by affirming that the last time had come, he did not mean that the world would soon come to an end. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

The oldest manuscripts read, "by way of example."<p>the ends of the world&#8212;literally, "of the ages"; the New Testament dispensation in its successive phases (plural, "ends") being the winding up of all former "ages." No new dispensation shall appear till Christ comes as Avenger and Judge; till then the "ends," being many, include various successive periods (compare Heb 9:26). As we live in the last dispensation, which is the consummation of all that went before, our responsibilities are the greater; and the greater is the guilt, Paul implies, to the Corinthians, which they incur if they fall short of their privileges.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now all these things happened to them for ensamples; </span> all these dispensations of Divine providence in the revelations of Divine wrath against several sorts of sinners, happened to the Jews, who were God’s first and ancient people, and enjoyed those great privileges which were before mentioned, not only as just punishments upon them for their sins, but as examples or types, to let the succeeding world know what they should find God towards such kind of sinners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And they are written for our admonition; </span> and God in his wise providence hath ordered the record of them in holy writ, that others who should live afterward might read, and hear, and fear, and take warning, and beware of such wicked actions, as pulled down such vengeance upon a people, than which none can plead a nearer relation to God, or the receiving of greater favours and privileges from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon whom the ends of the world are come:</span> the apostles ordinarily in their epistles speak of the world as nigh to an end in their age, though it hath since continued more than sixteen hundred years; which would incline one to think, that they thought it would have been at an end before this time, but had no such revelation from God.
