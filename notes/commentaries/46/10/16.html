The order in which they are placed here has been variously accounted for, as arising either (Stanley) from the analogy to the heathen feasts, in which the libation came before the food, or (Meyer) because the Apostle intends to dwell at greater length upon the bread. The use of the plural “we,” in reference to both the blessing of the cup and the breaking of the bread, clearly indicates that it was in virtue of his representing the entire company present, and not as individually possessed of some miraculous gift, that the one who presided at a Communion performed the act of consecration.

Dr. Macknight renders the original expression, <span class="greekheb">ο ευλογουμεν</span>, <span class="ital">for which we bless God, </span>a sense which he thinks is sanctioned by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>, “where this blessing is interpreted by <span class="ital">the giving of thanks. </span>And he considers it as denoting the whole communicants’ joining together in blessing God over the cup, for his mercy in redeeming the world through the blood of Christ. Thus both Luke and Paul, in their account of the institution, express this part of the action by <span class="greekheb">ευχαριστησας</span>, <span class="ital">having given thanks. </span>And hence the service itself hath long borne the name of <span class="ital">the eucharist, </span>or thanksgiving, by way of eminence.” <span class="ital">Is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? </span>— The means of our partaking of those invaluable benefits which are the purchase of the blood of Christ? <span class="ital">The bread which we break — </span>And which was appointed in the first institution of the ordinance for this purpose; <span class="ital">is it not the communion of the body of Christ? </span>— In the like sense? That is, the means and token of our sharing in the privileges which he procured by the offering up of his body for us, to be torn, broken, and put to death. <span class="ital">For we, being many, are </span>yet, as it were, <span class="ital">one bread — One loaf, </span>as the word <span class="greekheb">αρτος </span>often signifies, and is translated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-9.htm" title="Do you not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?">Matthew 16:9</a>; where Jesus asks, <span class="ital">Do ye not remember the five </span><span class="greekheb">αρτους</span>, <span class="ital">loaves, of the five thousand? </span>and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm" title="And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.">Matthew 4:3</a>, <span class="ital">Command that these stones be made, </span><span class="greekheb">αρτους</span>, <span class="ital">loaves. </span>The sense is, It is this communion which makes us all one: by partaking of one and the same bread, we are united and formed into one mystical body. “This account of the Lord’s supper, the apostle gave to show the Corinthians, that as by eating thereof, the partakers declare they have the same object of worship, the same faith, the same hope, and the same dispositions with the persons whom they join in that act of religion, and that they will follow the same course of life; so, in all reasonable construction, by eating the sacrifices of idols, the partakers declare they are of the same faith and practice with the worshippers of idols, that they have the same objects of worship with them, and that they expect to share with them in the benefits to be derived from that worship.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:15-22 Did not the joining in the Lord's supper show a profession of faith in Christ crucified, and of adoring gratitude to him for his salvation ? Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cup of blessing which we bless - The design of this verse and the following verses seems to be, to prove that Christians, by partaking of the Lord's Supper, are solemnly set apart to the service of the Lord Jesus; that they acknowledge Him as their Lord, and dedicate themselves to him, and that as they could not and ought not to be devoted to idols and to the Lord Jesus at the same time, so they ought not to participate in the feasts in honor of idols, or in the celebrations in which idolaters would be engaged; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-21.htm">1 Corinthians 10:21</a>. He states, therefore:<p>(1) That Christians are "united" and dedicated to Christ in the communion; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16-17</a>.<p>(2) that this was true of the Israelites, that they were one people, devoted by the service of the altar to the same God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>.<p>(3) that though an idol was nothing, yet the pagan actually sacrificed to devils, and Christians ought not to partake with them; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm">1 Corinthians 10:19-21</a>. The phrase "cup of blessing" evidently refers to the wine used in the celebration of the Lord's Supper. it is called "the cup of blessing" because over it Christians praise or bless God for his mercy in providing redemption. It is not because it is the means of conveying a blessing to the souls of those who partake of it - though that is true - but because thanksgiving, blessing, and praise were rendered to God in the celebration, for the benefits of redemption; see Note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm">Matthew 26:26</a>. Or it may mean, in accordance with a well known Hebraism, "the blessed cup;" the cup that is blessed. This is the more literal interpretation; and it is adopted by Calvin, Beza, Doddridge, and others.<p>Which we bless - Grotius, Macknight, Vatablus, Bloomfield, and many of the early church fathers suppose that this means, "over which we bless God;" or, "for which we bless God." But this is to do violence to the passage. The more obvious signification is, that there is a sense in which it may be said that the cup is blessed, and that by prayer and praise it is set apart and rendered in some sense sacred to the purposes of religion. it cannot mean that the cup has undergone any physical change, or that the wine is anything but wine; but that it has been solemnly set apart to the service of religion, and by prayer and praise designated to be used for the purpose of commemorating the Saviour's love. That may be said to be blessed which is set apart to a sacred use (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-3.htm">Genesis 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-11.htm">Exodus 20:11</a>); and in this sense the cup may be said to be blessed; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-16.htm">Luke 9:16</a>, "And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven he blessed them," etc.; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-9.htm">Genesis 14:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-23.htm">Genesis 27:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/27-33.htm">Genesis 27:33</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-41.htm">Genesis 27:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-1.htm">Genesis 28:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-22.htm">Leviticus 9:22-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-18.htm">2 Samuel 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-41.htm">1 Kings 8:41</a>.<p>Is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? - Is it not the emblem by which the blood of Christ is exhibited, and the means by which our union through that blood is exhibited? Is it not the means by which we express our attachment to him as Christians; showing our union to him and to each other; and showing that we partake in common of the benefits of his blood? The main idea is, that by partaking of this cup they showed that they were united to him and to each other; and that they should regard themselves as set apart to him. We have communion with one &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  koino&#772;nia,) that which is in "common," that which pertains to all, that which evinces fellowship) when we partake together; when all have an equal right, and all share alike; when the same benefits or the same obligations are extended to all. And the sense here is, that Christians "partake alike" in the benefits of the blood of Christ; they share the same blessings; and they express this together, and in common, when they partake of the communion.<p>The bread ... - In the communion. It shows, since we all partake of it. that we share alike in the benefits which are imparted by means of the body of the Redeemer. In like manner it is implied that if Christians should partake with idolaters in the feasts offered in honor of idols, that they would be regarded as partaking with them in the services of idols, or as united to them, and therefore such participation was improper. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. The cup of blessing&#8212;answering to the Jewish "cup of blessing," over which thanks were offered in the Passover. It was in doing so that Christ instituted this part of the Lord's Supper (Mt 26:27; Lu 22:17, 20).<p>we bless&#8212;"we," not merely ministers, but also the congregation. The minister "blesses" (that is, consecrates with blessing) the cup, not by any priestly transmitted authority of his own, but as representative of the congregation, who virtually through him bless the cup. The consecration is the corporate act of the whole Church. The act of joint blessing by him and them (not "the cup" itself, which, as also "the bread," in the Greek is in the accusative), and the consequent drinking of it together, constitute the communion, that is, the joint participation "of the blood of Christ." Compare 1Co 10:18, "They who eat &#8230; are partakers" (joint communicants). "Is" in both cases in this verse is literal, not represents. He who with faith partakes of the cup and the bread, partakes really but spiritually of the blood and body of Christ (Eph 5:30, 32), and of the benefits of His sacrifice on the cross (compare 1Co 10:18). In contrast to this is to have "fellowship with devils" (1Co 10:20). Alford explains, "The cup &#8230; is the [joint] participation (that is, that whereby the act of participation takes place) of the blood," &c. It is the seal of our living union with, and a means of our partaking of, Christ as our Saviour (Joh 6:53-57). It is not said, "The cup &#8230; is the blood," or "the bread &#8230; is the body," but "is the communion [joint-participation] of the blood &#8230; body." If the bread be changed into the literal body of Christ, where is the sign of the sacrament? Romanists eat Christ "in remembrance of Himself." To drink literal blood would have been an abomination to Jews, which the first Christians were (Le 17:11, 12). Breaking the bread was part of the act of consecrating it, for thus was represented the crucifixion of Christ's body (1Co 11:24). The distinct specification of the bread and the wine disproves the Romish doctrine of concomitancy, and exclusion of the laity from the cup.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is on all hands agreed, that the apostle is here speaking of believers communicating in the sacrament of the Lord’s supper.

Meaning the cup of wine used in the Lord's supper, which being set apart for that service, is taken up, and the name of the Lord called upon over it; and he is blessed and praised for his wondrous love and grace, in the gift and mission of his Son, to shed his precious blood for us, for the remission of our sins; the whole church joining with the administrator, both in the act of blessing and praise over the cup, and in the participation of it. This cup is so called in allusion to the cup of wine used at common meals, or at the passover among the Jews, which they used to take and bless God with, and give him thanks for their mercies, and was commonly called  , "the cup of blessing" (c). <p>"Three things (says R. Judah (d)) shorten a man's days and years; when they give him the book of the law to read, and he does not read,   , "the cup of blessing to bless with", and he does not bless, and when he accustoms himself to government.'' <p>Again, so they comment on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-8.htm">Genesis 21:8</a> (e). <p>"what is the meaning "of the day that Isaac was weaned?" the holy blessed God will make a feast for the righteous, in the day that he weans the people of the seed of Isaac, and after they eat and drink, they give to Abraham    , "the cup of blessing to bless with"; he says to them, I will not bless, because Ishmael sprung from me; they give it to Isaac, he says to them, I am not fit to bless, for Esau came from me; they give it to Jacob, he says unto them I will not bless, for I married two sisters in their lifetime, which the law forbids me; they say to Moses, take it and bless, he says to them I will not bless, for I was not worthy to enter into the land of Israel, neither in life nor in death; they say to Joshua, take it and bless, he says I cannot bless, for I am not worthy of a son, as it is written, Nun his son, Joshua his son; they say to David, take thou it and bless, he saith unto them I will bless, and it is comely for me to bless; as it is said, "I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord".'' <p>Once more they ask (f), <p>"what is a beautiful cup?  , "the cup of blessing";'' <p>and which, they (g) observe, ought to hold the fourth part of a log of wine. These instances clearly show from whence the apostle borrowed this expression, and which he chooses to make use of because well known to the Jews, and as being very appropriate to the cup in the Lord's supper, he is speaking of: <p>is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? it is; that is, it is a sign, symbol, and token of fellowship with Christ in his death; it is a means of having communion with him, and of enjoying the blessings of grace which come through his blood; such as righteousness, peace, pardon, and atonement; all which true believers are made partakers of; and this part of the Lord's supper, the cup being drank of, is a testimony and an indication of the same: "the bread which we break"; which is the other part of the ordinance, which, though performed first, is mentioned last, because of the argument the apostle pursues upon it. The act of breaking the bread does not only design the distribution and eating of it, but the manner also in which it is prepared for distribution and eating, namely by breaking it into pieces; and which is aptly expressive of the body of Christ, which was wounded, bruised, and broken for us: <p>is it not the communion of the body of Christ? it is; for not only believers by this act have communion with his mystical body, the church, but with his natural body, which was broken for them they in a spiritual sense and by faith eat his flesh, as well as drink his blood, and partake of him, of his sufferings and death, endured in his body, and of all the blessings of grace consequent thereon. The apostle's view in this instance, and his argument upon it, is this, that if believers, by eating the bread and drinking the wine in the Lord's supper, spiritually partake of Christ, of his body and of his blood, and have communion with him; then such who eat of things sacrificed unto idols, have in so doing communion with them, and partake of the table of devils, and so are guilty of idolatry, which he would have them avoid. <p>(c) T.

Here it must necessarily have the former sense (against Billroth), for the mere <span class="ital">significance</span> of a participation would go no way towards proving the proposition that eating meat offered to idols was idolatry; and as, therefore, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a> it is not the <span class="ital">significance</span>, but the <span class="ital">fact</span> of the participation, that is expressed (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>), so also must it of necessity be here. <span class="ital">What sort of a</span> participation it might be, was of no importance in the present connection, for the apostle is dealing here simply with the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> in itself, not with its nature, which differed according to the different analogies adduced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>). It cannot therefore be gathered from this passage whether he was thinking of some kind of <span class="ital">real</span>, possibly even <span class="ital">material</span> connection of those eating and drinking in the Supper with the body and blood of Christ,[1656] or, on the other hand, of an <span class="ital">inward</span> union realized <span class="ital">in the believing consciousness</span>, consisting therefore in the <span class="ital">spiritual contact</span> whereby the believer, who partakes of the elements, is conscious to himself in so partaking of being connected by saving appropriation with the body and blood of reconciliation. But we see clearly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:24</a> f. that Paul <span class="ital">could</span> only mean the latter, since at the institution of the Supper the body of Christ was not yet slain, and His blood still flowed in His veins.[1657] See, besides, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-26.htm" title="And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and broke it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.">Matthew 26:26</a>. Again, if the <span class="ital">glorified</span> state of His body, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς δόξης αὐτοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>), set in only with His ascension, and if, when He instituted the Supper, His body was still but the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα τῆς σαρκὸς αὐτοῦ</span>, which soon after died upon the cross for reconciliation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>), while, nevertheless, the first Lord’s Supper, dispensed by <span class="ital">Jesus Himself</span>, must have earned with it the whole specific <span class="ital">essence</span> of the sacred ordinance—that essence depending precisely upon the <span class="ital">future crucifixion</span> of the body and <span class="ital">outpouring</span> of the blood,—then the apostle cannot have in view the <span class="ital">glorified</span>[1658] <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἷμα</span> as being given and partaken of through the <span class="ital">medium</span> of the bread and wine. Otherwise, we should have to attribute to Paul the extravagant conception,—which is, however, equally out of harmony with the institution itself and without shadow of warrant in the apostle’s words, nay, at variance with what he says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-50.htm" title="Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.">1 Corinthians 15:50</a>,—that, at the last Supper, Jesus had His pneumatic body already at His disposal to dispense as He would (Olshausen, Hofmann), or that a momentary glorification, like that on the Mount, took place at the time of instituting the Supper, as Kahnis formerly held; but see now his <span class="ital">Dogmat.</span> I. p. 622; and comp also, on the other side, Ebrard, <span class="ital">Dogma vom heilig. Abendm.</span> I. p. 109 f. Either, therefore, the apostle regarded the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of Christ’s body and blood as being different before His glorification from what it was afterwards, or it was in his eyes, both before and after, the inward spiritual fellowship realized by the inner man through the medium of the symbol partaken of, as an appropriation of the work of atonement consummated through means of His body and blood, and consequently as a real life-fellowship, other than which, indeed, he could not conceive it as realized when the Supper was instituted. Comp Keim in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. für Deutsche Theol.</span> 1859, p. 90; Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> p. 355. Against this <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> subjectively realized in the devout feeling of the believer, and objectively established by the divine institution of the ordinance itself, it is objected that the phrase, “fellowship of the body and blood,” expresses at any rate an <span class="ital">interpenetration</span> of Christ’s body and the bread (according to the Lutheran synecdoche; comp Kahnis’ former view in his <span class="ital">Abendm.</span> p. 136, also Hofmann, p. 219). But this objection asserts too much, and therefore proves nothing, seeing that the fellowship with Christ’s body and blood realized by means of the <span class="ital">symbol</span> also corresponds to the notion of fellowship, and that all the more, because this eating and drinking of the elements <span class="ital">essentially</span> is <span class="ital">the specific medium</span> of the deep, inward, real, and living <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>; hence, too, the “calix communionis” cannot be possibly a <span class="ital">figurata loquutio</span>. This last point we maintain against Calvin, who, while insisting that “non tollatur <span class="ital">figurae veritas</span>,” and also that the thing itself is there, namely, that “non minus sanguinis communionem anima percipiat, quam ore vinum bibimus,” still explains away the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of the blood of Christ to the effect, “dum simul omnes nos in corpus suum inserit, ut vivat in nobis et nos in ipso.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὃν κλῶμεν</span>] There was no need to repeat here that the bread, too, was hallowed by a prayer of thanksgiving, after the <span class="ital">cup</span> had been already so carefully described as a cup consecrated <span class="ital">for the Supper</span>. Instead of doing so, Paul enriches his representation by mention of the other <span class="ital">essential symbolic action</span> with the bread; comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-24.htm" title="And when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, Take, eat: this is my body, which is broken for you: this do in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:24</a>. That the breaking of the bread, however, was <span class="ital">itself</span> the <span class="ital">consecration</span> (Rückert), the narrative of the institution will not allow us to assume.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ σώματος τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>.] in the strict, not in the figurative sense, as Stroth, Rosenmüller, Schulthess, and others: “declaramus nos esse membra corporis Christi, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> societatis Christianae,” comp also Baur, <span class="ital">neut. Theol.</span> p. 201. This interpretation is at variance with the first clause, for which the meaning of the Supper as first instituted forbids such a figurative explanation (in opposition to Zwingli[1664]); nor can this be justified by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-17.htm" title="For we being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread.">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>; for<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1646] <span class="ital">Who</span> had to officiate at this consecration? Every Christian man probably might do so at that time, when the arrangements of church-life as regards public worship were as yet so little reduced to fixed order. In Justin Martyr’s time (<span class="ital">Apol.</span> i. 65) it fell to the <span class="greekheb">προεστώς</span>, but so that the president is conceived as representing and acting in fellowship with the congregation. See Ritschl, <span class="ital">altkathol. K.</span> p. 365 f. The <span class="ital">plurals</span> in the passage before us are the utterance of the <span class="ital">Christian consciousness of fellowship</span>, to which it makes no difference who, in each separate ease, may be the ministerial <span class="ital">organ</span> of the fellowship. Kahnis explains them from the <span class="ital">amen</span> of the congregation (Justin, <span class="ital">loc. cit.</span>); but that itself was primarily the time-hallowed expression of that consciousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1647] With excessive arbitrariness Hofmann (comp. his <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> II. 2, p. 225 f.) insists on taking <span class="greekheb">εὐλογία</span> otherwise than <span class="greekheb">εὐλογοῦμεν</span>; the former, in the sense of an <span class="ital">ascription of praise</span>, with <span class="ital">God</span> as its subject: the latter, in the sense of <span class="ital">consecrating</span> the <span class="ital">cup</span>. The consecration, according to him, makes the difference between it and the Passover cup. But the said difference could not have been expressed by Paul in a more unsuitable or perplexing way than by repeating the same word.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1651] Hofmann too comes to this in substance after all, although he tries to escape from it, taking <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> as “<span class="ital">the matter of fact of a joint (?) participancy</span>,” and then opining that the apostle has in view an eating of the bread and drinking of the wine, which <span class="ital">by means of</span> this corporeal process, and without its being possible to eat and drink merely bread and wine, <span class="ital">makes us joint-partakers</span> of the body and blood of Christ. In support of the meaning thus assigned to <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, Hofmann appeals inappropriately to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="All the saints salute you.">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>. <span class="ital">Joint</span> participancy would be <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνία</span>; comp. <span class="greekheb">συγκοινωνός</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-23.htm" title="And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.">1 Corinthians 9:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-17.htm" title="And if some of the branches be broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in among them, and with them partake of the root and fatness of the olive tree;">Romans 11:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1653] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1654] It is plain from vv. 18, 20, 21, that <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is here neither <span class="ital">communication</span>, apportioning (Luther, <span class="ital">al.</span>, including Kling, Billroth), which it never means in the N. T. (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>), nor <span class="ital">consortium, societas</span> (Erasmus: “quod pariter sanguine Christi sumus redemti,” comp.

Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom.</span> I. p. 274; Kahnis, <span class="ital">Abendm.</span> p. 60 f.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1657] When Rodatz objects that an <span class="ital">ideal</span> union with the actual body slain and blood shed is a <span class="ital">logical contradiction</span>, he overlooks the fact that the material sphere is not beyond the reach of inward appropriation. Spiritual communion may have reference to a material object, without excluding a symbolic process in which “signatum non cum signo sed nobiscum unitur” (Vossius, <span class="ital">de baptismo</span>, p. 11). Comp. Kahnis, <span class="ital">Dogmat.</span> I. 621: “Bread and wine form not a mere symbol, but a <span class="ital">sign</span>, which is at the same time <span class="ital">medium</span>;” see also III. p. 489. The important alteration in the Latin <span class="ital">Confess. Aug.</span> Art. X. of 1540, points in the same direction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1658] Rückert also (<span class="ital">Abendm.</span> p. 224 ff.) holds that Paul conceived the body and blood in the Supper as <span class="ital">glorified</span>; that, in virtue of the consecration, the participant partakes of the glorified blood, etc. Rückert, of course, discards all questions as to mode in connection with this view which he ascribes to the apostle, but which he himself considers a baseless one (p. 242). His mistake lies in deducing too much from <span class="greekheb">πνευματικόν</span>, which is neither in ver. 3 nor anywhere else in the N. T. the opposite of <span class="ital">material</span>, but of <span class="ital">natural</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-5.htm" title="You also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.">1 Peter 2:5</a> not excluded); and the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> to which <span class="greekheb">πνευματικός</span> refers is always (except <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-13.htm" title="Why take to you the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand.">Ephesians 6:13</a>, where it is the <span class="ital">diabolic</span> spirit-world that is spoken of) the <span class="ital">Divine</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>. In the case of gifts which are <span class="greekheb">πνευματικά</span>, it is this <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> who is always the <span class="ital">agent</span>; so with the supply of manna and water in the wilderness, and so, too, with the bread and wine received in the Lord’s Supper, inasmuch as in this <span class="greekheb">βρῶμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">πόμα</span> the communion of the body and blood of Christ is realized, which does not take place when bread and wine are partaken of in the ordinary, natural way.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1664] Zwingli, in his <span class="ital">Respon. ad Bugenh.</span>, explains it thus: “Poculum gratiarum actionis, quo gratias agimus, quid quaeso, aliud est quam <span class="ital">nos ipsi</span>? Nos enim quid aliud sumus nisi ipsa communio, ipse coetus et populus, consortium et sodalitas sanguinis Christi? h. e. ille ipse populus, qui sanguine Christi ablutus est.” The most thorough historical development of Zwingli’s doctrine is that given by Dieckhoff in his <span class="ital">evang. Abendmahlslehre im Reformationszeitalter</span>, I. p. 428 ff. Rückert remarks with justice that Zwingli has here lost his footing on evangelical ground altogether. But Calvin, too, has lost it, inasmuch as he makes everything turn upon the spiritual reception of the <span class="ital">glorified</span> body, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> upon receiving the vivifying power which flows from it, whereas the words of institution have to do simply with that body, <span class="ital">which was to be crucified for the atonement</span> and with <span class="ital">its</span> fellowship.

Such a technical Hebraism would scarcely be obvious to the Cor[1496], and the gen[1497] so construed is artificial in point of Gr[1498] idiom; whereas the former construction is natural, and gives a sense in keeping with the readers’ experience.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ποτήριον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄρτον</span> are acc[1499] by <span class="ital">inverse relative attraction</span>, a constr[1500] not unknown, though rare, in cl[1501] Gr[1502] (see Wr[1503], p. 204). Hf[1504] thinks that, with the merging of these nouns in the rel[1505] clause, the <span class="ital">Acts of blessing</span> the cup and <span class="ital">breaking</span> the bread becomes the real subject of <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> in each instance—as though P. wrote, “when we bless the cup, break the bread, is it not a communion, etc.?” In any case, the “communion” looks beyond the bare <span class="greekheb">ποτήριον</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἄρτος</span> to the whole sacred action, the <span class="ital">usus poculi</span>, etc. (Bg[1506]), of which they form the centre. “The bread” is “blessed” equally with “the cup,” but in its case the prominent symbolic act is that of <span class="ital">breaking</span> (see parls.), which connotes the distribution to “many” of the “one loaf.” Thus “the sacramental bread came to be known as the <span class="greekheb">κλασμός</span>: so <span class="ital">Did</span>., § 9” (Ed[1507]).—On the pl[1508] <span class="greekheb">εὐλογοῦμεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κλῶμεν</span>, Mr[1509] observes: “<span class="ital">Whose</span> was it to officiate in this consecration?

First reason against taking part in an idol feast. We communicate together in the Body and Blood of Christ, and we are thereby debarred from communion with any beings alien to Him; a communion into which, by the analogy of all sacrificial rites, we enter with the beings to whom such sacrifices are offered. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>. The term <span class="ital">cup of blessing</span> is a Hebraism for the cup over which a blessing is to be pronounced, whose characteristic it is to be blessed. It was the name given to the cup over which thanks were given at the Passover. Lightfoot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which we bless</span>] Over which we pronounce the words of blessing and thanksgiving commanded by Christ. See St <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-20.htm" title="Likewise also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood, which is shed for you.">Luke 22:20</a> and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:25</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?</span>] “<span class="ital">Comynyng</span>,” Wiclif. See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm" title="Purge out therefore the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, as you are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us:">1 Corinthians 5:7</a>. “The word communion is stronger than partaking,” Chrysostom. The idea is that of a meal on a sacrificed victim, which is Christ Himself, the true Paschal Lamb, by feeding on Whom all who partake of Him are made sharers of His Flesh and Blood, and thus are bound together in the closest fellowship with Him. The fact of this Eucharistic feeding upon Christ is adduced as the strongest reason why Christians cannot lawfully take part in idolatrous rites. It is as impossible to <span class="ital">exclude</span> here the active sense of “communication” (see note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm" title="God is faithful, by whom you were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>), as it is to confine the word to that signification. It must be taken in the widest possible sense, as including Christ’s feeding His people with His Flesh and Blood, and their joint participation in the same.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The bread which we break</span>] Calvin here characteristically contends that the Eucharistic loaf was handed from one to the other, and that each broke off his share. But it is obvious that the words are such as could be used by any minister of the Christian Church, of the solemn breaking of the bread in obedience to Christ’s command. And it may be further observed that only Christ is said to have broken the bread at the first institution of the Eucharist. The Roman Catholic commentator, Estius, here, however, agrees with Calvin. The breaking of the bread, he says, was first performed “a presbyteris et diaconis,” and afterwards “a caeteris fidelibus.” The language of St Paul is not precise enough to enable us absolutely to decide the point.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the communion of the body of Christ</span>] Wiclif, <span class="ital">taking</span>; Tyndale, <span class="ital">partaking</span>. See note above on the communion of the Blood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

The interchange of the order here is a proof, that the body of Christ is received separately, not inasmuch as it has the blood accompanying it. In mentioning food more respect is paid to meat, than drink; but in the mystery of redemption the blood is oftener named, than the body of Christ. Hence Paul’s promiscuous arrangement [sometimes <span class="ital">the bread</span>, at other times <span class="ital">the wine</span> coming first].—<span class="greekheb">τὴς εὐλογίας</span>, <span class="ital">of blessing</span>) on that account it is distinguished from a common cup, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-27.htm" title="And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink you all of it;">Matthew 26:27</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ εὐλογοῦμεν</span>, <span class="ital">which we bless</span>) plural as in <span class="ital">we break</span>, supply, <span class="ital">we</span>, ministers and believers, each for his own part: comp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm" title="In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>.
