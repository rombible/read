Or is made either better or worse, or to differ from ordinary meat, by being thus offered to idols? You well know that I intend to maintain nothing of this kind: so far from it, that I aver <span class="ital">the things which the Gentiles sacrifice </span>— To supposed deities; they <span class="ital">sacrifice to devils </span>— For, though I grant the idol is nothing, yet those spirits that sometimes dwell in the images of these idols, and give answers from them, are something: they are <span class="ital">demons, </span>most wicked and unclean spirits, defiling every person and thing that has any relation to them. We may observe here, “The word <span class="greekheb">δαιμωνια</span>, <span class="ital">demons, </span>is used in the LXX. to denote the ghosts of men deceased; and Josephus (<span class="ital">Bell., </span>lib. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>) says, demons are the spirits of wicked men. It is therefore probable, that the writers of the New Testament use the word <span class="ital">demons </span>in the same sense, especially as it is well known that the greatest part of the heathen gods were dead men. The heathen worshipped two kinds of <span class="ital">demons: </span>the one kind were the souls of kings and heroes, deified after death, but who could have no agency in human affairs; the other kind of demons were those evil spirits who, under the names of Jupiter, Apollo, Trophonius, &c., moving the heathen priests and priestesses to deliver oracles, greatly promoted idolatry.” — Macknight. Such in reality, as if he had said, are the gods of the heathen, and with such only can ye hold communion in those sacrifices. <span class="ital">And not to God </span>— The heathen in general had no idea of <span class="ital">God; </span>that is, of an unoriginated, eternal, immutable, and infinitely perfect being, the Creator and Governor of all things. <span class="ital">And I would not ye should have fellowship with devils </span>— Or with their votaries, either in their worship, their principles, their practices, or their hopes; — ye who have at your baptism solemnly renounced the devil and all his adherents. For certainly it is not a small sin, nor a thing to be made light of, to have fellowship with them. <span class="ital">Ye cannot of right </span>— Or in reason, you ought not, it is contrary to your Christian profession so to do; <span class="ital">drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils </span>— Ye cannot have communion with both; cannot reasonably make profession of the worship of God, (which you do in the Lord’s supper in the highest instance,) and also of the worship of devils, (as you do in the idol feasts,) these being so contrary one to the other. <span class="ital">Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy </span>— Namely, by joining devils in competition with him? or by thus caressing his rivals? <span class="ital">Are we stronger than He? </span>— Able to resist or to bear his wrath?

Christians, by this ordinance, and the faith therein professed, were united as the grains of wheat in one loaf of bread, or as the members in the human body, seeing they were all united to Christ, and had fellowship with him and one another. This is confirmed from the Jewish worship and customs in sacrifice. The apostle applies this to feasting with idolaters. Eating food as part of a heathen sacrifice, was worshipping the idol to whom it was made, and having fellowship or communion with it; just as he who eats the Lord's supper, is accounted to partake in the Christian sacrifice, or as they who ate the Jewish sacrifices partook of what was offered on their altar. It was denying Christianity; for communion with Christ, and communion with devils, could never be had at once. If Christians venture into places, and join in sacrifices to the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, they will provoke God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What say I then? - This is in the present tense; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  ti oun phe&#772;mi, what do I say?

Does my reasoning lead to that conclusion; and am I to be understood as affirming that an idol is of itself of any consequence? It must be recollected that the Corinthian Christians are introduced by Paul <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm">1 Corinthians 8:4</a> as saying that they knew that an idol was nothing in the world. Paul did not directly contradict that; but his reasoning had led him to the necessity of calling the propriety of their attending on the feasts of idols in question; and he introduces the matter now by asking these questions, thus leading the mind to it rather than directly affirming it at once. "Am I in this reasoning to be understood as affirming that an idol is anything, or that the meat there offered differs from other meat? No; you know, says Paul, that this is not my meaning. I admit that an idol in itself is nothing; but I do not admit, therefore, that it is right for you to attend in their temples; for though the "idol" itself - the block of wood or stone - is nothing, yet the offerings are really made to devils; and I would not have you engage in such a service;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20-21</a>.<p>That the idol is anything? - That the block of wood or stone is a real living object of worship, to be dreaded or loved?

What say I then?&#8212;The inference might be drawn from the analogies of the Lord's Supper and Jewish sacrifices, that an idol is really what the heathen thought it to be, a god, and that in eating idol-meats they had fellowship with the god. This verse guards against such an inference: "What would I say then? that a thing sacrificed to an idol is any real thing (in the sense that the heathen regard it), or that an idol is any real thing?" (The oldest manuscripts read the words in this order. Supply "Nay") "But [I say] that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils (demons)." Paul here introduces a new fact. It is true that, as I said, an idol has no reality in the sense that the heathen regard it, but it has a reality in another sense; heathendom being under Satan's dominion as "prince of this world," he and his demons are in fact the powers worshipped by the heathen, whether they are or are not conscious of it (De 32:17; Le 17:7; 2Ch 11:15; Ps 106:37; Re 9:20). "Devil" is in the Greek restricted to Satan; "demons" is the term applied to his subordinate evil spirits. Fear, rather than love, is the motive of heathen worship (compare the English word "panic," from Pan, whose human form with horns and cloven hoofs gave rise to the vulgar representations of Satan which prevail now); just as fear is the spirit of Satan and his demons (Jas 2:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I do not by this contradict what I before said, nor now affirm that an idol is any thing, or the sacrifices offered to it any thing. An idol hath nothing in it of a Deity, nor can it either sanctify or pollute any thing that is set before it; the error is in your action, as you communicate with such as are idolaters; it is your own action that polluteth you, not the idol, nor yet the meat set before it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>What say I then?.... Or may be objected to, or inferred from, what I say; <p>that an idol is anything, or that which is sacrificed to idols is anything? to which must be answered, as the Syriac version reads,   "no", by no means; by running the parallel between Christians having communion with the body and blood of Christ, in the Lord's supper, through eating the bread and drinking the wine, the Israelites partaking of the altar, by eating of the sacrifices of it, and men's joining with idols and idolaters, by eating things sacrificed to idols; it follows not that an idol has anything of deity in it, and is to be set upon a level with God, when, as he had said before, an idol was nothing, and what he now said did not at all contradict that; or that things offered to idols are to be had in the same account, or to be equalled to, or be thought to have any thing in them, as the elements of the bread and wine in the Lord's supper, or the sacrifices that were offered by the Israelites on the altar, according to the divine command; he meant no such thing, but only argued from the greater to the lesser, and his sense is more fully declared in the next words. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?...">1 Corinthians 10:19-20</a>. By these two analogues, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?...">1 Corinthians 10:16-18</a>, the apostle has now justified his warning given above against the sacrificial feasts as a warning against idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-14.htm" title="Why, my dearly beloved, flee from idolatry.">1 Corinthians 10:14</a>). But from the case of the Jewish sacrificial eating last adduced, his readers might easily draw the inference: “You declare, then, the idolatrous offerings and the idols to be what the heathen count them?” For whereas the apostle adduced the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of the Jewish <span class="greekheb">θυσιαστήριον</span>, and that as an analogue of the heathen <span class="greekheb">θυσιαστήρια</span>, he seemed thereby to recognise the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of these too, and consequently also the real divine existence of the idols thus adored. He therefore himself puts the possible false inference in the shape of a question (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>), and then annuls it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm" title="But I say, that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils, and not to God: and I would not that you should have fellowship with devils.">1 Corinthians 10:20</a> by adducing the wholly different results to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-18.htm" title="Behold Israel after the flesh: are not they which eat of the sacrifices partakers of the altar?">1 Corinthians 10:18</a> in reality gives rise.

To accent the words <span class="greekheb">τι ἔστιν</span> (Billroth, Tischendorf, comp Ewald) would give the sense: <span class="ital">that any idol-sacrifice</span> (and: <span class="ital">any idol</span>) <span class="ital">exists</span>, in the capacity, that is to say, <span class="ital">of idol-sacrifice</span> and <span class="ital">of idol</span>. Either rendering harmonizes with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>. In opposition to the latter of the two, it must not be said, with Rückert, that <span class="greekheb">ἔστι</span> would need to come immediately after <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, for the last place, too, is the seat of emphasis (Kühner, II. p. 625); nor yet, with de Wette, that the one half (<span class="greekheb">εἰδωλόθυτον</span>) is not so suitable, for the context surely makes it perfectly plain that Paul is not speaking of <span class="ital">absolute</span> existence. But since both renderings are equally good as regards sense and expression, we can only decide between them on this ground, that with the second the <span class="greekheb">τί</span> would be superfluous, whereas with the first—which, following the Vulgate, is the common one—it has significance, which should give it the preference. At the same time, we must not insert any pregnancy of meaning like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-7.htm" title="So then neither is he that plants any thing, neither he that waters; but God that gives the increase.">1 Corinthians 3:7</a> (<span class="ital">of influence and effect</span>) into the <span class="greekheb">τί</span>, as Hofmann does without warrant from the context; but it is the simple <span class="ital">aliquid</span>, the opposite of the non-real, of the <span class="ital">non-ens</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ</span>] refers to the negative sense of the preceding question.

T.,[1688] and would, moreover, yield a thought quite out of keeping with the context; for it was the apostle’s aim to point to a connection with an antichristian <span class="ital">reality</span>. The word means, as always in the N. T., <span class="ital">demons, diabolic spirits</span>. That the heathen worships <span class="ital">quoad eventum</span> (of course not <span class="ital">quoad intentionem</span>) were offered to devils, was a view derived by all the later Jews with strict logical consistency from the premisses of a pure monotheism and its opposite. See the LXX. rendering of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37</a>,—a reminiscence of which we have in Paul’s expression here,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-5.htm" title="The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry land.">Psalm 95:5</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/4-7.htm" title="For ye provoked him that made you by sacrificing unto devils, and not to God.">Bar 4:7</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/3-8.htm" title="Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her.

So Paul, too, makes the real existences answering to the heathen conceptions of the gods, to be <span class="ital">demons</span>, which is essentially connected with the Christian idea that heathendom is the realm of the devil; for, according to this idea, the various individual beings regarded by the heathen as gods can be nothing else but diabolic spirits, who collectively make up the whole imperial host of the <span class="greekheb">ἄρχων τοῦ κόσμου τούτου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>), who is himself the <span class="greekheb">ἀρχηγός</span>.[1689] Comp Hahn, <span class="ital">Theol. des N.

Rückert therefore (with Grotius) is wrong in altering the representation to this effect, that according to Paul the demons had “<span class="ital">given the heathen to believe</span>” that there were gods to whom men should sacrifice, in order to obtain for themselves under their name divine worship and offerings, and that <span class="ital">in so far</span> the sacrifices of the heathen were presented to demons.

Paul admits the non-reality of the idol in itself; but he discerns other terrible presences behind the image—“demons” are virtually worshipped at the idol-feast, and with these the celebrants are brought into contact. “What then do I affirm (the <span class="greekheb">φημὶ</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1 Corinthians 10:15</a> resumed)? that an idol-sacrifice is anything (<span class="ital">has reality</span>)? or that an idol is anything? (to say this would be to contradict <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="As concerning therefore the eating of those things that are offered in sacrifice to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is none other God but one.">1 Corinthians 8:4</a>). No, but that (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ὅτι</span>) what the Gentiles sacrifice they sacrifice to <span class="ital">demons</span>, and not to God; and I would not that you should be communicants of the demons!” How could the Cor[1529], as “men of sense, judge” of a situation like this? The riot and debauch attending heathen festivals showed that foul spirits of evil presided over them: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-6.htm" title="Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.">1 Corinthians 10:6</a> ff., referring to the worship of Baal-Peor, with which the allusion here made to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm" title="They sacrificed to devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.">Deuteronomy 32:17</a> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/106-37.htm" title="Yes, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to devils,">Psalm 106:37</a> f.) is in keeping. “That the worship of heathen cults was offered <span class="ital">quoad eventum</span>—not indeed <span class="ital">quoad intentionem</span>—to devils was, consistently with their strict monotheism, the general view of later Jews” (Mr[1530]). Heathenism P. regarded as the domain of Satan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-6.htm" title="And the devil said to him, All this power will I give you, and the glory of them: for that is delivered to me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.">Luke 4:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm" title="And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lies in wickedness.">1 John 5:19</a>), under whose rule the demons serve as the angels under that of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm" title="Then shall he say also to them on the left hand, Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:">Matthew 25:41</a>, etc.); idolatry was, above everything, inspired by Satan. <span class="greekheb">δαιμόνιον</span> (= <span class="greekheb">δαίμων</span>, of which it is neut. adj[1531]) was primarily synon. with <span class="greekheb">θεῖον</span>—“<span class="greekheb">δαίμων</span> is related to <span class="greekheb">θεὸς</span> as <span class="ital">numen</span> to <span class="ital">persona divina</span>” (Cr[1532]); <span class="greekheb">τὸ δαιμόνιον οὐδέν ἐστιν ἀλλʼ ἢ θεὸς ἢ θεοῦ ἔργον</span> (Arist., <span class="ital">Rhet</span>., ii. 23. 8); hence Socrates called the mysterious guiding voice within him <span class="greekheb">δαιμόνιόν τι</span>. Ed[1533] observes a tendency, beginning with Eurip. and Plato and accentuated in the Stoics, “to use the word in a depreciatory sense”; already in Homer it often suggested the <span class="ital">uncanny</span>, the supernatural as an object of dread. The word was ready to hand for the LXX translators, who used it to render various Heb. epithets for heathen gods. Later Judaism, which peopled the unseen with good and evil spirits, made <span class="greekheb">δαιμόνια</span> a general term for the latter, apart from any specific refer. to idols (see, already, <a href="http://apocrypha.org/tobit/3-8.htm" title="Because that she had been married to seven husbands, whom Asmodeus the evil spirit had killed, before they had lain with her.
