The manna on which they fed was a type of Christ crucified, the Bread which came down from heaven, which whoso eateth shall live for ever. Christ is the Rock on which the Christian church is built; and of the streams that issue therefrom, all believers drink, and are refreshed.

The word meat here is used in the old English sense of the word, to denote "food" in general. They lived on "manna." The word "spiritual" here is evidently used to denote that which was given by the Spirit, or by God; that which was the result of his miraculous gift, and which was not produced in the ordinary way, and which was not the gross food on which people are usually supported. It had an excellency and value from the fact that it was the immediate gift of God, and is thus called "angels food." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a>. It is called by Josephus "divine and extraordinary food." Ant. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/3-1.htm">Psalm 3:1</a>. In the language of the Scriptures, that which is distinguished for excellence, which is the immediate gift of God, which is unlike that which is gross and of earthly origin, is called "spiritual," to denote its purity, value, and excellence. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-46.htm">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-3.htm">Ephesians 1:3</a>.

Paul plainly implies the importance which was attached to these two sacraments by all Christians in those days: "an inspired protest against those who lower their dignity, or deny their necessity" [Alford]. Still he guards against the other extreme of thinking the mere external possession of such privileges will ensure salvation. Moreover, had there been seven sacraments, as Rome teaches, Paul would have alluded to them, whereas he refers to only the two. He does not mean by "the same" that the Israelites and we Christians have the "same" sacrament; but that believing and unbelieving Israelites alike had "the same" spiritual privilege of the manna (compare 1Co 10:17). It was "spiritual meat" or food; because given by the power of God's spirit, not by human labor [Grotius and Alford] Ga 4:29, "born after the Spirit," that is, supernaturally. Ps 78:24, "corn of heaven" (Ps 105:40). Rather, "spiritual" in its typical signification, Christ, the true Bread of heaven, being signified (Joh 6:32). Not that the Israelites clearly understood the signification; but believers among them would feel that in the type something more was meant; and their implicit and reverent, though indistinct, faith was counted to them for justification, of which the manna was a kind of sacramental seal. "They are not to be heard which feign that the old fathers did look only for transitory promises" [Article VII, Church of England], as appears from this passage (compare Heb 4:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Those of the Jews that perished in the wilderness, did all eat the same manna which Caleb and Joshua ate of, who went into Canaan; or, those Jews that so perished in the wilderness did eat the same spiritual meat that we do, they in the type, we in the antitype.

Meaning the manna; and which the Jews also call (h) , "spiritual food", as also their sacrifices, (i) , "spiritual bread": not that the manna was so in own nature; it was corporeal food, and served for the nourishment of the body; but either because it was prepared by angels, who are ministering spirits, at the command of God, and hence called angels' food, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-25.htm">Psalm 78:25</a> or rather because it had a mystical and spiritual meaning in it; it was not the true bread, but was typical of Christ, who is so: it resembled Christ in its original; it was prepared of God, as Christ is, as his salvation prepared before the face of all his people; it was the free gift of God, as Christ is to the mystical Israel; it came down from heaven, as Christ, the true bread of life did: it answered to him in its nature; it was in form round, expressive of his being from everlasting to everlasting, and of the perfection both of his divine and human natures; it was in colour white, signifying his purity of nature, and holiness of life and conversation; it was in quantity small, setting forth his outward meanness and despicableness in the eyes of men; and in quality it was sweet in taste, as Christ, and all the blessings and fruits of his grace are to believers. The usefulness of the manna was very great, a vast number, even all the Israelites, were supplied with it, and supported by it for forty years together, as all the elect of God, and the whole family of Christ are by the fulness of grace which is in him; and as in order that it might be proper and suitable food, it was ground in mills, or beaten in a mortar, and baked in pans; so Christ was bruised, and wounded, and endured great sufferings, and death itself, that he might be agreeable food for our faith: and as the Israelites had all an equal quantity of this food, none had more or less than others, so all the saints have an equal share and interest in Christ, in his blood, righteousness, and sacrifice; as they have the same like precious faith, they have the same object of it. To say no more, as the manna was the food of the wilderness, or of the people of Israel, whilst travelling in it, so Christ, and the fulness of grace that is in him, are the food and supply of the spiritual Israel, and church of God, whilst they are passing through this world to the heavenly glory. Now, though all the Israelites did not eat of Christ, the true bread, which was typified by the manna; yet they all ate the same food, which had a spiritual meaning in it, and a respect to Christ, but did not all enter into the land flowing with milk and honey. <p>(h) Yade Mose in Shemot Rabba, fol. 109. 3.((i) Tzeror Hammor, fol. 93. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And did all eat the <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> same spiritual <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> meat;</span><p>(d) The same that we do.<p>(e) Manna, which was a spiritual meat to the believers, who in faith lay hold upon Christ, who is the true meat.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-3.htm" title="And did all eat the same spiritual meat;...">1 Corinthians 10:3-4</a>.

The relation denoted by <span class="greekheb">ἀκολουθούσης</span>, again, is assumed to be self-evident, and therefore no further explanation is given of the word. The thoughts, to which Paul here gives expression, are the following:—(1) To guard and help the Israelites in their journey through the wilderness, <span class="ital">Christ</span> accompanied them, namely, in His pre-existent divine nature, and consequently as the Son of God (= the <span class="greekheb">Λόγος</span> of John), who afterwards appeared as man (comp <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/10-15.htm" title="She delivered the righteous people and blameless seed from the nation that oppressed them.">Wis 10:15</a> ff.). (2) The <span class="ital">rock</span>, from which the water that they drank flowed, was not an ordinary natural rock, but a <span class="greekheb">πέτρα πνευματική</span>; not the mere appearance or phantasm of a rock, but an actual one, although of supernatural and heavenly origin, inasmuch as it was the <span class="ital">real self-revelation and manifestation</span> of the Son of God, who invisibly accompanied the host on its march; it was, in other words, the <span class="ital">very Christ</span> from heaven, as being His own substantial and efficient presentation of Himself to men (comp Targ. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-1.htm" title="Send you the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the wilderness, to the mount of the daughter of Zion.">Isaiah 16:1</a>, and Philo’s view, p. 1103 A, that the rock was the <span class="greekheb">σοφία</span>). (3) Such being the state of the case as to the rock, it must of necessity be a rock that <span class="ital">followed</span>, that <span class="ital">accompanied</span> and <span class="ital">went with</span> the children of Israel in their way through the desert; for Christ in His pre-existent condition, the heavenly “substratum,” so to speak, of this rock, went constantly with them, so that everywhere in the wilderness His essential presence could manifest itself in their actual experience through the rock with its abundant water; and, in point of fact, did so manifest itself again and again. In drinking from the <span class="ital">rock</span>, they had their thirst quenched by <span class="ital">Christ</span>, who, making the rock His form of manifestation, supplied the water <span class="ital">from Himself</span>, although <span class="ital">this</span> marvellous speciality about the way in which their thirst was met remained hidden from the Israelites.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Since the apostle’s words thus clearly and completely explain themselves, we have no right to ascribe to Paul, what was a later invention of the Rabbins, the notion that <span class="ital">the rock rolled along after the marching host</span> (<span class="ital">Bammidbar, R. S.</span> 1; Onkelos on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/21-18.htm" title="The princes dig the well, the nobles of the people dig it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:...">Numbers 21:18-20</a>; and see Wetstein and Schöttgen, also Lund, <span class="ital">Heiligth.</span>, ed. Wolf, p. 251); such fictions as these, when compared with what the apostle actually says, should certainly be regarded as extravagant aftergrowths (in opposition to Rückert and de Wette). It is just as unwarrantable, however, to explain away, by any exegetical expedient, this rock which followed them, and which was Christ. The attempts which have been made with this view run directly counter to the plain meaning of the words; <span class="ital">e.g.</span> the interpretation of Erasmus, Beza, Calvin, Piscator, Drusius, Grotius, Lightfoot, Billroth, <span class="ital">al</span>[1587] (which dates from Theodore of Mopsuestia), that the rock means here what came from it, <span class="ital">the water</span> (!), which, they hold, followed the people and <span class="ital">prefigured</span> Christ (<span class="greekheb">ἦν</span>). That <span class="greekheb">ἦν</span> denotes here <span class="ital">significabat</span> (so too Augustine, Vatablus, Salmasius, Bengel, Loesner, <span class="ital">al</span>[1588]), is a purely arbitrary assumption, seeing that Paul neither <span class="ital">says</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐστί</span>, nor <span class="greekheb">τύπος ἦν</span>, or the like, nor even <span class="ital">indicates</span> in any way in the context a typico-allegorical reference. This applies also against what Ch. F. Fritzsche has in his <span class="ital">Nova opusc</span>. p. 261: “The rock in the wilderness was a rock of blessing, strength, and life-giving for the Jews, and thus it <span class="ital">prefigures</span> Christ,” etc. Paul does not say anything of the sort; it is simply his expositors who insert it on their own authority. Baur, too, does violence to the apostle’s words (comp his <span class="ital">neut. Theol.</span> p. 193), by asserting that Paul speaks of Christ as the <span class="greekheb">πνευμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πέτρα</span> only in so far as he saw a <span class="ital">type</span> which had reference to Christ in the rock that followed the Israelites, according to the allegoric interpretation which he put upon it.[1590] See, in opposition to this, Räbiger, <span class="ital">Christol. Paul.</span> p. 31 f.; Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> p. 319. The <span class="ital">ordinary</span> exposition comes nearer to the truth, but fails to reach it in this respect, that it does not keep firm enough hold of the statement, that “<span class="ital">that rock was Christ</span>,” and so of its <span class="ital">identity</span> with Him, but takes Christ to be the Rock only in an ideal and figurative sense, regarding Him as different from the rock from which the water flowed, but as the author of its supply. So, in substance, Chrysostom,[1591] Oecumenius, Theophylact, Melanchthon, Cornelius a Lapide, and many others, among whom are Flatt, Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. und Krit.</span> 1839, p. 835; Osiander, Neander, Hofmann.[1592]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1583] Bengel well says: “Si plura essent N. T. sacramenta, ceteris quoque simile quiddam posuisset Paulus.” At the same time, it should be observed that the ecclesiastical notion of a sacrament does not appear in the N. T., but is an abstraction from the common characteristics of the two ordinances in question. Both, however, are equally essential and characteristic elements in the fellowship of the Christian life. Comp. Baur, <span class="ital">neut. Theol.</span> p. 200; Weiss, <span class="ital">bibl. Theol.</span> p. 353.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1587] <span class="ital">l.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1588] <span class="ital">l.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1590] Baur is wholly unwarranted in taking <span class="greekheb">πνευματικός</span>, ver. 3 f., in the sense of <span class="ital">typical</span> or <span class="ital">allegorically significant</span>. His appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-8.htm" title="And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified.">Revelation 11:8</a> and Barnab. 10 is irrelevant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1591] <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ ἡ τῆς πέτρας φύσις τὸ ὕδωρ ἠφίει φησὶν οὐ γὰρ ἂν καὶ πρὸ τούτου ἀνέβλυζεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλ ἑτέρα τις πέτρα πνευματικὴ τὸ πᾶν εἰργάζετο</span>, <span class="greekheb">τουτέστιν ὁ Χριστὸς ὁ παρὼν αὐτοῖς πανταχοῦ καὶ πάντα θαυματουργῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1592] Comp. his <span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> I. p. 171: “The rock from which the water flowed was a natural one, and stood fast in its own place; but the true Rock that really gave the water was the <span class="greekheb">צוּר יִשְׂרָאֵל</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm" title="You shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goes with a pipe to come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of Israel.">Isaiah 30:29</a>), was Jehovah, who went with Israel.” By not calling the Rock God, but Christ, the apostle points forward, as it were (according to Hofmann), to the application which he is about to make of the words, namely, to the cup which Christ gives us to drink. But Paul’s words are so simple, clear, and definite, that it is impossible to get off by any quid pro quo. For the rest, it is to be observed that in this passage, as in the previous one, where the crossing of the sea is taken as a typical prefiguration of baptism, we have doubtless a Rabbinical process of thought on the part of the apostle, which, as such, is not to be measured by the taste of our day, so that this unvarnished exegetical conception of it might be set down as something “absurd,” as is done by Hofmann. The Rabbinical culture of his time, under which the apostle grew up, was not done away with by the fact of his becoming the vessel of divine grace, revelation, and power. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-22.htm" title="For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, the one by a female slave, the other by a free woman.">Galatians 4:22</a> ff.

This identification our Lord virtually made in the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-37.htm" title="In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.">John 7:37</a>.
