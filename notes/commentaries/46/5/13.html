They are indeed sinners, and they deserve punishment for their crimes. But it is not ours to pronounce sentence upon them, or to inflict punishment. God will do that. our province is in regard to the church. We are to judge these; and these alone. All others we are to leave entirely in the hands of God.<p>Therefore - Greek "And" (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;  kai). "Since it is yours to judge the members of your own society, do you exercise discipline on the offender and put him away?"<p>Put away from among yourselves - Excommunicate him; expel him from your society. This is the utmost power which the church has; and this act the church is bound to exercise upon all those who have openly offended against the laws of Jesus Christ.<p>Remarks On <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5.htm">1 Corinthians 5</a><p>1. A public rumor with regard to the existence of an offence in the church should lead to discipline. This is due to the church itself that it may be pure and uninjured; to the cause, that religion may not suffer by the offence; and to the individual, that he may have justice done him, and his character vindicated if he is unjustly accused; or that if guilty he may be reclaimed and reformed - Offences should not be allowed to grow until they become scandalous; but when they do, every consideration demands that the matter should be investigated; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>.<p>2. People are often filled with pride when they have least occasion for it; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>. This is the case with individuals - who are often elated when their hearts are full of sin - when they are indulging in iniquity; and it is true of churches also, that they are most proud when the reins of discipline are relaxed, and their members are cold in the service of God, or when they are even living so as to bring scandal and disgrace on the gospel.<p>3. We see in what way the Christian church should proceed in administering discipline; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>. It should not be with harshness, bitterness, revenge, or persecution. It should be with mourning that there is necessity for it; with tenderness toward the offender; with deep grief that the cause of religion has been injured; and with such grief at the existence of the offence as to lead them to prompt and decided measures to remove it.<p>4. The exercise of discipline belongs to the church itself; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>. The church at Corinth was to be assembled with reference to this offence, and was to remove the offender. Even Paul, an apostle, and the spiritual father of the church, did not claim the authority to remove an offender except through the church. The church was to take up the case; to act on it; to pass the sentence; to excommunicate the man. There could scarcely be a stronger proof that the power of discipline is in the church, and is not to be exercised by any independent individual, or body of people, foreign to the church, or claiming an independent right of discipline. If "Paul" would not presume to exercise such discipline independently of the church, assuredly no minister, and no body of ministers have any such right now. Either by themselves in a collective congregational capacity, or through their representatives in a body of elders, or in a committee appointed by them; every church is itself originate and execute all the acts of Christian discipline over its members. (See the supplementary note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-4.htm">1 Corinthians 5:4</a>.)<p>5. We see the object of Christian discipline; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. It is not revenge, hatred, malice, or the more exercise of power that is to lead to it; it is "the good of the individual" that is to be pursued and sought. While the church endeavors to remain pure, its aim and object should be mainly to correct and reform the offender, that his spirit may be saved. When discipline is undertaken from any other motive than this; when it is pursued from private pique or rivalship, or ambition, or the love of power; when it seeks to overthrow the influence or standing of another, it is wrong. The salvation of the offender and the glory of God should prompt to all the measures which should be taken in the case.<p>6. We see the danger of indulging in any sin - both in reference to ourselves as individuals, or to the church; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm">1 Corinthians 5:6</a>. The smallest sin indulged in will spread pollution through the whole body, as a little leaven will effect the largest mass.<p>7. Christians should be pure; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-7.htm">1 Corinthians 5:7-8</a>. Their Saviour - their paschal lamb, was pure; and he died that they might be pure. He gave himself that his people might be holy; and by all the purity of his character; by all the labors and self-denials of his life; by all his sufferings and groans in our behalf, are we called on to be holy.<p>8. We are here presented with directions in regard to our contact with those who are not members of the church; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-10.htm">1 Corinthians 5:10</a>. There is nothing that is more difficult to be understood than the duty of Christians respecting such contact. Christians often feel that they are in danger from it, and they are disposed to withdraw almost entirely from the world. And they ask with deep solicitude often, what course they are to pursue? Where shall the line be drawn? How far shall they go? And where shall they deem the contact with the world unlawful or dangerous? - A few remarks here as rules may aid us in answering these questions.<p>(I) Christians are not wholly to withdraw from contact with the people of this world. This was the error of the monastic system, and this error has been the occasion of innumerable corruptions and abominations in the papal church - They are not to do this because:<p>(a) It is impossible. They must needs then, says Paul, go out of the world.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. put away from among yourselves that wicked&#8212;Sentence of excommunication in language taken from De 24:7.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But them that are without God judgeth; </span> for heathens that live brutish and scandalous lives, God will judge them; the church hath nothing to do with them, they never gave up themselves to them, and are only under the justice of God in the administrations of his providence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person:</span> do you, therefore, what belongs to you to do.

This statement appears more weighty and striking when taken as a sentence by itself, than as a continuation of the question (and still in dependence upon <span class="greekheb">οὐχί</span>; so Lachmann, Rückert, Olshausen, Hofmann). The accentuation <span class="greekheb">κρινεῖ</span>—although preferred by Luther, Grotius, Estius, Wetstein, Bengel, Valckenaer, <span class="ital">al</span>[850], Lachmann, Scholz, Rückert, Olshausen, Tischendorf, Ewald, Hofmann (in accordance with Arm., Copt., Vulgate, Chrysostom, <span class="ital">al</span>[851])—is to be rejected, because it is clear from the context, that so far from there being any necessity for the reference to the last judgment which would give occasion for the <span class="ital">future</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-6.htm" title="God forbid: for then how shall God judge the world?">Romans 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm" title="In the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel.">Romans 2:16</a>), on the contrary the present <span class="greekheb">κρίνει</span> (Erasmus, Castalio, Beza, Calvin, <span class="ital">al</span>[852], Pott, de Wette) corresponds in much the most natural way to the preceding <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΝΕΙΝ</span></span></span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΝΕΤΕ</span></span></span>. According to this view, then, the future judgment is neither exclusively pointed to by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΝΕΙ</span></span></span>, nor is it thereby excluded; but the judgment of those who are non-Christians is described <span class="ital">generally as a matter for God</span>, whenever and however it may take place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul has now ended his more definite explanation and correction as regards that misunderstood statement in his letter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm" title="I wrote to you in an letter not to company with fornicators:">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>. But for the Corinthians what more direct inference could be drawn from this explanation, than the duty of expelling the offender already spoken of, whom they should indeed have excluded before (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>)? Hence the apostle adds, without further preface (note, too, the <span class="ital">aorist</span>), the brief categorical command: <span class="greekheb">ἐξάρατε <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[853] This injunction corresponds so exactly to the LXX. version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-7.htm" title="If a man be found stealing any of his brothers of the children of Israel, and makes merchandise of him, or sells him; then that thief shall die; and you shall put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>, that it must be set down as simply arbitrary to deny that the form of expression here was purposely selected from remembrance of that passage. <span class="greekheb">Μωσαϊκὴν τέθεικε μαρτυρίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">θείῳ νόμῳ βεβαιώσας τὸν λόγον</span>. Theodoret. Hofmann conjectures that Paul wrote <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξαρεῖ τε</span>, and that this meant: “<span class="ital">and no less will He</span> (<span class="ital">God</span>) <span class="ital">also take away the wicked one</span> (those who are wicked in general) <span class="ital">from the midst of you</span>;” but this is neither critically established—since the <span class="ital">Recept</span>[854] <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐξαρεῖτε</span> is on critical grounds to be utterly rejected—nor grammatically admissible, for the assumed use of <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">τέ</span> is foreign both to Attic prose and to the N. T.;[855] nor, finally, is it in accordance with the context, for <span class="greekheb">τὸν πονηρόν</span> manifestly refers to the specific malefactor of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>, and to his exclusion from the church; comp Augustine: “<span class="greekheb">τὸν πονηρόν</span>, quod est <span class="ital">hunc</span> malignum.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν αὐτῶν</span>] is more expressive than the simple <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>: <span class="ital">out of your own midst</span>, in which you have hitherto tolerated him.

Matthiae, § 626, p. 1504 f.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul has ended what he had to say against the party-divisions in chap. 4. That the evils censured in chap. 5 (and 6) had any connection in point of principle with the party-divisions, is a view which finds no trace of support in the apostle’s way of speaking of them. Hence, too, it is impossible to prove that the persons at whom Paul’s censures were levelled belonged to any one special party, and if so, to which. In particular, we must refrain from attempting to refer the <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span> in question, and its odious manifestation, to one definite party, and to the principles held by it, whether to the <span class="ital">Pauline</span> section (Neander), or the <span class="ital">Christ-party</span> (Olshausen, Jaeger, Kniewel), or the <span class="ital">Apollonians</span> (Räbiger). This much only may be regarded as certain, that the misuse of Christian freedom, so far as that <span class="ital">in principle</span> lay at the root of the mischief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>), cannot be charged upon the <span class="ital">Petrine</span> party.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-13.htm" title="But them that are without God judges.
