This was the highest degree of punishment in the Christian Church; and we may observe, the passing this sentence was the act of the apostle, not of the Corinthians: whereupon usually followed terrors of conscience, and bodily pains or diseases inflicted by Satan, the terrible executioner of the divine justice and displeasure. <span class="ital">For the destruction </span>— Though slowly and gradually; <span class="ital">of the flesh </span>— Unless prevented by speedy repentance; <span class="ital">that the spirit </span>— Being brought to true contrition and humiliation; <span class="ital">may be saved — </span>From those infinitely more insupportable and everlasting agonies to which it might otherwise be doomed. It was observed, in the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>, that the apostles were empowered to punish notorious offenders miraculously with diseases and death. And doubtless the command here given by the apostle to deliver the incestuous person to Satan, was an exertion of that power, especially as it was to be done at the command of the inspired apostle, and by the power of the Lord Jesus. “Accordingly Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Œcumenius conjectured, that in consequence of his being delivered to Satan, the offender’s body was weakened and wasted by some painful disease. The Latin fathers and Beza, however, thought no such effect followed that sentence; because when the Corinthians were ordered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="So that contrariwise you ought rather to forgive him, and comfort him, lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow.">2 Corinthians 2:7</a>) to forgive him, no mention is made of any bodily disease that was to be removed from him. Wherefore, by the <span class="ital">destruction of the flesh, </span>they understood the destruction of the offender’s <span class="ital">pride, lust, </span>and other <span class="ital">fleshly passions; </span>which they thought would be mortified, when he found himself despised and shunned by all. This interpretation, however, does not, in my opinion,” says Macknight, “agree with the threatenings written <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="This is the third time I am coming to you. In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established....">2 Corinthians 13:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; nor with the apostle’s design in inflicting that punishment. For when the faction found the offender’s flesh wasted by some grievous disease, in consequence of the apostle’s sentence, it could not fail to terrify such of them as were capable of serious thought.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I verily - But I, whatever it may cost me; however you may esteem my interference; and whatever personal ill-will may be the result toward me, have adjudged this case to be so flagrant as to demand the exercise of discipline, and since the church to whom it belongs have neglected it, I use the authority of an apostle, and of a spiritual father, in directing it to take place. This was not a formal sentence of excommunication; but it was the declared opinion of an apostle that such a sentence should be passed, and an injunction on the church to exercise this act of discipline.<p>As absent in body - Since I am not personally present with you, I express my opinion in this manner. I am absent in body from you, and cannot, therefore, take those steps in regard to it which I could were Ipresent.<p>But present in spirit - My heart is with you; my feelings are with you; I have a deep and tender interest in the case; and I judge as if I were personally present. Many suppose that Paul by this refers to a power which was given to the apostles, though at a distance, to discern the real circumstances of a case by the gift of the Spirit. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-5.htm">Colossians 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/5-26.htm">2 Kings 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-12.htm">2 Kings 6:12</a>. (Whitby, Doddridge, etc.) But the phrase does not demand this interpretation. Paul meant, probably, that though he was absent, yet his mind and attention had been given to this subject; he felt as deeply as though he were present, and would act in the same way. He had, in some way, been fully apprized of all the circumstances of the case, and he felt it to be his duty to express his views on the subject.<p>Have judged already - Margin, "Determined" &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  kekrika.

It was a case in which the course which ought to be pursued was plain, and on this point his mind was settled. What that course should be he states immediately.<p>As though I were present - As though I had a personal knowledge of the whole affair, and were with you to advise - We may be certain that Paul had the fullest information as to this case; and that the circumstances were well known. Indeed, it was a case about the facts of which there could be no doubt. They were everywhere known <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>, and there was no need, therefore, to attempt to establish them by formal proof. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. as absent&#8212;The best manuscripts read, "being absent."<p>present in spirit&#8212;(2Ki 5:26; Col 2:5).<p>so done&#8212;rather, "perpetrated," as the Greek word here is stronger than that for "done" in 1Co 5:2.

Here we have the method of excommunication pursued in the Apostolic Church. It is important to observe it narrowly. First, it is to be remarked that the Apostle is acting not only as the president, but as the founder of the Corinthian Church. Next we remark that the whole Church at Corinth was associated with him in the work. “When ye are gathered together, and my spirit.” Hence it came to pass that in primitive times it was usual for such acts of discipline to be carried out in the presence of the Church or congregation in which the offender was accustomed to worship. Thirdly, it is observable that such excommunication was pronounced ‘in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,’ that is, with His authority and in accordance with His Divine Law of purity and love, whereby, while hating the sin, He desired to convert the offender.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">have judged already</span>] This may either be taken (1) as in the Authorized Version, with the word <span class="ital">concerning</span> inserted before <span class="ital">him that hath so done this deed</span>, or (2) these last words may be regarded as the accusative after “deliver,” and the word “judged” taken absolutely. The former appears preferable, but the whole passage is very intricate.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">concerning him that hath so done this deed</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">he that hath perpetrated this deed in such a manner</span>, i.e. as though to add to the guilt and shame of it by his way of doing it.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐγὼ μὲν γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">I indeed for my part</span>) An antithesis between the lighter punishment, which would have been inflicted by the Corinthians, and the severer one, which is threatened by Paul: thence also we have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-2.htm" title="And you are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he that has done this deed might be taken away from among you.">1 Corinthians 5:2</a>, <span class="greekheb">ποιήσας</span>, <span class="ital">he that hath done</span>, a gentler expression; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm" title="For I truly, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that has so done this deed,">1 Corinthians 5:3</a> <span class="greekheb">κατεργασάμενον</span>, <span class="ital">he that hath perpetrated</span>, a much more severe expression.

The "so" means "with all these circumstances of aggravation." The same verb is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-27.htm">Romans 1:27</a>. The broken periods of the Greek reflect the emotion of the writer. The passage is as it were written with sobs (Wordsworth). </body></html>
