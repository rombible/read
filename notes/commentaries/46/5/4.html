Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a>). In this sentence we recognise, not merely a formal excommunication from church-fellowship, but a more severe punishment, which could only be inflicted by apostolic authority and power. Satan was regarded as the origin of all physical evil—hence the afflicted woman, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-16.htm" title="And ought not this woman, being a daughter of Abraham, whom Satan has bound, see, these eighteen years, be loosed from this bond on the sabbath day?">Luke 13:16</a>, is spoken of as one “whom Satan hath bound these eighteen years.” St. Paul’s own bodily suffering is a “messenger of Satan” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm" title="And lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.">2Corinthians 12:7</a>). The blindness of Elymas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm" title="But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith.">Acts 13:8</a>), and the death of Ananias and Sapphira (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a>), are instances of the infliction of bodily-suffering by the Apostles. The deliverance of an offender unto Satan would therefore mean the expulsion of such a one from the Christian communion, and if that failed the actual infliction of some bodily suffering such as would destroy the flesh (not the body, but the flesh, the source and origin of the evil). Explicit directions for the excommunication by the Church of an offender, are given in 1 Corinthians 7, but there is no direct instruction to inflict the further punishment spoken of here. It is, indeed, probable that the lesser punishment had the desired effect (see Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="Sufficient to such a man is this punishment, which was inflicted of many.">2Corinthians 2:6</a>), and we subsequently find St. Paul pleading for the loving re-admission of the offender into all the privileges of Christian communion.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-8 The apostle notices a flagrant abuse, winked at by the Corinthians. Party spirit, and a false notion of Christian liberty, seem to have saved the offender from censure. Grievous indeed is it that crimes should sometimes be committed by professors of the gospel, of which even heathens would be ashamed. Spiritual pride and false doctrines tend to bring in, and to spread such scandals. How dreadful the effects of sin! The devil reigns where Christ does not. And a man is in his kingdom, and under his power, when not in Christ. The bad example of a man of influence is very mischievous; it spreads far and wide. Corrupt principles and examples, if not corrected, would hurt the whole church. Believers must have new hearts, and lead new lives. Their common conversation and religious deeds must be holy. So far is the sacrifice of Christ our Passover for us, from rendering personal and public holiness unnecessary, that it furnishes powerful reasons and motives for it. Without holiness we can neither live by faith in him, nor join in his ordinances with comfort and profit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the name ... - By the authority; or in the behalf; or acting by his commission or power. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-10.htm">2 Corinthians 2:10</a>. See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm">Acts 3:6</a>. This does not refer to Paul alone in declaring his opinion, but means that they were to be assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus, and that they were to proceed to exercise discipline by his authority. The idea is, that the authority to administer discipline is derived from the Lord Jesus Christ, and is to be exercised in his name, and to promote his honor.<p>When ye are gathered together - Or, "You being assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus." This is to be connected with the previous words, and means:<p>(1) That they were to be assembled for the purpose of administering discipline; and,<p>(2) That this was to be done in the name and by the authority of the Lord Jesus.<p>And my spirit - <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3</a>. As if I were with you; that is, with my declared opinion; knowing what I would advise, were I one of you; or, I being virtually present with you by having delivered my opinion. It cannot mean that Paul's soul would be really present with them, but that, knowing his views and feelings, and what he would do, and knowing his love for them, they could act as if he were there. This passage proves that discipline belongs to the church itself; and so deep was Paul's conviction of this, that even he would not administer it, without their concurrence and action. And if Paul would not do it, and in a case too where bodily pains were to be inflicted by miraculous agency, assuredly no other ministers have a right to assume the authority to administer discipline without the action and the concurrence of the church itself.<p>(The general doctrine of the New Testament is that the government of the church is invested, not in the people or church members at large, but in certain rulers or office-bearers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11-12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-12.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-7.htm">Hebrews 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. We find these elders or rulers existing in every church to which our attention is directed, while the people are continually exhorted to yield a willing submission to their authority. Now the passage under review must be explained in consistency with the analogy of truth, or the general scope of Scripture on the subject. It is unwise to build our conclusion on an insulated text. But, in reality, the language of the apostle, in this place, when fairly examined, gives no countenance to the idea that the judicial power of the church resides in the people. The case of the incestuous man was "judged by the apostle himself" previous to the transmission of his letter to the Corinthian church, which was therefore enjoined, not to adjudicate on the matter, but simply to give effect to the decision of Paul. "I verily 'have judged already' concerning him who hath done this deed; in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ," etc. If it be still demanded why then were the people to assemble? the answer is obvious. It was necessary that the sentence should be published, where the crime had been committed, that the members of the church might concur in it, and withdraw from the society of the guilty person. The simple fact of the people being assembled is no proof that they were judges.<p>Yet candor requires us to state that the words in the third verse, &#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;  e&#772;de&#772; kekrika (I have already judged) are supposed by some to intimate, not the delivering of an authoritative sentence, but the simple expression of an opinion in regard to what ought to be done. This, however, seems neither consistent with the scope of the passage, nor with just ideas of apostolical authority. The apostles had "the care of all the churches, with power to settle matters of faith and order, to determine controversies, and exercise the rod of discipline on all offenders, whether pastors or flock; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-3.htm">1 Corinthians 5:3-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>.")<p>With the power ... - This phrase is to be connected with the following verse. "I have determined what ought to be done. The sentence which I have passed is this. You are to be assembled in the name and authority of Christ. I shall be virtually present. And you are to deliver such a one to Satan, 'by the power of our Lord Jesus Christ.'" That is, it is to be done by you; and the miraculous power which will be evinced in the case will proceed from the Lord Jesus. The word "power" &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  dunamis is used commonly in the New Testament to denote some miraculous and extraordinary power; and here evidently means that the Lord Jesus would put forth such a power in the infliction of pain and for the preservation of the purity of his church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ&#8212;By His authority and as representing His person and will (2Co 2:10). Join this with "to deliver such a one unto Satan" (1Co 5:5). The clause, "When ye have been gathered together and my spirit (wherein I am 'present,' though 'absent in body,' 1Co 5:3), with the power of our Lord Jesus," stands in a parenthesis between. Paul speaking of himself uses the word "spirit"; of Christ, "power." Christ's power was promised to be present with His Church "gathered together in His name" (Mt 18:18-20): and here Paul by inspiration gives a special promise of his apostolic spirit, which in such cases was guided by the Holy Spirit, ratifying their decree passed according to his judgment ("I have judged," 1Co 5:3), as though he were present in person (Joh 20:21-23; 2Co 13:3-10). This power of infallible judgment was limited to the apostles; for they alone had the power of working miracles as their credentials to attest their infallibility. Their successors, to establish their claim to the latter, must produce the former (2Co 12:2). Even the apostles in ordinary cases, and where not specially and consciously inspired, were fallible (Ac 8:13, 23; Ga 2:11-14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ; </span> either having solemnly called upon the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for his counsel and direction, or blessing your action, that it may be of spiritual advantage to the party concerned; or according to the command of Christ, or by his authority, or for his glory.

Four different ways of dividing the verse are possible: <span class="ital">either</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀνόμ</span>. belongs to <span class="greekheb">συναχθ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">σὺν τῇ δυν</span>. to <span class="greekheb">παραδοῦναι</span> (Beza, Justiniani, Calovius, Heydenreich, Billroth, Olshausen, Ewald, Hofmann), <span class="ital">or</span> both belong to <span class="greekheb">συναχθ</span>. (Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Calvin, Grotius, Rückert), <span class="ital">or</span> both belong to <span class="greekheb">παραδοῦναι</span> (Mosheim, Pott, Flatt, Schrader, comp also Osiander); <span class="ital">or</span> <span class="greekheb">ἐν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀνόμ</span>. belongs to <span class="greekheb">παραδοῦναι</span>, and <span class="greekheb">σὺν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δυνάμ</span>. to the participial clause. Against the second and third of these views, there is the fact that the symmetry of the address would be needlessly destroyed by bringing in the authority of Christ twice over in the one division, and not at all in the other; against the first, again, there is this, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀνόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[773], as a <span class="ital">solemn formula of apostolic enactment</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-6.htm" title="Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you withdraw yourselves from every brother that walks disorderly, and not after the tradition which he received of us.">2 Thessalonians 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-18.htm" title="And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.

There remains therefore, as worthy of preference, the fourth method of connecting the words (Luther, Castalio, Estius, Bengel, Maier, <span class="ital">al</span>[776]; Neander with hesitation). Against this, Hofmann objects that <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῷ ὈΝΌΜΑΤΙ</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[777] ought not to have come in until after the participial clause; but quite under a misapprehension, for it is plainly of set purpose, and with all reason and propriety, that the apostolic sentence bears, so to speak, <span class="ital">on its very front</span> the seal of his <span class="ital">high and plenary authority</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">συναχθέντων</span> … <span class="greekheb">Ἰησοῦ</span>] <span class="ital">after ye are assembled, and my spirit</span> (note the emphatic <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐμοῦ</span>), <span class="ital">with the power of Jesus</span> (“qui nostram sententiam sua potentia reddet efficacem,” Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.). The substance of the thought, namely, which this whole statement sets before us with concrete vividness and solemnity, is the following: I have already resolved <span class="ital">that ye hold an assembly of the church, in which ye shall consider me as present furnished with the power of Christ, and in this assembly shall declare: “Paul, in the name of Christ, with whose power he is here spiritually in the midst of us, hereby delivers over the incestuous man unto Satan</span>.” <span class="greekheb">Φρίκης μεστὸν συνεκρότησε δικαστήριον</span>, Theodoret.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σύν</span>] denotes <span class="ital">in efficient connection therewith</span>, that is to say, the spirit of the apostle is present in the assembly, not in virtue of his own independent power (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a>), but clothed with the authority of Christ, Winer, p. 366 [E. T. 458]. Thus the power of Christ is not conceived as the third party in the assembly,—a view in behalf of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-20.htm" title="For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the middle of them.">Matthew 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm" title="Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have commanded you: and, see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world. Amen.">Matthew 28:20</a> are cited; so Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Estius, and others, including Rückert and Maier.[779] For Paul bore this power in himself, being as an apostle its official possessor and organ, and <span class="ital">could</span> not therefore imagine himself meeting with other persons and with it in the third place, but: as being present <span class="ital">in immanent union with it</span> as Christ’s apostle at the eventual act of judgment. It was just as the depositary of this power that he could give over the sinner to Satan in the name of the Lord, and be assured that the sentence would take effect. According to Hofmann, by <span class="greekheb">σὺν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δυν</span>. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[780] Paul means only to express this, that he <span class="ital">would rely upon the aid</span> of the power of Christ. Comp the classic <span class="greekheb">σὺν θεοῖς</span>, <span class="ital">deorum ope</span> (Reisig, <span class="ital">Enarr.</span> p. lxiv.; Kühner, <span class="ital">a</span>[782]<span class="ital"> Xen. Anab.</span> iii. 2. 8). But the thought thus yielded, after the <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[783] which has gone before it, would be far too weak.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[773] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[774] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[775] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[776] <span class="ital">l.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[777] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[779] Chrysostom and Theophylact, however, leave the choice open between the two renderings: <span class="greekheb">ἤ ὅτι ὁ Χριστὸς δύναται τοιαύτην ὑμῖν χάριν δοῦναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὥστε δύνασθκι τῷ διαβόλῳ παραδιδόναι</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἤ ὅτι καὶ αὐτός μεθʼ ὑμῶν κατʼ αὐτοῦ φέρει τὴν ψῆφον</span>. According to Theodoret, Christ is viewed as the <span class="ital">presiding authority</span>. Had the apostle, however, represented Christ to himself as forming the third in their meeting, he would hardly have used so abstract an expression (<span class="greekheb">δυνάμει</span>), but would have written at least <span class="greekheb">σὺν τῷ πνεύματι τοῦ Κυρίου</span>.

The clause may either be taken with "when ye are gathered together," or with "to deliver" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">With the power of our Lord Jesus.</span> Each clause adds solemnity to the scene in which St. Paul imagines himself as standing with them in the spirit, and joining with the assembly of the Church, and armed with the authority of Christ, while he pronounces on the offender the sentence on which he had already determined. That he could claim "the power of the Lord" resulted from his possession of the Holy Spirit. and the special commission to bind and to loose, to remit and to retain, on earth, which Christ had entrusted to the apostles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-18.htm">Matthew 18:18, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-23.htm">John 20:23</a>). </body></html>
