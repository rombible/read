In things which are not indifferent, right or wrong is the sole test of action. In things indifferent you must look for some other guide, and you must regulate your conduct by the effect it may have on others. Your liberty, which arises from the bare fact of the indifferent nature of the thing, may become a stumbling-block to others, may be the cause of their taking a false step in the Christian course.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-9.htm" title="But take heed lest by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to them that are weak....">1 Corinthians 8:9-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">But take heed lest this liberty of yours </span>— To eat indifferently of such meats; <span class="ital">become a stumbling-block </span>— An occasion of doing what they judge unlawful; <span class="ital">to them that are weak </span>— Uninformed in the truth, or unsettled as to their knowledge of it. <span class="ital">For if any man see thee </span>— Whom he believes to have more knowledge than himself, and <span class="ital">who </span>really <span class="ital">hast </span>this <span class="ital">knowledge, </span>that <span class="ital">an idol is nothing; sit at meat in the idol’s temple </span>— To an entertainment there; <span class="ital">shall not the conscience of him that is weak </span>— Scrupulous; <span class="ital">be imboldened </span>— Encouraged by thy example; <span class="ital">to eat those things which are offered to idols </span>— Though with a doubting, or perhaps condemning conscience. <span class="ital">And through thy knowledge </span>— Thy abuse and unseasonable discovery of thy knowledge; <span class="ital">shall the weak brother perish </span>— Be drawn into sin, which is the way to destruction; <span class="ital">for whom Christ died</span> — And for whom thou wilt not lose a meal’s meat: so far art thou from laying down thy life for him! We see Christ died even for them that perish. Observe this, reader. <span class="ital">But when ye sin so </span>— Act so uncharitably and contrary to your duty; <span class="ital">against the brethren </span>— Who, as well as you, are the children and heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ; <span class="ital">and wound their weak conscience — </span>Their ill-informed and scrupulous consciences, leading them into guilt, and hazarding their salvation; <span class="ital">ye sin against Christ </span>— Whose members they are, and who had such regard for their souls, that he died in ignominy and torture to redeem them, and hath done all that example or precept could do, to make his followers enter into such humane and compassionate views. <span class="ital">Wherefore </span>— For a conclusion, I lay down this general rule, that all things indifferent in their own nature are to be forborne, when the use of them would be a cause of scandal, or an occasion of falling to others, of turning them out of the right way, or hindering them therein; yea, though such things may have a great deal of apparent expediency in them.

Of such importance do I esteem the preservation of one endangered soul: and in this, and other things of a similar nature, I pray that God may incline you to use the like self-denial for your own sakes, and for the peace and honour of the Christian Church. But who will follow this example? What preacher or private Christian will abstain from any thing and every thing, lawful in itself, when it offends a weak brother? <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-13 Eating one kind of food, and abstaining from another, have nothing in them to recommend a person to God. But the apostle cautions against putting a stumbling-block in the way of the weak; lest they be made bold to eat what was offered to the idol, not as common food, but as a sacrifice, and thereby be guilty of idolatry. He who has the Spirit of Christ in him, will love those whom Christ loved so as to die for them. Injuries done to Christians, are done to Christ; but most of all, the entangling them in guilt: wounding their consciences, is wounding him. We should be very tender of doing any thing that may occasion stumbling to others, though it may be innocent in itself. And if we must not endanger other men's souls, how much should we take care not to destroy our own! Let Christians beware of approaching the brink of evil, or the appearance of it, though many do this in public matters, for which perhaps they plead plausibly. Men cannot thus sin against their brethren, without offending Christ, and endangering their own souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But take heed - This is the reply of Paul to the argument of the Corinthians in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>. "Though all that you say should be admitted to be true, as it must be; though a man is neither morally better nor worse for partaking of meat or abstaining from it; yet the grand principle to be observed is, so to act as not to injure your brethren. Though you may be no better or worse for eating or not eating, yet if your conduct shall injure others, and lead them into sin, that is a sufficient guide to determine you what to do in the case. You should abstain entirely. It is of far more importance that your brother should not be led into sin, than it is that you should partake of meat which you acknowledge <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a> is in itself of no importance."<p>Lest by any means - &#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769; &#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;  me&#772; po&#772;s.
