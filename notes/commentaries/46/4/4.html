The Greek of the words rendered, “I know nothing of myself,” is clearly “I am not conscious in myself” of having been unfaithful; the word being almost invariably used in classical Greek in a bad sense. In the English version the word “by” is used in a sense now nearly obsolete. To an English reader the passage at first sight seems to assert that St. Paul of his own power possessed no knowledge. In old English, however, the word “by” meant (not necessarily the instrument <span class= "ital">by</span> which) frequently “in connection with” or “concerning.” In this sense it is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/27-16.htm" title="Cursed be he that sets light by his father or his mother. And all the people shall say, Amen.">Deuteronomy 27:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm" title="In you have they set light by father and mother: in the middle of you have they dealt by oppression with the stranger: in you have they vexed the fatherless and the widow.">Ezekiel 22:7</a>. In Foxe’s <span class= "ital">Book of Martyrs</span> a woman under examination is accused of having “spoken evil words <span class= "ital">by</span> the queen.” It is still common to speak of our place being “by” (<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> in close contiguity to) another, and a <span class= "ital">“bye-</span> lane” is a passage connected with a thoroughfare. The word “by” does not seem to have had necessarily the meaning of “against” which some have attributed to it; the sense of “concerning” would suit all the passages given above better than “against.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-6 Apostles were no more than servants of Christ, but they were not to be undervalued. They had a great trust, and for that reason, had an honourable office. Paul had a just concern for his own reputation, but he knew that he who chiefly aimed to please men, would not prove himself a faithful servant of Christ. It is a comfort that men are not to be our final judges. And it is not judging well of ourselves, or justifying ourselves, that will prove us safe and happy. Our own judgment is not to be depended upon as to our faithfulness, any more than our own works for our justification. There is a day coming, that will bring men's secret sins into open day, and discover the secrets of their hearts. Then every slandered believer will be justified, and every faithful servant approved and rewarded. The word of God is the best rule by which to judge as to men. Pride commonly is at the bottom of quarrels. Self-conceit contributes to produce undue esteem of our teachers, as well as of ourselves. We shall not be puffed up for one against another, if we remember that all are instruments, employed by God, and endowed by him with various talents.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I know nothing by myself - There is evidently here an ellipsis to be supplied, and it is well supplied by Grotius, Rosenmuller, Calvin, etc. "I am not conscious of evil, or unfaithfulness to myself; that is, in my ministerial life." It is well remarked by Calvin, that Paul does not here refer to the whole of his life, but only to his apostleship. And the sense is, "I am conscious of integrity in this office. My own mind does not condemn me of ambition or unfaithfulness. Others may accuse me, but I am not conscious of that which should condemn me, or render me unworthy of this office." This appeal Paul elsewhere makes to the integrity and faithfulness of his ministry. So his speech before the elders of Ephesus at Miletus; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-18.htm">Acts 20:18-19</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/20-26.htm">Acts 20:26-27</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-17.htm">2 Corinthians 12:17</a>. It was the appeal which a holy and faithful man could make to the integrity of his public life, and such as every minister of the gospel ought to be able to make.<p>Yet am I not hereby justified - I am not justified because I am not conscious of a failure in my duty. I know that God the judge may see imperfections where I see none. I know that I may be deceived; and therefore, I do not pronounce a judgment on myself as if it were infallible and final. It is not by the consciousness of integrity and faithfulness that I expect to be saved; and it does not follow that I claim to be free from all personal blame. I know that partiality to ourselves will often teach us to overlook many faults that others may discern in us.<p>He that judgeth me is the Lord - By his judgment I am to abide; and by his judgment I am to receive my eternal sentence, and not by my own view of myself. He searcheth the hearts. He may see evil where I see none. I would not, therefore, be self-confident; but would, with humility, refer the whole case to him. Perhaps there is here a gentle and tender reproof of the Corinthians, who were so confident in their own integrity; and a gentle admonition to them to be more cautious, as it was possible that the Lord would detect faults in them where they perceived none. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. by myself&#8212;Translate, "I am conscious to myself of no (ministerial) unfaithfulness." Bengel explains the Greek compound, "to decide in judgments on one in relation to others," not simply to judge.<p>am I not hereby justified&#8212;Therefore conscience is not an infallible guide. Paul did not consider his so. This verse is directly against the judicial power claimed by the priests of Rome.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I know nothing by myself; </span> nothing amiss, nothing that is evil; yet this must not be interpreted universally, as if St. Paul knew nothing that was evil and sinful by himself; himself, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/7-1.htm" title="Know you not, brothers, (for I speak to them that know the law,) how that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?...">Romans 7:1-25</a></span>, tells us the contrary; but it must be understood with respect to his discharge of his ministerial office: I do not know any thing wherein I have wilfully failed in the discharge of my ministry; yet even as to that I durst not stand upon my own righteousness and justification before God, I may have sinned ignorantly, or have forgotten some things wherein I did offend. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But he that judgeth me is the Lord; </span> God knoweth more of me than I know of myself, and it is he that judgeth, and must judge me. Though in this text Paul doth not speak of his whole life and conversation, but only of his conversation with respect to his ministry; yet the conclusion from hence, that no man can be justified from his own works, is good; for if a man cannot be justified from his conscience not rebuking him for his errors in one part of his conversation, he cannot be justified from his conscience not rebuking him for his whole conversation. For he that keepeth the whole law, if he offendeth but in one point, must be guilty of all, because the law curseth him who continueth not in every point of the law to do it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For I know nothing by myself,.... Which must be understood with a restriction to the subject he is upon, faithfulness in the ministry; otherwise he knew much by himself of indwelling sin, and the corruption of his nature, which he sometimes found very strong and prevalent in him, and of the daily infirmities of life; but as to his ministerial service, he was pure from the blood of all men; he honestly declared what he knew to be the mind of God, and concealed nothing that might be useful to men; in this he had a clear conscience, void of offence both towards God and men, <p>Yet am I not hereby justified; from all fault and blame, which might possibly escape his knowledge and observation; for in many things all offend, and no man can understand all his errors; and there might be some mistakes which the apostle was not privy to, or conscious of; and were he even free from all, he declares, that such an unstained integrity, in the discharge of his ministerial work, was not the matter of his justification before God, nor did he depend upon it: <p>but he that judgeth me is the Lord; either who adjudges me to eternal life, justifying me through the righteousness of his Son, in which alone I desire to be found, living and dying; or he that knows my heart, and all my ways, will be my judge at the last day; and to his judgment I appeal and submit, and sit easy in the mean while under all the censures and calumnies of men. The apostle did, as his Lord and Saviour had done before him, who, when he was reviled and reproached by men, conscious of his own innocence and integrity, committed himself to him that judgeth righteously. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> Lord.</span><p>(c) I submit myself to the Lord's judgment.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="For I know nothing by myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judges me is the Lord.">1 Corinthians 4:4</a>.

But seeing that I am <span class="ital">not</span> justified by this conscience (but by Christ), it cannot even serve me as a standard for self-judgment, and I must refrain therefrom, and leave the judgment regarding me to Christ.” This applies also against de Wette, who holds our exposition to be contrary to context, because what follows is not <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ δικαιῶν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ ἀνακρίνων</span>. Moreover, the further imputation of moral desert is certainly not done away with by justification, but it remains in force until the judgment. <span class="greekheb">Δεδικαίωμαι</span>, however, does not refer to the being found righteous at the day of judgment (against Lipsius, <span class="ital">Rechtfertigungsl.</span> p. 48), but, as the perfect shows, to the righteousness <span class="ital">obtained</span> by faith, which to the consciousness of the apostle was at all times a present blessing.—Observe further, how alien to Paul was the conception that the conscience is the expression of real <span class="ital">divine</span> life in the man.

We can hardly suppose that one who was so conscious of his many infirmities (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-17.htm" title="For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward: but if against my will, a dispensation of the gospel is committed to me.">1 Corinthians 9:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm" title="For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm" title="To me, who am less than the least of all saints, is this grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ;">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Who was before a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious: but I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.">1 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners; of whom I am chief.">1 Timothy 1:15</a>) supposed himself to be altogether free from faults. The next verse implies the contrary, and we read in an Epistle written long afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Php 3:13</a>), that he did not consider himself ‘already perfect,’ but as pushing on towards his only ideal of perfection, the character of his Master, Jesus Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">yet am I not hereby justified</span>] “There may be many sins which we commit without being aware of them.”—Chrysostom.

So the LXX. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γὰρ σύνοιδα ἐμαυτῷ ἄτοπα πράξας</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm" title="My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.">Job 27:6</a>. He, whom conscience accuses, is held as deciding in judgment on himself.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν τούτῳ δεδικαίωμαι</span>) <span class="ital">I am not justified in this</span>, if I decide in my own case. For the judgment remains. It is the Lord who will pronounce me justified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>. Paul may be regarded either as a judge, or a witness, in his own case. As a witness, he knows, that he is unconscious of any crime. As a judge, he dares not on that account decide in his own case, or pronounce himself to be justified.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνακρίνων με</span>) <span class="ital">He who decides in my case</span>, whose decision I do not decline, at His coming, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-5.htm" title="Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise of God.">1 Corinthians 4:5</a>, and who declares me justified.[32]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[32] <span class="greekheb">Κύριός ἐστιν</span>, <span class="ital">is the Lord</span>) Jesus Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>. He is mentioned along with God, as in ver. 1.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I know nothing by myself;</span> rather, <span class="accented">nothing against myself.</span> The phrase of the Authorized Version originally meant this, but is now obsolete in this sense. "I am sorry that each fault can be proved by the queen," says Cranmer to Henry VIII. It is like the Latin <span class="accented">Nil conscire sibi.</span> The same phrase occurs in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-6.htm">Job 27:6</a>. St. Paul says, "The verdict of my own conscience acquits me of all intentional unfaithfulness;" but this is insufficient, because God sees with clearer eyes than ours. "Who can understand his errors?" asks the psalmist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-12.htm">Psalm 19:12</a>); and the "secret faults" against which he prays are not hidden vices, but sins of which he was himself unconscious. It must be remembered that St. Paul is here only speaking with conscious integrity of his ministerial work. Nothing could have been further from the mind of one who elsewhere calls himself" the chief of sinners" than to claim an absolute immunity from every form of self reproach. They who claim immaculate holiness can as little quote the sanction of St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-27.htm">1 Corinthians 9:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-9.htm">1 Corinthians 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-8.htm">Ephesians 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm">Philippians 3:13</a>, etc.) as of any other saint. The confessions of the holiest are ever the most humble. <span class="cmt_word">Yet am I not hereby justified.</span> Because "every way of a man" is apt to be "right in his own eyes," but God pondereth the hearts, and therefore in God's sight "no man living is justified." St. Paul is here using the word in its legal rather than its theological sense. <span class="cmt_word">He that judgeth me is the Lord.</span> This is a reason for serious awe and deep self searching of heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/130-3.htm">Psalm 130:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-2.htm">Job 9:2</a>). Yet also for hope and confidence when a man can, like the modern statesman, "look from the storm without to the sunshine of an approving conscience within." For God, being "greater than our hearts" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-21.htm">1 John 3:21</a>), may count "the long 'yes' of life" against the one "no," or the single faithless minute. Knowing whereof we are made, remembering that we are but dust, he looks on us <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"With larger other eyes than ours,<br />To make allowance for us all."</span> </body></html>
