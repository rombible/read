The moment they heard the announcement that he was sending Timothy, they would naturally say, That is a proof of the truth of our assertion. He is afraid to come himself, so he sends Timothy in his stead. “But,” says St. Paul, “I will come to you shortly, God willing”—his intention was to remain at Ephesus until after Pentecost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-8.htm" title="But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost.">1Corinthians 16:8</a>)—“and then I shall take cognisance of spiritual power, and not of empty and boastful words; for that kingdom which Christ founded, and which we, his ambassadors, are establishing, does not consist in mere words, but in spiritual might.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-18.htm" title="Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you....">1 Corinthians 4:18-21</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now some are puffed up </span>— Are grown insolent; <span class="ital">as though I would not come </span>— To censure them for their misconduct, and to reform abuses; fancying that, because I have sent Timothy, I am not coming myself, being afraid to appear in a place where I have so many opposers.

Will you amend your ways, and reform what is amiss, that I may be kind and gentle toward you? The apostle, in speaking of <span class="ital">coming with a rod, </span>alludes to the power which he and the other apostles possessed of punishing obstinate offenders by miracle. For that they had often such a miraculous power, extending even in some cases of aggravated offence to the inflicting of temporal death, appears from several other passages of Scripture; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-5.htm" title="And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and gave up the ghost: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.">Acts 5:5</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-10.htm" title="And said, O full of all subtlety and all mischief, you child of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?">Acts 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm" title="But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.">Acts 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-20.htm" title="Of whom is Hymenaeus and Alexander; whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.">1 Timothy 1:20</a>;) and is referred to more than once or twice in these epistles to the Corinthians; (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="To deliver such an one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.">1 Corinthians 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-6.htm" title="And having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.">2 Corinthians 10:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm" title="For though I should boast somewhat more of our authority, which the Lord has given us for edification, and not for your destruction, I should not be ashamed:">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="I told you before, and foretell you, as if I were present, the second time; and being absent now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that, if I come again, I will not spare:...">2 Corinthians 13:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="Therefore I write these things being absent, lest being present I should use sharpness, according to the power which the Lord has given me to edification, and not to destruction.">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>.) And here we see the wisdom of Providence in permitting such opposition to arise against St. Paul, particularly at Corinth; as it gave him an opportunity of making the strongest appeals to what they knew of his miraculous power; appeals which, had they not been indeed founded on the most certain and evident truth, must, instead of restoring him to their regards, (as we find in fact they did,) have been sufficient of themselves utterly to have ruined all his reputation and interest among the Corinthians, had it before been ever so great. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:14-21 In reproving for sin, we should distinguish between sinners and their sins. Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now some are puffed up - They are puffed up with a vain confidence; they say that I would not dare to come; that I would be afraid to appear among them, to administer discipline, to rebuke them, or to supersede their authority. Probably he had been detained by the demand on his services in other places, and by various providential hinderances from going there, until they supposed that he stayed away from fear. And possibly he might apprehend that they would think he had sent Timothy because he was afraid to come himself.

Such persons persuaded themselves that they had so undermined his reputation that he would not dare to come again to Corinth, and they grew more self-asserting in consequence. But though St Paul submitted to contempt and insult from without, he demands the respect due to his office from those within. He bore the reproach of the infidel and scoffer: among his own people he acts upon the precept, ‘Let no man despise thee.’ Paley remarks on the undesigned coincidence between this passage and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;...">2 Corinthians 1:15-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-1.htm" title="But I determined this with myself, that I would not come again to you in heaviness.">2 Corinthians 2:1</a>.

Then indeed these puffed up thoughts suddenly arose in their minds; Paul himself, then, will not come. <span class="ital">A puffed up spirit</span> was the frequent fault prevalent among the Corinthians.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Are puffed up;</span> rather, <span class="accented">were puffed up</span>; at the time that they made these disparaging comparisons of me with others. <span class="cmt_word">As though I would not come to you;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as though I were not coming to you.</span> St. Paul was on the eve of starting for Macedonia on his way to visit them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>), but, owing to the grievous state of the Church, he subsequently changed his purpose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15, 23</a>). When he left them he had promised to return, "if God wilt" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>). His many enemies and critics were likely to say, "He is afraid to come himself, and so he sends Timothy." They flattered themselves that he was alarmed by their culture and intellectualism. </body></html>
