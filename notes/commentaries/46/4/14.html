This abrupt and sudden change in style is characteristic of the writings of St. Paul. Similar passages are nowhere to be found in the writings of the other Apostles. The following verses to the end of this chapter soften the severity of this early part of the Epistle by explaining in what spirit he has written, and the right which he has as their “father in the faith” to so address them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you....">1 Corinthians 4:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">I write not these things to shame you </span>— Publicly to disgrace you, and stain your credit with other churches; <span class="ital">but as my beloved sons I warn you </span>— Show you in a mild and tender way what is wrong in your conduct, and put you in mind of your duty.

This excludes, not only Apollos, his successor, but also Silas and Timothy, his companions.

Reproofs that kindly and affectionately warn, are likely to reform. Though the apostle spoke with authority as a parent, he would rather beseech them in love. And as ministers are to set an example, others must follow them, as far as they follow Christ in faith and practice. Christians may mistake and differ in their views, but Christ and Christian truth are the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever. Whenever the gospel is effectual, it comes not in word only, but also in power, by the Holy Spirit, quickening dead sinners, delivering persons from the slavery of sin and Satan, renewing them both inwardly and outwardly, and comforting, strengthening, and establishing the saints, which cannot be done by the persuasive language of men, but by the power of God. And it is a happy temper, to have the spirit of love and meekness bear the rule, yet to maintain just authority.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To shame you - It is not my design to put you to shame by showing you how little you suffer in comparison with us.

My design is higher and nobler than this.<p>But as my beloved sons - As my dear children. I speak as a father to his children, and I say these things for your good.

I say these things not to make, you blush, but with the hope that they may be the means of your reformation, and of a more holy life. No man, no minister, ought to reprove another merely to overwhelm him with shame, but the object should always be to make a brother better; and the admonition should be so administered as to have this end, not sourly or morosely, but in a kind, tender, and affectionate manner. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. warn&#8212;rather, "admonish" as a father uses "admonition" to "beloved sons," not provoking them to wrath (Eph 6:4).

Though they had a great deal of reason to be ashamed of the vain opinion they had of themselves, and that they suffered the faithful ministers of Christ to want the necessaries of life, when they abounded so much with the good things of it; and though the apostle's view in giving this narrative was to bring them under a sense of their faults, and to a conviction of them, and so to shame for them, in order to their future reformation and amendment; yet it was not merely to put them to the blush, but to admonish and instruct them, that he enlarged on these things: <p>but as my beloved sons I warn you; they being his children in a spiritual sense, for whom he had the strongest love and affection, as their spiritual Father; and as it was his place, and became him standing in such a relation to them, he warned, admonished, and put them in mind of their obligations and duty to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn <i>you</i>.</span><p>(10) Moderating the sharpness of his mockery, he puts them in mind to remember of whom they were begotten in Christ, and that they should not doubt to follow him for an example.

PAUL’S FATHERLY DISCIPLINE. All has now been said that can be concerning the Divisions at Cor[756]—the causes underlying them, and the spirit they manifest and foster in the Church. In their self-complacent, ungrateful thoughts, the Cor[757] have raised themselves quite above the despised and painful condition of the App. of Christ; “imitabantur filios qui illustrati parum curant humiles parentes—ex saturitate fastidium habebant, ex opulentia insolentiam, ex regno superbiam” (Bg[758]). The delineation of Paul’s state and theirs in the last Section is, in truth, a bitter sarcasm upon the behaviour of the readers; yet P. wishes to admonish, not to rebuke them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>). He states, in a softened tone, the measures he is taking to rectify the evils complained of. His severity springs from the anxious heart of a father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a> f.). Yet in the father’s hand, before the paragraph ends, we see again <span class="ital">the rod</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-21.htm" title="What will you? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?">1 Corinthians 4:21</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[756] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[757] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[758] Bengel’s <span class="ital">Gnomon Novi Testamenti.</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you</span>] The object of the foregoing passage might be mistaken, and therefore the Apostle refers to the mutual relation between himself and the Corinthian Church.

It is the rebuke of a father, not the strong language of a man justly indignant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-14.htm" title="I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.">1 Corinthians 4:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἐντρέπων</span>, <span class="ital">not making ashamed</span>) An exquisite epitherapeia.[36] The dissimilarity between themselves and Paul, between the sons and the father, might have made the Corinthians <span class="ital">ashamed</span>. This <span class="greekheb">Ἐντροπὴ</span>, <span class="ital">putting them to shame</span>, in the mind of the apostle, was not an end, but a means, as he says also on another occasion, that he was unwilling to make them sad, though he had actually done so. The apostle often introduces a certain degree of refined pleasantry, without forgetting the apostolic gravity, for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">νουθετῶ</span>, <span class="ital">I warn</span>) you as a father, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-4.htm" title="And, you fathers, provoke not your children to wrath: but bring them up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.">Ephesians 6:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[36] See App. An after addition to words, which might give offence, and a kind of softening of what went before by a declaration of friendly feeling towards the persons addressed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 14-21.</span> - <span class="accented">The practical steps which he intends to take with reference to these party divisions.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">To shame you.</span> Such seems to be the meaning of the word, for it is so used in the LXX.
