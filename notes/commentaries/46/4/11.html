Here still there is an implied contrast between their condition (“full,” “rich,” “kings,” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="Now you are full, now you are rich, you have reigned as kings without us: and I would to God you did reign, that we also might reign with you.">1Corinthians 4:8</a>) and that of St. Paul himself.<p><span class= "bld">Are naked.</span>—The better reading is, <span class= "ital">we are in need of sufficient clothing</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-27.htm" title="In weariness and painfulness, in watchings often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness.">2Corinthians 11:27</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Are buffeted</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> are treated like slaves, and not like “kings,” as you are.<p><span class= "bld">Have no certain dwellingplace.</span>—To be without a fixed home was a peculiar sign of want and degradation.

A sinner snatched from destruction by sovereign grace alone, must be very absurd and inconsistent, if proud of the free gifts of God. St. Paul sets forth his own circumstances, ver. 9. Allusion is made to the cruel spectacles in the Roman games; where men were forced to cut one another to pieces, to divert the people; and where the victor did not escape with his life, though he should destroy his adversary, but was only kept for another combat, and must be killed at last. The thought that many eyes are upon believers, when struggling with difficulties or temptations, should encourage constancy and patience. We are weak, but ye are strong. All Christians are not alike exposed. Some suffer greater hardships than others. The apostle enters into particulars of their sufferings. And how glorious the charity and devotion that carried them through all these hardships! They suffered in their persons and characters as the worst and vilest of men; as the very dirt of the world, that was to be swept away: nay, as the offscouring of all things, the dross of all things. And every one who would be faithful in Christ Jesus, must be prepared for poverty and contempt. Whatever the disciples of Christ suffer from men, they must follow the example, and fulfil the will and precepts of their Lord. They must be content, with him and for him, to be despised and abused. It is much better to be rejected, despised, and ill used, as St. Paul was, than to have the good opinion and favour of the world. Though cast off by the world as vile, yet we may be precious to God, gathered up with his own hand, and placed upon his throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even unto this present hour - Paul here drops the irony, and begins a serious recapitulation of his actual sufferings and trials. The phrase used here "unto this present hour" denotes that these things had been incessant through all their ministry. They were not merely at the commencement of their work, but they had continued and attended them everywhere. And even then they were experiencing the same thing. These privations and trials were still continued, and were to be regarded as a part of the apostolic condition.<p>We both hunger and thirst - The apostles, like their master, were poor, and in traveling about from place to place, it often happened that they scarcely found entertainment of the plainest kind, or had money to purchase it. It is no dishonor to be poor, and especially if that poverty is produced by doing good to others. Paul might have been rich, but he chose to be poor for the sake of the gospel. To enjoy the luxury of doing good to others, we ought to be willing to be hungry and thirsty, and to be deprived of our ordinary enjoyments.<p>And are naked - In traveling; our clothes become old and worn out, and we have no friends to replace them, and no money to purchase new. It is no discredit to be clad in mean raiment, if that is produced by self-denying toils in behalf of others. There is no, honor in gorgeous apparel; but there is real honor in voluntary poverty and want, when produced in the cause of benevolence. Paul was not ashamed to travel, to preach, and to appear before princes and kings, in a soiled and worn-out garment, for it was worn out in the service of his Master, and Divine Providence had arranged the circumstances of his life. But how many a minister now would he ashamed to appear in such clothing! How many professed Christians are ashamed to go to the house of God because they cannot dress well, or be in the fashion, or outshine their neighbors! If an apostle was willing to be meanly clad in delivering the message of God, then assuredly we should be willing to preach, or to worship him in such clothing as he provides. We may add here, what a sublime spectacle was here; and what a glorious triumph of the truth. Here was Paul with an impediment in his speech; with a personage small and mean rather than graceful; and in a mean and tattered dress; and often in chains, yet delivering truth before which kings trembled, and which produced everywhere a deep impression on the human mind. Such was the power of the gospel then! And such triumph did the truth then have over men. See Doddridge.<p>And are buffeted - Struck with the hand; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-67.htm">Matthew 26:67</a>. Probably it is used here to denote harsh and injurious treatment in general; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-7.htm">2 Corinthians 12:7</a>.<p>And have no certain dwelling-place - No fixed or permanent home. They wandered to distant lands; threw themselves on the hospitality of strangers, and even of the enemies of the gospel; when driven from one place they went to another; and thus they led a wandering, uncertain life, amidst strangers and foes. They who know what are the comforts of home; who are surrounded by beloved families; who have a peaceful and happy fireside; and who enjoy the blessings of domestic tranquility, may be able to appreciate the trials to which the apostles were subjected. All this was for the sake of the gospel; all to purchase the blessings which we so richly enjoy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

Epict.</span> iii. 22. 78). The simple <span class="greekheb">κάθαρμα</span> is more common; and it especially is often found in this figurative sense in Demosthenes and later writers (see Wetstein, Loesner, <span class="ital">Obss.</span> p. 276 f.; comp also Kühner, II. p. 26). With this rendering Erasmus, H.

According to this view, the sense would be: “contemnimur ut homines, qui ad iram Deorum ab omnibus hominibus avertendam sacrificio offeruntur,” Pott; and Olshausen asserts, in spite of the <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, that Paul ascribes a certain power even to his sufferings. Now the current and constant word for the <span class="ital">expiatory offering</span> is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΆΘΑΡΜΑ</span></span></span> (not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡΙΚΆΘΑΡΜΑ</span></span></span>);[695] but, even supposing that Paul had conceived <span class="greekheb">περικαθάρματα</span> as <span class="ital">piacula</span>, he would in that case have again used the <span class="ital">Plural</span> <span class="greekheb">περιψήματα</span> in the next clause, for <span class="greekheb">περίψημα</span> is synonymous with <span class="greekheb">περικάθαρμα</span>, and each individual would be a <span class="ital">piaculum</span>.
