There is, however, a great variety of readings as to the actual mode of expression of this thought. One suggestion is that the words may read thus:—“It were better for me to die than (receive reward from you); no man shall make my ground of boasting void.” Another is; “It were better for me to die, rather than any one should make my ground of boasting void.” There is great weight in favour of both of these readings. The following have also been suggested as possible readings of the passage:—“It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting should die; no one shall make it void;” and “It were better for me to die than that my ground of boasting ——; no man shall make it void.” In this last case the Apostle pauses in the middle of his impassioned declaration, and leaves the sentence unfinished, as he flings aside the thought that his ground of boasting could be removed, and exclaims earnestly and emphatically, “No man <span class= "ital">shall</span> make it void.” Perhaps, on the whole, especially having regard to the character of the writer, this last rendering is most likely to be the true one. In any case, the general drift and meaning of the passage is the same. The Apostle would rather die than lose his ground of boasting, and he boldly asserts his determination to let no one deprive him of it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void....">1 Corinthians 9:15-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">But </span>— Though my right to a maintenance, as an apostle, be established by the precepts both of the law and of the gospel; <span class="ital">I have used none of those things </span>— During my abode among you, as you well know; <span class="ital">neither have I written these things that </span>— If, according to my purpose, I should ever visit you again; <span class="ital">it should be so done unto me </span>— But only to teach you how to use your Christian liberty. <span class="ital">For it were better for me to die </span>— To suffer the greatest want, even to starving; <span class="ital">than that any man should make my glorying </span>— That I have preached the gospel freely; <span class="ital">void</span> — By drawing me to require a maintenance.

But when a minister gives up his right for the sake of the gospel, he does more than his charge and office demands. By preaching the gospel, freely, the apostle showed that he acted from principles of zeal and love, and thus enjoyed much comfort and hope in his soul. And though he looked on the ceremonial law as a yoke taken off by Christ, yet he submitted to it, that he might work upon the Jews, do away their prejudices, prevail with them to hear the gospel, and win them over to Christ. Though he would transgress no laws of Christ, to please any man, yet he would accommodate himself to all men, where he might do it lawfully, to gain some. Doing good was the study and business of his life; and, that he might reach this end, he did not stand on privileges. We must carefully watch against extremes, and against relying on any thing but trust in Christ alone. We must not allow errors or faults, so as to hurt others, or disgrace the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I have used none of these things - I have not urged and enforced this right. I have chosen to support myself by the labor of my own hands. This had been objected to him as a reason why he could not be an apostle.

Paul's special gift of continency, which enabled him to abstain from marriage, and his ability to maintain himself without interrupting seriously his ministry, made that expedient to him which is ordinarily inexpedient; namely, that the ministry should not be supported by the people.

Either none of these arguments or reasons, for a minister's maintenance, taken from the reason of things, the law of Moses, the examples of the priests and Levites, and the order and appointment of Christ, in favour of himself, and that he might be provided for by them accordingly; or none of the things he had a right to do as other apostles, as to eat and drink at the public expense, to lead about with him a sister, a wife, had he any, and to forbear working with his own hands: <p>neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me; it was not on his own account that he gave these strong reasons, urged these instances, and so undeniably proved this point, that ministers should be maintained by the people; and this he says to prevent what some might be ready enough to suggest, that though the apostle had as yet took nothing of the church at Corinth, it was plain, that for the time to come, he meant to do it; and therefore had written these things with such a view, to make way for his after supply from them. This he denies, and gives his reason for it, <p>for it were better for me to die; through want, with famine, could he be supplied no other way, than to take the least farthing of them: <p>or than that any man should make my glorying void; meaning not so much his inward pleasure, joy, and satisfaction in preaching the Gospel freely, it being more blessed to give than to receive; but his boasting or glorying, not before God, but against the false apostles; that he had never taken anything of the church at Corinth for preaching, nor never would, when they had insinuated he preached for gain, and by artful methods had got their money, and drained their purses. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I have used none of these things: <span class="cverse3">{10}</span> neither have I written these things, that it should be so done unto me: for <i>it were</i> better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.</span><p>(10) He takes away occasion of suspicion by the way, that it might not be thought that he wrote this as though he was demanding his wages that were not payed him. On the contrary, he says, I had rather die, than not to continue in this purpose to preach the Gospel freely. For I am bound to preach the Gospel, seeing that the Lord has given and commanded me this office: but unless I do it willingly and for the love of God, nothing that I do is to be considered worthwhile. If I had rather that the Gospel should be evil spoken of, than that I should not require my wages, then would it appear that I took these pains not so much for the Gospel's sake, as for my gains and advantages. But I say, this would not be to use, but rather to abuse my right and liberty: therefore not only in this thing, but also in all others (as much as I could) I am made all things to all men, that I might win them to Christ, and might together with them be won to Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/9.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐγὼ δέ</span>] Paul now reverts to the <span class="ital">individual</span> way of expressing himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="My answer to them that do examine me is this,">1 Corinthians 9:3</a>), effecting thereby a lively <span class="ital">climax</span> in the representation.

PAUL’S RENOUNCEMENT OF RIGHT FOR THE GOSPEL’S SAKE. The Ap. has been insisting all this time on the right of Christ’s ministers to material support from those they serve, in order that for his own part he may explicitly renounce it. This renunciation is his “boast,” and his “reward”; of his office he cannot boast, nor seek reward for it, since it was imposed upon him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void....">1 Corinthians 9:15-18</a>). In this abnegation P. finds his freedom, which he uses to make himself impartially the slave of all; untrammelled by any particular ties, he is able to adapt himself to every condition and class of men, and thus to win for the Gospel larger gains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more....">1 Corinthians 9:19-22</a>). For himself, his best hope is to partake in its salvation with those he strives to save (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-23.htm" title="And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.">1 Corinthians 9:23</a>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/9.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>15–23. St Paul’s use of his Christian liberty is restrained by the thought of the needs of others<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">But I have used none of these things</span>] Having disposed of the objections against his claims to Apostleship, he proceeds to the instance he had been intending to give of his voluntary abandonment of his rights as a Christian for the sake of others. Thus he vindicates his own consistency, shewing that the doctrine he laid down in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any.">1 Corinthians 6:12</a>, and which he again asserts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-19.htm" title="For though I be free from all men, yet have I made myself servant to all, that I might gain the more.">1 Corinthians 9:19</a> of this chapter, is a yoke which he not only imposes upon others, but willingly bears himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">than that any man should make my glorying void</span>] A remarkable inversion in the order of the Greek here has led some editors to prefer a different reading, which is found in some MSS., and which may be thus rendered: (1) It <span class="ital">were better for me to die than my ground of boasting—no one shall make</span> (<span class="ital">it</span>) <span class="ital">void</span>; or (2) It <span class="ital">were better for me to die than—no one shall make my ground of boasting void</span>. But the latter introduces an unfinished construction more harsh than is usual in St Paul’s Epistles. The word here translated <span class="ital">glorying</span> is translated in the next verse ‘a thing to glory of.’ See note on the same word in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good.

None of the forms of right which I might claim from these many sanctions. He is appealing to his own abandonment of a right to encourage them to waive, if need required, the claims of their Christian liberty. His object in waiving his plain right was that he might give no handle to any who might desire to accuse him of interested motives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-4.htm">1 Corinthians 9:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm">Galatians 6:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Have I written;</span> rather, <span class="accented">do I write</span>; the epistolary aorist. <span class="cmt_word">That it should be so done unto me.</span> Do not take my argument as a hint to you that you have neglected your duty of maintaining me, and have even seen me suffer without offering me your assistance. <span class="cmt_word">Better for me to die.</span> Not "to die of hunger," as Chrysostom supposes, but generally, "I should prefer death to the loss of my independence of attitude towards my converts." <span class="cmt_word">Than that any man should make my glorying void.</span> The Greek is remarkable.
