Where is thy sting, O hell?”—the word “hell” referring, not to the place of torment, but to the Hades of departed spirits. This difference between St. Paul’s words and those of the prophet has given rise to a variety of readings in the Greek text here. The weight of evidence is in favour of the reading, “Where is thy sting, O death? Where is thy victory, O death?” the word “Hades,” or “grave,” not being introduced at all. The passage is not a quotation, but the adaptation of the form of a familiar Old Testament phrase.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm" title="O death, where is your sting?

In the gospel, many truths, before hidden in mystery, are made known. Death never shall appear in the regions to which our Lord will bear his risen saints. Therefore let us seek the full assurance of faith and hope, that in the midst of pain, and in the prospect of death, we may think calmly on the horrors of the tomb; assured that our bodies will there sleep, and in the mean time our souls will be present with the Redeemer. Sin gives death all its hurtful power. The sting of death is sin; but Christ, by dying, has taken out this sting; he has made atonement for sin, he has obtained remission of it. The strength of sin is the law. None can answer its demands, endure its curse, or do away his own transgressions. Hence terror and anguish. And hence death is terrible to the unbelieving and the impenitent. Death may seize a believer, but it cannot hold him in its power. How many springs of joy to the saints, and of thanksgiving to God, are opened by the death and resurrection, the sufferings and conquests of the Redeemer! In verse 58, we have an exhortation, that believers should be stedfast, firm in the faith of that gospel which the apostle preached, and they received. Also, to be unmovable in their hope and expectation of this great privilege, of being raised incorruptible and immortal. And to abound in the work of the Lord, always doing the Lord's service, and obeying the Lord's commands. May Christ give us faith, and increase our faith, that we may not only be safe, but joyful and triumphant.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"O death." This triumphant exclamation is the commencement of the fourth division of the chapter, the practical consequences of the doctrine. It is such an exclamation as every man with right feelings will be disposed to make, who contemplates the ravages of death; who looks upon a world where in all forms he has reigned, and who then contemplates the glorious truth, that a complete and final triumph has been obtained over this great enemy of the happiness of man, and that man would die no more. It is a triumphant view which bursts upon the soul as it contemplates the fact that the work of the second Adam has repaired the ruins of the first, and that man is redeemed; his body will be raised; not another human being should die, and the work of death should be ended. Nay, it is more. Death is not only at an end; it shall not only cease, but its evils shall be repaired; and a glory and honor shall encompass the body of man, such as would have been unknown had there been no death. No commentary can add to the beauty and force of the language in this verse; and the best way to see its beauty, and to enjoy it, is to sit down and think of death; of what death has been, and has done; of the millions and millions that have died; of the earth strewn with the dead, and "arched with graves;" of our own death; the certainty that we must die, and our parents, and brothers, and sisters, and children, and friends; that all, all must die; and then to suffer the truth, in its full-orbed splendor, to rise upon us, that the time will come when death shall be at an end. Who, in such contemplation, can refrain from the language of triumph, and from hymns of praise?<p>Where is thy sting? - The word which is here rendered sting (&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  kentron) denotes properly a prick, a point, hence, a goad or stimulus; that is, a rod or staff with an iron point, for goading oxen; (see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-5.htm">Acts 9:5</a>); and then a sting properly, as of scorpions, bees, etc. It denotes here a venomous thing, or weapon, applied to death personified, as if death employed it to destroy life, as the sting of a bee or a scorpion is used. The idea is derived from the venomous sting of serpents, or other reptiles, as being destructive and painful. The language here is the language of exultation, as if that was taken away or destroyed.<p>O grave - &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#837;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;  hade&#772;. Hades, the place of the dead. It is not improperly rendered, however, grave. The word properly denotes a place of darkness; then the world, or abodes of the dead. According to the Hebrews, Hades, or Sheol, was a vast subterranean receptacle, or abode, where the souls of the dead existed. It was dark, deep, still, awful. The descent to it was through the grave; and the spirits of all the dead were supposed to be assembled there; the righteous occupying the upper regions, and the wicked the lower; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>; compare Lowth, Lectures on Hebrew Poetry, vii; Campbell, Prel. Diss. vi. part 2, 2. It refers here to the dead; and means that the grave, or Hades, should no longer have a victory.<p>Thy victory - Since the dead are to rise; since all the graves are to give up all that dwell in them; since no man will die after that, where is its victory? It is taken away. It is despoiled. The power of death and the grave is vanquished, and Christ is triumphant over all. It has been well remarked here, that the words in this verse rise above the plain and simple language of prose, and resemble a hymn, into which the apostle breaks out in view of the glorious truth which is here presented to the mind. The whole verse is indeed a somewhat loose quotation from <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, which we translate,<p>"O death, I will be thy plagues;<p>O grave, I will be thy destruction."<p>But which the Septuagint renders:<p>"O death, where is thy punishment?<p>O grave, where is thy sting?"<p>Probably Paul did not intend this as a direct quotation; but he spoke as a man naturally does who is familiar with the language of the Scriptures, and used it to express the sense which he intended, without meaning to make a direct and literal quotation. The form which Paul uses is so poetic in its structure that Pope has adopted it, with only a change in the location of the members, in the "Dying Christian:"<p>"O grave, where is thy victory?<p>O death, where is thy sting?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>55. Quoted from Ho 13:14, substantially; but freely used by the warrant of the Spirit by which Paul wrote. The Hebrew may be translated, "O death, where are thy plagues? Where, O Hades, is thy destruction?" The Septuagint, "Where is thy victory (literally, in a lawsuit), O death? Where is thy sting, O Hades? &#8230; Sting" answers to the Hebrew "plagues," namely, a poisoned sting causing plagues. Appropriate, as to the old serpent (Ge 3:14, 15; Nu 21:6). "Victory" answers to the Hebrew "destruction." Compare Isa 25:7, "destroy &#8230; veil &#8230; over all nations," namely, victoriously destroy it; and to "in victory" (1Co 15:54), which he triumphantly repeats. The "where" implies their past victorious destroying power and sting, now gone for ever; obtained through Satan's triumph over man in Eden, which enlisted God's law on the side of Satan and death against man (Ro 5:12, 17, 21). The souls in Hades being freed by the resurrection, death's sting and victory are gone. For "O grave," the oldest manuscripts and versions read, "O death," the second time.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle, in the contemplation of this blessed day, triumpheth over death, in a metaphorical phrase: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Where is thy sting?</span> What hurt canst thou now do unto believers, more than a wasp, or hornet, or bee, that hath lost its sting? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O grave, </span> or O hell, (the same word signifieth both), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">where</span> now <span class="bld">is thy victory?</span> The conqueror of all flesh is now conquered, the spoiler of all men is spoiled; it had got a victory, but now, O death, where is thy victory? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>O death, where is thy sting?....

Billroth, following Schoettgen, thinks of a <span class="ital">goad</span>, which death uses in order to cultivate its field. But this conception is not in the least recalled by the context. Olshausen, too, is wrong in holding that <span class="greekheb">τὸ κέντρον</span> denotes that which elicits the forthputting of strength: “<span class="ital">sin awakens the sleeping strength of death</span>, and <span class="ital">the law, again, that of sin</span>.” Then, plainly, <span class="greekheb">τὸ κέντρον τοῦ θανάτου</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-56.htm" title="The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.">1 Corinthians 15:56</a>, would be <span class="ital">that which stings death</span>, which is impossible according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm" title="O death, where is your sting?

According to the reading: <span class="greekheb">ποῦ σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">θάνατε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (see the critical remarks), the new element, which comes as a climax, is brought forward in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΝῖΚΟς</span></span></span> by way of addition, after a bold repetition of the same address; so that, putting aside the interrogative form, the meaning of the triumphant outburst is: <span class="ital">Thou death stingest no more</span>, for no one dies henceforth; <span class="ital">thou death hast lost the victory</span>, for the power of eternal life has won it over thee.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[100] So, rightly, Chrysostom and Theophylact.

But it is just the <span class="ital">boldness</span> of the flight of thought which is the most Pauline feature in our passage.
