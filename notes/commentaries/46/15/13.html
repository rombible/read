There had been no justification, or salvation, if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ be vain, and of no use, if he is still among the dead? The proof of the resurrection of the body is the resurrection of our Lord. Even those who died in the faith, had perished in their sins, if Christ had not risen. All who believe in Christ, have hope in him, as a Redeemer; hope for redemption and salvation by him; but if there is no resurrection, or future recompence, their hope in him can only be as to this life. And they must be in a worse condition than the rest of mankind, especially at the time, and under the circumstances, in which the apostles wrote; for then Christians were hated and persecuted by all men. But it is not so; they, of all men, enjoy solid comforts amidst all their difficulties and trials, even in the times of the sharpest persecution.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if there be no resurrection of the dead - If the whole subject is held to be impossible and absurd, then it must follow that Christ is not "risen," since there were the same difficulties in the way of raising him up which will exist in any case. He was dead and was buried. He had lain in the grave three days. His human soul had left the body. His frame had become cold and stiff. The blood had ceased to circulate, and the lungs to heave. In his case there was the same difficulty in raising him up to life that there is in any other; and if it is held to be impossible and absurd that the dead should rise, then it must follow that Christ has not been raised. This is the first consequence which Paul states as resulting from the denial of this doctrine, and this is inevitable. Paul thus shows them that the denial of the doctrine, or the maintaining the general proposition "that the dead would not rise," led also to the denial of the fact that the Lord Jesus had risen, and consequently to the denial of Christianity altogether, and the annihilation of all their hopes. There was, moreover, such a close connection between Christ and his people, that the resurrection of the Lord Jesus made their resurrection certain. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. If there be no general resurrection, which is the consequent, then there can have been no resurrection of Christ, which is the antecedent. The head and the members of the body stand on the same footing: what does not hold good of them, does not hold good of Him either: His resurrection and theirs are inseparably joined (compare 1Co 15:20-22; Joh 14:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If</span> (saith the apostle) <span class="bld">there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen.</span> But some will possibly say: How doth this follow? Suppose it true, that Christ be risen, how doth it follow, that the dead shall rise? The force of it lieth in several things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Christ, as he saith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1 Corinthians 15:20</a></span>, is <span class="ital">the first-fruits of them that slept, </span> the exemplary cause of our resurrection. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. If we consider Christ as the Head, it is unreasonable, that the Head should be risen from the dead, and the members yet held of death, when it is the office of the Head to communicate sense, life, and motion to the members. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, the argument is strong from the consideration of the end of Christ’s resurrection, which was to show his victory over death, that the dead might hear his voice and live, and that he might be the Judge of the quick and the dead (which he could not have been, if the dead did not rise). Now though it be true, that Christ’s headship to his church, and the apostle’s argument from thence, will not prove the resurrection of the wicked, yet, (besides that the resurrection of believers is the main thing the apostle here proveth, having elsewhere abundantly proved the general resurrection), the consideration here of Christ’s being raised, that he might be the Judge both of the quick and of the dead, will prove the resurrection of the wicked, as well as of believers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if there be no resurrection of the dead,.... If there is no such thing as a resurrection of any, if the thing is not possible, if it never has been, is, or will be true in fact: <p>then is Christ not risen. The apostle argues from a general, to a particular; from the general resurrection of the dead, to the particular resurrection of Christ; and from a negation of the one, to a negation of the other; for what does not agree with the whole, does not agree with the part; and what is true of the whole, is true of the part; but if the resurrection of Christ is not true, many are the absurdities that must follow upon it, and which the apostle next enumerates. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</span><p>(4) The second by an absurdity: if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ is not risen again.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm" title="But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:">1 Corinthians 15:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] carrying onward, in order by a chain of inferences to reduce the <span class="greekheb">τινές</span> with their assertion <span class="ital">ad absurdum</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὐδέ</span>] <span class="ital">even not</span>.

There were some, moreover (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;...">2 Timothy 2:17-18</a>), who perverted St Paul’s teaching (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-6.htm" title="And has raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus:">Ephesians 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-2.htm" title=" That their hearts might be comforted, being knit together in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God, and of the Father, and of Christ;">Colossians 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-13.htm" title=" And you, being dead in your sins and the uncircumcision of your flesh, has he quickened together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses;">Colossians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God.">Colossians 3:1</a>) into the doctrine that the resurrection taught by the Apostles of Jesus was the spiritual awakening from sin to righteousness, the quickening of moral and spiritual energies into activity and predominance. The fact would seem to be that St Paul so contrived his argument as to deal with all antagonists at once. The whole question whether there were a future life or not, according to him, depended on the fact of Christ’s Resurrection. If He were risen, then a resurrection of all mankind was not probable, but certain. If He were not risen, then there was not only no resurrection, but no immortality, no future life at all (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2 Timothy 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-14.htm" title="For as much then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil;">Hebrews 2:14</a>, as well as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit....">1 Corinthians 15:45-49</a></span> of this chapter).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then is Christ not risen</span>] If a resurrection from the dead be impossible, the principle embraces the Resurrection of Christ Himself, which, if this postulate be granted, becomes at once either a mistake or an imposture. And since, on the Apostle’s principles, there is no hope of a future life but through Him, we are driven to the conclusion—a <span class="ital">reductio ad absurdum</span>—that “the answer to His prayer ‘Father, into Thy hands I commend My spirit,’ was Annihilation! that He Who had made His life one perpetual act of consecration to His Father’s service received for His reward the same fate as attended the blaspheming malefactor.” Robertson. And we must infer also, he continues, that as the true disciples of Christ in all ages have led purer, humbler, more self-sacrificing lives than other men, they have attained to this higher excellence by “believing what was false,” and that therefore men become more “pure and noble” by believing what is false than by believing what is true.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-13.htm" title="But if there be no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:">1 Corinthians 15:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰ δὲ</span>, <span class="ital">but if</span>) He now begins a retrospect, and enumerates all that he alleged at 3–11.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then is Christ not risen.</span> If the possibility of a resurrection be <span class="accented">generically</span> denied, it cannot in any instance be true.
