The Rabbinical explanation of that passage was—that God breathed into man the breath of life originally, but that man became (not “was made”) only a living soul, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> one in whom the mere human faculties held sway, and not the spirit. He became this lower thing by his own act of disobedience. Here, then, St. Paul, contrasts the two Adams—the first man and Christ—from whom we derive our natural and our spiritual natures, and our natural and spiritual bodies. The first Adam became, by his disobedience, a mere living soul, and from him we inherit that nature; the second Adam, by his obedience, became a life-giving spirit, and from Him we inherit the spiritual nature in us. The same verb which is expressed in the first clause must be understood in the second clause. The same thought is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-19.htm" title="For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.">Romans 5:19</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit....">1 Corinthians 15:45-46</a></span>. <span class="ital">And so it is written </span>— With respect to the animal body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>. <span class="ital">The first Adam was made a living soul </span>— God gave him animal life, in many respects resembling that of other animals; <span class="ital">the last Adam was made </span>— Rather <span class="ital">was, </span>or <span class="ital">is, </span>for there is nothing in the original for <span class="ital">made; a quickening Spirit </span>— Having life in himself, and quickening whom he will: imparting even a more refined life to men’s bodies at the resurrection, than that which they formerly possessed.

Here we are taught that the plan of the divine government is to lead his creatures from a lower to a higher state of perfection. They, therefore, who contend that things should be as perfect at the beginning as at the conclusion of his administration, are wiser than God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:35-50 1. How are the dead raised up? that is, by what means? How can they be raised? 2. As to the bodies which shall rise. Will it be with the like shape, and form, and stature, and members, and qualities? The former objection is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter of curious doubters. To the first the answer is, This was to be brought about by Divine power; that power which all may see does somewhat like it, year after year, in the death and revival of the corn. It is foolish to question the Almighty power of God to raise the dead, when we see it every day quickening and reviving things that are dead. To the second inquiry; The grain undergoes a great change; and so will the dead, when they rise and live again. The seed dies, though a part of it springs into new life, though how it is we cannot fully understand. The works of creation and providence daily teach us to be humble, as well as to admire the Creator's wisdom and goodness. There is a great variety among other bodies, as there is among plants. There is a variety of glory among heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly state; and there will be a variety of glories among them. Burying the dead, is like committing seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again. Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body. But believers shall at the resurrection have bodies, made fit to be for ever united with spirits made perfect. To God all things are possible. He is the Author and Source of spiritual life and holiness, unto all his people, by the supply of his Holy Spirit to the soul; and he will also quicken and change the body by his Spirit. The dead in Christ shall not only rise, but shall rise thus gloriously changed. The bodies of the saints, when they rise again, will be changed. They will be then glorious and spiritual bodies, fitted to the heavenly world and state, where they are ever afterwards to dwell. The human body in its present form, and with its wants and weaknesses, cannot enter or enjoy the kingdom of God. Then let us not sow to the flesh, of which we can only reap corruption. And the body follows the state of the soul. He, therefore, who neglects the life of the soul, casts away his present good; he who refuses to live to God, squanders all he has.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And so it is written, - <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>. It is only the first part of the verse which is quoted.<p>The first man Adam was made a living soul - This is quoted exactly from the translation by the Septuagint, except that the apostle has added the words "first" and "Adam." This is done to designate whom he meant. The meaning of the phrase "was made a living soul" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  egeneto eis psuche&#772;n zo&#772;san - in Hebrew, &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1497;&#1492;  nephesh chayaah is, became a living, animated being; a being endowed with life. The use of the word "soul" in our translation, for &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b7;&#768;  psuche&#772;, and &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;  nephesh, does not quite convey the idea. We apply the word "soul," usually, to the intelligent and the immortal part of man; that which reasons, thinks, remembers, is conscious, is responsible, etc. The Greek and Hebrew words, however, more properly denote that which is alive, which is animated, which breathes, which has an animal nature, see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>. And this is precisely the idea which Paul uses here, that the first man was made an animated being by having breathed into him the breath of life <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>, and that it is the image of this animated or vital being which we bear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-48.htm">1 Corinthians 15:48</a>. Neither Moses nor Paul deny that in addition to this, man was endowed with a rational soul, an immortal nature; but that is not the idea which they present in the passage in Genesis which Paul quotes.<p>The last Adam - The second Adam, or the "second man," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>. That Christ is here intended is apparent, and has been usually admitted by commentators. Christ here seems to be called Adam because he stands in contradistinction from the first Adam; or because, as we derive our animal and dying nature from the one, so we derive our immortal and undying bodies from the other. From the one we derive an animal or vital existence; from the other we derive our immortal existence, and resurrection from the grave. The one stands at the head of all those who have an existence represented by the words, "a living soul;" the other of all those who shall have a spiritual body in heaven. He is called "the last Adam;" meaning that there shall be no other after him who shall affect the destiny of man in the same way, or who shall stand at the head of the race in a manner similar to what had been done by him and the first father of the human family. They sustain special relations to the race; and in this respect they were "the first" and "the last" in the special economy. The name "Adam" is not elsewhere given to the Messiah, though a comparison is several times instituted between him and Adam. (See the Supplementary Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-22.htm">1 Corinthians 15:22</a>; also <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>, note.)<p>A quickening spirit - (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;  eis pneuma zo&#772;opoioun. A vivifying spirit; a spirit giving or imparting life. Not a being having mere vital functions, or an animated nature, but a being who has the power of imparting life. This is not a quotation from any part of the Scriptures, but seems to be used by Paul either as affirming what was true on his own apostolic authority, or as conveying the substance of what was revealed respecting the Messiah in the Old Testament. There may be also reference to what the Saviour himself taught, that he was the source of life; that he had the power of imparting life, and that he gave life to all whom he pleased: see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-4.htm">John 1:4</a>; note at <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>, "For as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself." <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-21.htm">1 Corinthians 15:21</a>, "for as the Father raiseth up the dead, and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom he will."<p>The word "spirit," here applied to Christ, is in contradistinction from "a living being," as applied to Adam, and seems to be used in the sense of spirit of life, as raising the bodies of his people from the dead, and imparting life to them. He was constituted not as having life merely, but as endowed with the power of imparting life; as endowed with that spiritual or vital energy which was needful to impart life. All life is the creation or production of "spirit" (&#x3a0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  Pneuma); as applied to God the Father, or the Son, or the Holy Spirit. Spirit is the source of all vitality. God is a spirit, and God is the source of all life. And the idea here is, that Christ had such a spiritual existence such power as a spirit; that he was the source of all life to his people. The word "spirit" is applied to his exalted spiritual nature, in distinction from his human nature, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-4.htm">Romans 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. The apostle does not here affirm that he had not a human nature, or a vital existence as a man; but that his main characteristic in contradistinction from Adam was, that he was endowed with an elevated spiritual nature, which was capable of imparting vital existence to the dead. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>45. so&#8212;in accordance with the distinction just mentioned between the natural or animal-souled body and the spiritual body.<p>it is written&#8212;(Ge 2:7); "Man became (was made to become) a living soul," that is, endowed with an animal soul, the living principle of his body.<p>the last Adam&#8212;the LAST Head of humanity, who is to be fully manifested in the last day, which is His day (Joh 6:39). He is so called in Job 19:25; see on [2295]Job 19:25 (compare Ro 5:14). In contrast to "the last," Paul calls "man" (Ge 2:7) "the FIRST Adam."<p>quickening&#8212;not only living, but making alive (Joh 5:21; 6:33, 39, 40, 54, 57, 62, 63; Ro 8:11). As the natural or animal-souled body (1Co 15:44) is the fruit of our union with the first Adam, an animal-souled man, so the spiritual body is the fruit of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening Spirit (2Co 3:17). As He became representative of the whole of humanity in His union of the two natures, He exhausted in His own person the sentence of death passed on all men, and giveth spiritual and everlasting life to whom He will.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The first part is written in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a></span>, God <span class="ital">breathed into man’s nostrils the breath of life, and</span> so he <span class="ital">became a living soul; </span> that is, a living substance, living an animal, natural life, by virtue of that breath of life which God breathed into him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The last Adam, </span> by which he meaneth Christ, who in time was after the first Adam, and was born in the last days, and was the last common Head; as Adam was the first, with respect of natural and carnal propagation, so Christ was the last Head, in respect of grace and spiritual regeneration, he <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">was made a quickening spirit:</span> He was <span class="ital">made</span> so, not when he was conceived and born, for he had a body subject to the same natural infirmities that ours are; but upon his resurrection from the dead, when, though he had the same body, in respect of the substance of it, yet it differed in qualities, and was much more spiritual; with which body he ascended up into heaven, clothed with a power, as to quicken souls with a spiritual life, so also to quicken our mortal bodies at his second coming, when he shall raise the dead out of their graves. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And so it is written,.... In <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a><p>the first man Adam was made a living soul: in the Hebrew text it is, man, or Adam, became, or was made a living soul; that is, as the apostle says, "the first man Adam": he calls him, as the Jews (a) frequently do, , "the first man"; he was the first man that was made, and the first parent of mankind, and the head and representative of all his posterity, and so the first in time, causality and dignity; whose name was Adam, so called by God in the day he was created, because he was formed , "from the ground, or earth"; when God breathed life into the earthly mass, or lump; and being animated with a rational soul, it became an animal body, or a living creature; and so the apostle proves, from the first man that was upon earth, that there is a natural, or animal body; a body animated by a soul, and which was supported by eating and drinking, by sleep and rest; and was capable of dying, and should die, in case of sin; and which was the state of it in its first creation, whilst in innocence, and before the fall; and this is all he meant to prove by this Scripture; for what follows is not mentioned as therein written, or elsewhere, but as the apostle's own assertion: <p>the last Adam was made a quickening spirit: by "the last Adam" is meant Jesus Christ, called Adam, because he is really and truly a man, a partaker of the same flesh and blood as the rest of mankind; and because he is the antitype of the first man Adam, who was a figure of him that was to come; and therefore called Adam, for the same reason as he is called David and Solomon: he is said to be "the last", in distinction from the first Adam, with respect to him he stood,  last upon the earth, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-25.htm">Job 19:25</a> to which passage some think the apostle here alludes; and because he appeared in the last days in the end of the world, and is the last that shall rise up as a common head and representative of the whole, or any part of mankind: now he is made "a quickening spirit"; which some understand of the Holy Spirit, which filled the human nature of Christ, raised him from the dead, and will quicken our mortal bodies at the last day; others of the divine nature of Christ, to which his flesh, or human nature, was united; and which gave life, rigour, and virtue, to all his actions and sufferings, as man; and by which he was quickened, when put to death in the flesh, and by which he will quicken others another day: though rather I think it is to be understood of his spiritual body, of his body, not as it was made of the virgin, for that was a natural, or an animal one; it was conceived and bred, and born as animal bodies are; it grew and increased, and was nourished with meat and drink, and sleep and rest; and was subject to infirmities, and to death itself, as our bodies be; but it is to be understood of it as raised from the dead, when it was made a spiritual body, for which reason it is called a "spirit": not that it was changed into a spirit, for it still remained flesh and blood; but because it was no more supported in an animal way; nor subject to those weaknesses that animal bodies are, but lives as spirits, or angels do; and a quickening one, not only because it has life itself, but because by virtue of the saints' union to it, as it subsists in the divine person of the Son of God, their bodies will be quickened at the last day, and made like unto it, spiritual bodies; also because he lives in his body as a spiritual one, they shall live in theirs as spiritual ones: and so the apostle shows, that there is a spiritual, as well as an animal body; that as the first man's body, even before the fall, was an animal or natural one; the last Adam's body upon his resurrection is a spiritual and life giving one, as the Syriac version renders it; so the Cabalistic writers (b) speak of <p>"Adam; who is the holy and supreme, who rules over all, and gives spirit and life to all.'' <p>(a) T.

He joins on these words of his own, however, <span class="ital">immediately</span> to the passage of Scripture, in order to indicate that the <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔσχατος</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζωοποιοῦν</span> follows as necessarily from it according to its typical reference, as if the words had been expressed along with it.[80] He thus gives <span class="ital">expression</span> to the inference which is <span class="ital">tacitly</span> contained in the statement, by adding forthwith this self-evident conclusion as if belonging also to the passage of Scripture, because posited for it by the inner necessity of the antithesis. When others, such as Billroth and Rückert, assume that <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔσχατος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is meant really to be a part of the Scripture-quotation, they in that case charge the apostle with having made the half of the citation himself and given it out as being Bible words; but assuredly no instance is to be found of such an arbitrary procedure, however freely he handles passages from the Old Testament elsewhere. And would the <span class="ital">readers</span>, seeing that <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζῶσαν</span> is <span class="ital">such a universally known</span> statement, have been able to recognise in <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔσχατος κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Bible words? According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ γέγρ</span>. is a completed sentence, which only states that the distinction between two kinds of human body is scriptural. In order to demonstrate this scripturalness the apostle then <span class="ital">applies</span> the passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>.

We use the word <span class="ital">lively</span> in a similar manner. The word is really kindred to the Latin <span class="ital">vivus</span> and the French <span class="ital">vie</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γέγραπται</span>, <span class="ital">it is written</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm" title="And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul.">Genesis 2:7</a>, LXX., <span class="greekheb">ἐγένετο ὁ ἄνθρωπος εἰς ψυχὴν ζῶσαν</span>, <span class="ital">man became a living soul</span>.
