The argument is still purely an appeal to historical evidence supporting an historical fact, and to the consequences involved in denying that fact (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-16.htm" title="For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:">1Corinthians 15:16</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-14.htm" title="And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain....">1 Corinthians 15:14-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then is our preaching </span>— In consequence of a commission supposed to be given after his resurrection; <span class="ital">vain </span>— Without any real foundation, and destitute of truth; <span class="ital">and your faith </span>— In our preaching; <span class="ital">is vain </span>— Is grounded on falsehood and deception; <span class="ital">yea, and we are false witnesses of God </span>— Having testified that Jesus of Nazareth is his Son and the Messiah; that he hath atoned for sin; hath risen from the dead and ascended into heaven; hath obtained for his followers the Holy Spirit in his gifts and graces; a resurrection from the dead, and eternal life; and is constituted the final Judge of men and angels; — all which things, depending on his resurrection, are absolutely false, if he be not risen; and, of consequence, <span class="ital">ye are yet in your sins </span>— Unpardoned and unrenewed, without either a title to heaven or a meetness for it. So that there needed something more than reformation, (which was plainly wrought in them,) in order to their being delivered from the guilt of sin, and renewed after the divine image; even that atonement, the sufficiency of which God attested by raising our great Surety from the grave, and the influences of the Divine Spirit procured for us by that atonement. <span class="ital">Then they who are fallen asleep in Christ </span>— Who have died for him, or believing in him; <span class="ital">are perished </span>— Have lost their life and being together. This sentence shows, that in this discourse the apostle has the resurrection of the just principally in view, and that what he hath written concerning the excellent qualities of the bodies to be raised, is to be understood of the bodies of the saints only.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:12-19 Having shown that Christ was risen, the apostle answers those who said there would be no resurrection. There had been no justification, or salvation, if Christ had not risen. And must not faith in Christ be vain, and of no use, if he is still among the dead? The proof of the resurrection of the body is the resurrection of our Lord. Even those who died in the faith, had perished in their sins, if Christ had not risen. All who believe in Christ, have hope in him, as a Redeemer; hope for redemption and salvation by him; but if there is no resurrection, or future recompence, their hope in him can only be as to this life. And they must be in a worse condition than the rest of mankind, especially at the time, and under the circumstances, in which the apostles wrote; for then Christians were hated and persecuted by all men. But it is not so; they, of all men, enjoy solid comforts amidst all their difficulties and trials, even in the times of the sharpest persecution.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And if Christ is not risen, then is our preaching vain - Another consequence which must follow if it be held that there was no resurrection, and consequently that Christ was not risen. it would be vain and useless to preach. The substance of their preaching was that Christ was raised up; and all their preaching was based on that. If that were not true, the whole system was false, and Christianity was an imposition. The word vain here seems to include the idea of useless, idle, false. It would be "false" to affirm that the Christian system was from heaven; it would be useless to proclaim such a system, since it could save no one.<p>And your faith is also vain - It is useless to believe. It can be of no advantage. If Christ was not raised, he was an impostor, since he repeatedly declared that he would rise <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-21.htm">Matthew 16:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-22.htm">Matthew 18:22-23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-22.htm">Luke 9:22</a>, and since the whole of his religion depended on that. The system could not be true unless Christ had been raised, as he said he would be; and to believe a false system could be of no use to any man. The argument here is one addressed to all their feelings, their hopes, and their belief. It is drawn from all their convictions that the system was true. Were they, could they be prepared to admit a doctrine which involved the consequence that all the evidences which they had that the apostles preached the truth were delusive, and that all the evidences of the truth of Christianity which had affected their minds and won their hearts were false and deceptive? If they were not prepared for this, then it followed that they should not abandon or doubt the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. your faith &#8230; vain&#8212;(1Co 15:11). The Greek for "vain" here is, empty, unreal: in 1Co 15:17, on the other hand, it is, without use, frustrated. The principal argument of the first preachers in support of Christianity was that God had raised Christ from the dead (Ac 1:22; 2:32; 4:10, 33; 13:37; Ro 1:4). If this fact were false, the faith built on it must be false too.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Now, (saith the apostle), if Christ be not raised, in what a case are you!

Our preaching is vain and false, and your faith is so also, for the object of it faileth, which is a Christ risen from the dead. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if Christ be not risen,.... If this is a truth, and must be taken as granted, as it must be, if there is no resurrection at all: <p>then is our preaching vain; false, empty, delusory, unprofitable, and useless; not only that part of it which more especially concerns the resurrection of Christ, but even the whole of it; preaching Christ as the Son of God, which was the subject of the apostle's ministry, and which he set out with, is to no purpose, if he is not risen; for one considerable proof of his sonship depends upon his resurrection, which is the declaration of it; for who can believe him to be the Son of God, if he is detained under the power of the grave? one reason why he could not be held of death, and the pains and cords of it, any longer than was necessary, and was his pleasure, was because he was the Son of God, as well as surety of his people, who had paid the whole debt: so the preaching of his incarnation, obedience, sufferings, and death, is of no use and avail, if he has not abolished death, and brought life and immortality to light, first in himself, and then for his people: <p>and your faith is also vain; either the grace of faith, by which they believed on Christ, or the doctrine of faith; or since this is repeated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-17.htm">1 Corinthians 15:17</a> the one may be meant here, and the other there. The doctrine of faith they had given their assent to, not only respecting the resurrection of Christ, but any other truth relating to his person and office, must be vain and empty, and without any foundation; even that faith which is one, uniform, harmonious, and consistent, which was once delivered to the saints; which they are to stand fast in, to strive, contend, and fight for, and not part with at any rate, upon any account whatever; and yet this, and the preaching and belief of it, are useless and insignificant things, if Christ is not risen; such wretched absurdities must follow upon the denial of that truth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> And if Christ be not risen, then <i>is</i> our preaching vain, and your faith <i>is</i> also vain.</span><p>(5) The proof of that absurdity, by other absurdities: if Christ is not risen again, the preaching of the Gospel is in vain, and the credit that you gave to it is vain, and we are liars.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm" title="And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.">1 Corinthians 15:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] continues the series of inferences.
