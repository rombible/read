The occasion which caused the Apostle to dwell at such length and with such emphasis on this subject was the denial of the resurrection by some members of the Corinthian Church. It has been suggested by some writers that what the Apostle had to combat was a false conception of the resurrection—that at Corinth there were probably those who refined away the doctrine of the resurrection into merely a rising from the death of sin into a life of righteousness, something after the manner of Hymenæus and Philetus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-17.htm" title="And their word will eat as does a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus;">2Timothy 2:17-18</a>), who taught that “the resurrection was past already.” It seems clear, however, from the emphatic statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-12.htm" title="Now if Christ be preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?">1Corinthians 15:12</a>, and from the general scope and drift of the entire argument, that what the Apostle is here meeting is not a perversion, but a denial of the doctrine. There were many elements in such a mixed body as the Corinthian Church which would have contributed to the growth of this error. Amongst the Jewish converts would be some traces of the Sadducean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-23.htm" title="The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there is no resurrection, and asked him,">Matthew 22:23</a>) denial of the resurrection, and in the Gentile section of the Church there would linger the spirit of the Athenians who “mocked when they heard of the resurrection of the dead” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-32.htm" title="And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear you again of this matter.">Acts 17:32</a>), and of the Epicurean philosophers who said, “Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.” From these and from other like sources there had crept into the Church itself a denial of the doctrine of the resurrection. In reading this chapter it is well to remember that the Apostle probably intended it, not only as a reply to these corruptors of the faith, but as supplying those who remained faithful with a confirmation of their own faith, and arguments with which they might meet their opponents. It is always difficult to give a clear, exhaustive analysis of an argument by such a writer as St. Paul. The enthusiasm of his nature leads him to mingle the syllogism of passion with the syllogism of logic; and, as he was not writing himself, but dictating the composition, a word often leads him off from his argument into some splendid outburst of pathetic exhortation, or of prophetic utterance. Still, including such digressions, the general argument of this chapter may be tabulated thus:—<p>I.—THE DOCTRINE OF THE RESURRECTION (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1-34</a>).<p>Subdivided as follows:<p>(1) <span class= "ital">The resurrection proved by the historical fact of Christ’s resurrection</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;">1Corinthians 15:1-15</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "ital">The resurrection proved by an appeal to the moral consequences involved in a</span> <span class= "ital">denial of it</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-16.htm" title="For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:">1Corinthians 15:16-28</a>).<p>(3) <span class= "ital">The truth of the resurrection involved in certain existing practices</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-29.htm" title="Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?">1Corinthians 15:29-34</a>).<p>II.—THE METHOD AND PRINCIPLE OF THE RESURRECTION (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35-58</a>).<p>(1) <span class= "ital">Illustration from analogy</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?">1Corinthians 15:35-44</a>).<p>(2) <span class= "ital">Illustration from our dual descent from.

It is the original gospel which he had preached to them, which they received, and in which they stand, and by which they <span class= "ital">are being saved</span> (not “are saved,” as in the English).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;...">1 Corinthians 15:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Moreover, brethren </span>— The resurrection of the body being one of the great objects of the faith and hope of Christians, the apostle in this chapter sets before the Corinthians, and all mankind, the proof by which that joyful event is rendered indubitable, namely, that it is a necessary consequence of the resurrection of Christ. Wherefore, to lay a firm foundation for this proof, he judged it proper to recall to the remembrance of the Corinthians the arguments by which he had proved to their satisfaction the truth of Christ’s resurrection, which is the subject that he first touches upon. <span class="ital">I declare — </span><span class="greekheb">Γνωριζω</span>, <span class="ital">I make known; the gospel </span>— The principal doctrines thereof; <span class="ital">which I preached unto you </span>— At the very beginning of my ministry among you; <span class="ital">which also you received </span>— In faith and love; <span class="ital">and wherein you stand </span>— In the faith of which many of you persevere; <span class="ital">by which also ye are </span>— Or shall be; <span class="ital">saved </span>finally, <span class="ital">if ye keep in memory — </span><span class="greekheb">Ει κατεχετε</span>, <span class="ital">if ye hold fast; what I preached unto you </span>— The great truths to which I bore testimony: that is, your salvation is begun, and will be perfected if ye continue in the faith; <span class="ital">unless ye have believed in vain</span> — Or rather, <span class="ital">rashly, </span>as <span class="greekheb">εικη </span>seems evidently here to signify, denoting the disposition of those who do a thing by chance and lightly, without knowing for what reason or end they do it. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-11 The word resurrection, usually points out our existence beyond the grave. Of the apostle's doctrine not a trace can be found in all the teaching of philosophers. The doctrine of Christ's death and resurrection, is the foundation of Christianity. Remove this, and all our hopes for eternity sink at once. And it is by holding this truth firm, that Christians stand in the day of trial, and are kept faithful to God. We believe in vain, unless we keep in the faith of the gospel. This truth is confirmed by Old Testament prophecies; and many saw Christ after he was risen. This apostle was highly favoured, but he always had a low opinion of himself, and expressed it. When sinners are, by Divine grace, turned into saints, God causes the remembrance of former sins to make them humble, diligent, and faithful. He ascribes to Divine grace all that was valuable in him. True believers, though not ignorant of what the Lord has done for, in, and by them, yet when they look at their whole conduct and their obligations, they are led to feel that none are so worthless as they are. All true Christians believe that Jesus Christ, and him crucified, and then risen from the dead, is the sun and substance of Christianity. All the apostles agreed in this testimony; by this faith they lived, and in this faith they died.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Moreover - But (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;  de).

Here it does not mean that he was communicating to them any new truth, but he wished to remind them of it; to state the arguments for it, and to impress it deeply on their memories. There is an abruptness in our translation which does not exist in the original. Bloomfield.<p>The gospel - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-1.htm">Mark 1:1</a>. The word here means the "glad announcement," or the "good news" about the coming of the Messiah, his life, and sufferings, and death, and especially his resurrection. The main subject to which Paul refers in this chapter is the resurrection, but he includes in the word gospel. Here, the doctrine that he died for sins, and was buried, as well as the doctrine of his resurrection; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm">1 Corinthians 15:3-4</a>.<p>Which I preached unto you - Paul founded the church at Corinth; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-1.htm">Acts 18:1</a> ff. It was proper that he should remind them of what he had taught them at first; of the great elementary truths on which the church had been established, but from which their minds had been diverted by the other subjects that had been introduced as matters of debate and strife. It was fair to presume that they would regard with respect the doctrines which the founder of their church had first proclaimed, if they were reminded of them; and Paul, therefore, calls their attention to the great and vital truths by which they had been converted, and by which the church had thus far prospered. It is well, often, to remind Christians of the truths which were preached to them when they were converted, and which were instrumental in their conversion. When they have gone off from these doctrines, when they had given their minds to speculation and philosophy, it has a good effect to "remind" them that they were converted by the simple truths, that Christ died, and was buried, and rose again from the dead. The argument of Paul here is, that they owed all the piety and comfort which they had to these doctrines; and that, therefore, they should still adhere to them as the foundation of all their hopes.<p>Which also ye have received - Which you embraced; which you all admitted as true; which were the means of your conversion. I would remind you, that, however that truth may now be denied by you, it was once received by you, and you professed to believe in the fact that Christ rose from the dead, and that the saints would rise.<p>And wherein ye stand - By which your church was founded, and by which all your piety and hope has been produced, and which is at the foundation of all your religion. You were built up by this, and by this only can you stand as a Christian church. This doctrine was vital and fundamental. This demonstrates that the doctrines that Christ died "for sins," and rose from the dead, are fundamental truths of Christianity. They enter into its very nature; and without them there can be no true religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 15<p>1Co 15:1-58.

The resurrection of the body in the last day is an article of faith, to the firm belief of which reason speaketh not sufficiently, and therefore it was denied by many philosophers and worldly wise men, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm" title="Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoicks, encountered him.

It should seem, that some in the church of Corinth had sucked in some of their notions; the apostle, therefore, in this chapter setteth himself to confirm that article of the Christian faith. To this purpose he begins, telling them, that that which he declared unto them was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the gospel, </span> that is, that doctrine of the gospel which he had before preached to them, and which they had heard, and believed, and embraced as the truth of God, and wherein the greatest part yet stood firm to their former profession, though some of them had been seduced and warped. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Moreover brethren, I declare unto you the Gospel,.... The apostle here passes on, and proceeds to a new subject, the doctrine of the resurrection of the dead, which some in this church denied; and which he undertakes to prove, establish, and defend; and in order to lead on to it, observes, that what he was about to declare, make known, or put them in mind of, was no other than the Gospel he had formerly preached to them, they had received, professed to stand in, and were saved by, unless their faith was in vain. The doctrine of the resurrection of the dead he calls "the Gospel", that being a most important doctrine, and a fundamental article of it. The resurrection of Christ from the dead made a considerable part in the ministry of the apostles, to the grief of the Sadducees among the Jews, to the scorn of the Gentile philosophers, and to the faith, hope, and comfort of Christians: this is the sum and substance of the word of faith, or doctrine of the Gospel, upon which the whole depends; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm">Romans 10:8</a> and the resurrection of the saints is connected with it, and assured by it. This indeed is the Gospel, good news, glad tidings that the bodies of the saints shall be raised again, and made like to the glorious body of Christ; and being reunited to their souls, shall live with him to all eternity; and were this out of the Gospel, it would not be Gospel, or good news; it would be an idle story, faith would be a vain thing, and hoping and believing Christians of all the most miserable. Moreover, says the apostle, the Gospel I declare, is <p>which I preached unto you; meaning, when he first came among them, and which had been so very useful to them for conversion and consolation; and therefore if he himself, or an angel from heaven, was to preach any other doctrine, it was to be rejected; and hence, much less should the false teachers be regarded: yea, adds he, it is the doctrine <p>which also you have received; when first enlightened and converted, with all gladness and joyfulness, with all readiness and cheerfulness, in the love of it, and by a full assent to it; and therefore having had such an experience of it, should not now depart from it: nay, he further says, <p>and wherein ye stand; as he hoped they did, at least it was what they ought to have done, and doubtless was the case of the majority of them, and whose example it became the rest to follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover, <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> stand;</span><p>(1) The sixth treatise of this epistle, concerning the resurrection: and he uses a transition, or passing over from one matter to another, showing first that he brings no new thing, to the end that the Corinthians might understand that they had begun to swerve from the right course. And next that he does not go about to entreat of a trifling matter, but of another chief point of the Gospel, which if it is taken away, their faith will necessarily come to nothing. And so at the length he begins this treatise at Christ's resurrection, which is the ground and foundation of ours, and confirms it first by the testimony of the scriptures and by the witness of the apostles, and of more than five hundred brethren, and last of all by his own.<p>(a) In the profession of which you still continue.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you have received, and wherein you stand;...">1 Corinthians 15:1-2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] forming the transition to a new subject.

Not without design does he add this condition to the <span class="greekheb">σώζεσθε</span>; for his readers were threatened with the danger of being led by the deniers of the resurrection to become untrue to the specific contents of his preaching. Others (including Bengel, Heydenreich, Billroth, van Hengel, Ewald) regard <span class="greekheb">τίνι λόγῳ εὐηγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. as a more precise definition to <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ εὐηγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. in accordance with the common form of attraction <span class="greekheb">οἶδά σε τίς εἶ</span> (Winer, p. 581 [E. T. 781]). Against this, however, it may be urged: (1) that the meaning: “<span class="ital">I make known to you … if you still hold it fast</span>,” contains in the latter half (which is not to be transmuted, with van Hengel, into the sense: “<span class="ital">si curae nobis cordique est quod nunc dico</span>”) a condition which stands in no logical relation to the first half; (2) that <span class="greekheb">εἰ κατέχετε</span> would be at variance with <span class="greekheb">ἐν ᾧ καὶ ἑστήκατε</span>; (3) that we should then have to assume for <span class="greekheb">ἐκτὸς εἰ μὴ εἰκῆ ἐπιστ</span>. the inadmissible (see below) reference to <span class="greekheb">κατέχετε</span>. All these difficulties fall away with the above interpretation, according to which <span class="greekheb">παρελάβετε</span> expresses the historical act of reception; <span class="greekheb">ἑστήκατε</span>, the present faithfulness; <span class="greekheb">σώζεσθε</span>, the certain blessed future; and <span class="greekheb">εἰ κατέχετε</span>, the abiding condition to the attainment of this end; while <span class="greekheb">ἐκτὸς εἰ μὴ εἰκῆ ἐπιστ</span>. in turn denotes the exaltation above every doubt in respect of the Messianic salvation really to be attained under this conditio.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τίνι λόγῳ</span>] not as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-29.htm" title="Therefore came I to you without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent you have sent for me?">Acts 10:29</a>, <span class="ital">with what ground</span> (Wetstein, Kypke, Heydenreich, and others, following Theodorus of Mopsuestia and Pelagius), which Osiander takes of <span class="ital">scriptural ground</span>; for <span class="greekheb">παρέδωκα γὰρ ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-3.htm" title="For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;">1 Corinthians 15:3</a>, gives, in fact, not a ground, but the <span class="ital">contents</span> of the preaching. Hence also it does not refer to the “<span class="ital">manner and method</span> of the proclamation” (Neander), but means: <span class="ital">through what word</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">preaching what</span>. As regards <span class="greekheb">τίνι</span>, instead of a relative, see Buttmann, <span class="ital">neut. Gr.</span> p. 216 [E. T. 251]. How different from the seductive discourses of the deniers had this <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> of the apostle been! According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">τίνι λόγῳ</span> is meant to be <span class="ital">interrogative</span>, and that in the sense of “<span class="ital">with what presupposition</span>,” while <span class="greekheb">εἰ κατέχετε</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ εἰκῆ ἐπιστ</span>. are the <span class="ital">answer</span> to it. Against this it may be urged: (1) that, since <span class="greekheb">εἰ μὴ εἰκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπιστ</span>. would be a second condition, Paul would have marked the connection in an intelligible way by <span class="greekheb">καί</span> (putting therefore either <span class="greekheb">καὶ εἰ</span> or <span class="greekheb">καί</span> by itself, but not simply <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>); (2) that <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, in the sense of <span class="ital">condition</span> or <span class="ital">presupposition</span>, is foreign to the N.

THE FACTS CONCERNING CHRIST’S RESURRECTION. The doubt which the Ap. combats strikes at the fundamental, probative fact of his Gospel.

This chapter is one of the deepest and most mysterious in the Bible. It is the one exception to the statement in ch. 3 that St Paul was unable to feed the Corinthians with meat; for it ranks with the profound exposition of the principles of Justification in the Epistle to the Romans, and the weighty but most difficult enunciation of the doctrine of God’s foreknowledge and man’s call in the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians. The chapter may be divided into six parts.
