As there is in the vegetable growth, in the varieties of animal life, and in the diversities of form assumed by inorganic matter, an identity preserved amid ever-varying form or variety of “body,” so a change in the form or glory of our organism which we call our “body” is compatible with the preservation of personal identity. The “it,” the personality, remains the same—now in corruption, then in incorruption; now in dishonour, then in glory; now in weakness, then in power.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:...">1 Corinthians 15:42-44</a></span>. <span class="ital">So also is the resurrection of the dead </span>— So great is the difference between the body which fell and that which rises. It is to be observed, that in this and the following verses, the apostle is giving an account of the righteous only. <span class="ital">It is sown </span>— A beautiful word; committed as seed to the ground: and the apostle thus expresses the burial of the body, because he had illustrated the possibility of its resurrection, notwithstanding it rots in the grave, or is otherwise destroyed, by the example of grain sown in the earth, which after it rots produces grain of the same kind with itself; a comparison intended to illustrate only the possibility of the resurrection, but not the manner of its being effected. For certainly the body to be raised will not be produced by any virtue in the body buried, as plants are produced by a virtue latent in the seeds that are sown. For we are carefully taught in the Scriptures, that the resurrection of our bodies will be effected merely by the extraordinary and miraculous power of God, and not at all as either plants or animals are produced, in a natural way, from their seeds. <span class="ital">In corruption </span>— Just ready to putrefy, and by various degrees of corruption and decay, to return to the dust from whence it came. <span class="ital">It is raised in incorruption </span>— Utterly incapable of either dissolution or decay. <span class="ital">It is sown in dishonour </span>— Shocking to those who loved it best: human nature in disgrace! <span class="ital">It is raised in glory </span>— Clothed with robes of light, fit for those whom the King of heaven delights to honour. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-23.htm" title="But he that received seed into the good ground is he that hears the word, and understands it; which also bears fruit, and brings forth, some an hundred times, some sixty, some thirty.">Matthew 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>. <span class="ital">It is sown in weakness </span>— Deprived even of that feeble strength which it once enjoyed: <span class="ital">it is raised in power </span>— Endued with vigour, strength, and activity, such as we cannot now conceive. <span class="ital">It is sown </span>in this world <span class="ital">a natural body </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">an animal body, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σωμα ψυχικον </span>more properly signifies, supported by food, sleep, and air, as the bodies of all animals are: <span class="ital">it is raised a spiritual body </span>— Of a more refined contexture, needing none of those animal refreshments, and endued with qualities of a spiritual nature like the angels of God. These alterations to be produced in the contexture of the bodies of the righteous are indeed great and wonderful, but far from being impossible. For, as Dr. Macknight justly observes, “to illustrate great things by small, we have an example of a similar, though very inferior transformation, in the bodies of caterpillars, which in their first state are ugly, weak, and easily crushed, but in their second state become beautifully winged animals, full of life and activity. This shows what God can do in greater instances.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may not be improper to add here, what is justly observed by the same author, that, notwithstanding this great difference between the bodies raised, and the bodies committed to the ground, those raised will, in a sound sense, be the same with the bodies that were buried; inasmuch as they will consist of members and organs of sensation in form and use similar to the members and organs of the present body: that is, as far as their new state will admit; a limitation this, absolutely necessary to be made, because the Scripture itself mentions two particulars, and reason suggests others, in which the bodies raised will essentially differ from those which died. 1st, We are told (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-13.htm" title="Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for fornication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body.">1 Corinthians 6:13</a>) that God will destroy both the <span class="ital">belly, </span>(including both the <span class="ital">stomach </span>and <span class="ital">bowels,</span>) or the use of that member, and <span class="ital">meats. </span>2d, Our Lord assures us, that <span class="ital">they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage, for they are equal to the angels. </span>From these texts it follows, that none of the members necessary to eating, and drinking, and marriage, will make part of the glorified bodies of the saints; and that none of the appetites and passions which are gratified by these members, will have any existence in their minds: consequently, the joys of the heavenly country, though in part they are to arise from bodily senses, will have no affinity with the pleasures of a Mohammedan paradise. 3d, Reason directs us to believe, that to the similarity or sameness of the body which is raised, with the body that was buried, it is by no means necessary that the imperfections in the members of the buried body, should take place in the raised body. On the contrary, the restoration of all the members to their proper form, place, and office in the body, instead of making it a different body, will render it more perfectly the same. 4th, Besides the differences mentioned, there may be other differences likewise in the glorified bodies of the saints, suited to the difference of their state, of which at present we can form no conception. For if the raised body is to be endowed with new powers of action, and new senses, these may require additional members; and notwithstanding the addition, the raised body may, on account of its general similarity to the body that was buried, be still considered as the same. To conclude, the Scripture speaks consistently when, in describing the state of the righteous after the resurrection, it represents them as having their mortal bodies refashioned like to the glorious body of Christ, and informs us, that after their whole persons are thus completed, they shall be carried to a heavenly country, where every object being suited to the nature of their glorified bodies, they shall live unspeakably happy to all eternity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:35-50 1. How are the dead raised up? that is, by what means? How can they be raised? 2. As to the bodies which shall rise. Will it be with the like shape, and form, and stature, and members, and qualities? The former objection is that of those who opposed the doctrine, the latter of curious doubters. To the first the answer is, This was to be brought about by Divine power; that power which all may see does somewhat like it, year after year, in the death and revival of the corn. It is foolish to question the Almighty power of God to raise the dead, when we see it every day quickening and reviving things that are dead. To the second inquiry; The grain undergoes a great change; and so will the dead, when they rise and live again. The seed dies, though a part of it springs into new life, though how it is we cannot fully understand. The works of creation and providence daily teach us to be humble, as well as to admire the Creator's wisdom and goodness. There is a great variety among other bodies, as there is among plants. There is a variety of glory among heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly bodies. The bodies of the dead, when they rise, will be fitted for the heavenly state; and there will be a variety of glories among them. Burying the dead, is like committing seed to the earth, that it may spring out of it again. Nothing is more loathsome than a dead body. But believers shall at the resurrection have bodies, made fit to be for ever united with spirits made perfect. To God all things are possible. He is the Author and Source of spiritual life and holiness, unto all his people, by the supply of his Holy Spirit to the soul; and he will also quicken and change the body by his Spirit. The dead in Christ shall not only rise, but shall rise thus gloriously changed. The bodies of the saints, when they rise again, will be changed. They will be then glorious and spiritual bodies, fitted to the heavenly world and state, where they are ever afterwards to dwell. The human body in its present form, and with its wants and weaknesses, cannot enter or enjoy the kingdom of God. Then let us not sow to the flesh, of which we can only reap corruption. And the body follows the state of the soul. He, therefore, who neglects the life of the soul, casts away his present good; he who refuses to live to God, squanders all he has.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So also is the resurrection - In a manner similar to the grain that is sown, and to the different degrees of splendor and magnificence in the bodies in the sky and on the earth. The dead shall be raised in a manner analogous to the springing up of grain; and there shall be a difference between the body here and the body in the resurrection.<p>It is sown - In death. As we sow or plant the kernel in the earth.<p>In corruption - In the grave; in a place where it shall be corrupt; in a form tending to putrefaction, disorganization, and dust.<p>It is raised in incorruption - It will be so raised. In the previous verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm">1 Corinthians 15:36-41</a> he had reasoned from analogy, and had demonstrated that it was possible that the dead should rise, or that there was no greater difficulty attending it than actually occurred in the events which were in fact constantly taking place. He here states positively what would be, and affirms that it was not only possible, but that such a resurrection would actually occur. They body would be raised "in incorruption," "uncorruptible" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-52.htm">1 Corinthians 15:52</a>; that is, no more liable to decay, sickness, disorganization, and putrefaction. This is one characteristic of the body that shall be raised, that it shall be no more liable, as here, to wasting sickness, to disease, and to the loathsome corruption of the grave. That God can form a body of that kind, no one can doubt; that he actually will, the apostle positively affirms. That such will be the bodies of the saints is one of the most cheering prospects that can be presented to those who are here wasted away by sickness, and who look with dread and horror on the loathsome putrefaction of the tomb. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>42. sown&#8212;Following up the image of seed.

In the earthly body the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span>, not the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, is that which conditions its constitution and its qualities, so that it is framed as the organ of the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span>;[79] in the resurrection-body the reverse is the case; the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, for whose life-activity it is the adequate organ, conditions its nature, and the <span class="greekheb">ψυχή</span> has ceased to be, as formerly, the ruling and determining element. We are not, however, on this account to assume, with Rückert, that Paul conceived the soul as not continuing to subsist for ever,—a conception which would do away with the essential completeness and thereby with the identity of the human being. On the contrary, he has conceived of the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in the risen bodies as the absolutely dominant element, to which the psychical powers and activities shall be completely subordinated. The whole predicates of the resurrection-body, contrasted with the properties of the present body, are united in the <span class="ital">likeness to the angels</span>, which Jesus affirms of the risen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-30.htm" title="For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.">Matthew 22:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-36.htm" title="Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.">Luke 20:36</a>, and in their being fashioned like unto the glorified body of Christ, as is promised by Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-48.htm" title="As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly....">1 Corinthians 15:48-49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Php 3:21</a>. How far the doctrine of Paul is exalted above the assertion by the Rabbins of the (quite crass) identity of the resurrection-body with the present one, may be seen from the citations in Wetstein on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-36.htm" title="You fool, that which you sow is not quickened, except it die:">1 Corinthians 15:36</a>, and in Eisenmenger, <span class="ital">entdeckt.

It is to be shown, namely, that it is not an air-drawn fancy to speak of the future existence of a <span class="greekheb">σῶμα πνευματικόν</span>: <span class="ital">If it is true that there is a psychical body, then there is also a spiritual body</span>, then such a body cannot be a <span class="ital">non-ens</span>—according to the mutually conditioning relations of the antitheses.

The logical <span class="ital">correctness</span> of the sentence, again, depends upon the presupposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1 Corinthians 15:42</a> f.) that the present and the future body stand <span class="ital">in the relation of counterparts</span> to each other. If, therefore, there exists a psychical body (and that is the present one), then a pneumatic body also must be no mere idea, but really existent (and that is the resurrection-body).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[76] It is to be observed that Paul, in his whole discussion regarding the <span class="ital">nature</span> of the future bodies, has in view only those of the first resurrection (see on ver. 23), leaving quite out of account the bodies of those who shall belong to the second resurrection, and consequently to the <span class="greekheb">τέλος</span>, ver. 24. He has in fact to do with <span class="ital">believers</span>, with future sharers in the resurrection of the righteous (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Php 3:11</a>), whose resurrection-hope was being assailed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[77] Not as Hofmann would have it, in connection with his inappropriate interpretation of <span class="greekheb">σπείρεται</span>: <span class="ital">up to the point, when it is given over to death</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[78] Or as Zeller in the <span class="ital">theol.
