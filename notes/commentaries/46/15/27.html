The connection is, Christ must reign until he has put all enemies under his feet. Christ must triumph, <span class= "ital">for</span> according to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm" title="You made him to have dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet:">Psalm 8:6</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/110-1.htm" title="The LORD said to my Lord, Sit you at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.">Psalm 110:1</a>), God hath put all things under man, and in a higher sense under the Son of Man. (For a similar application of Old Testament statement regarding man to Christ as the Son of Man, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-16.htm" title="And said to him, Hear you what these say? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings you have perfected praise?">Matthew 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-7.htm" title="You made him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and did set him over the works of your hands:">Hebrews 2:7</a>.) But when God says that all things are put under Him, He evidently is excepted who did put all things under Him. This leads up logically to the complete triumph of God the Father, expressed in the following verse, which is an expansion of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24</a>, on which see Note there.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:20-34 All that are by faith united to Christ, are by his resurrection assured of their own. As through the sin of the first Adam, all men became mortal, because all had from him the same sinful nature, so, through the resurrection of Christ, shall all who are made to partake of the Spirit, and the spiritual nature, revive, and live for ever. There will be an order in the resurrection. Christ himself has been the first-fruits; at his coming, his redeemed people will be raised before others; at the last the wicked will rise also. Then will be the end of this present state of things. Would we triumph in that solemn and important season, we must now submit to his rule, accept his salvation, and live to his glory. Then shall we rejoice in the completion of his undertaking, that God may receive the whole glory of our salvation, that we may for ever serve him, and enjoy his favour. What shall those do, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Perhaps baptism is used here in a figure, for afflictions, sufferings, and martyrdom, as Mt 20:22,23. What is, or will become of those who have suffered many and great injuries, and have even lost their lives, for this doctrine of the resurrection, if the dead rise not at all? Whatever the meaning may be, doubtless the apostle's argument was understood by the Corinthians. And it is as plain to us that Christianity would be a foolish profession, if it proposed advantage to themselves by their faithfulness to God; and to have our fruit to holiness, that our end may be everlasting life. But we must not live like beasts, as we do not die like them. It must be ignorance of God that leads any to disbelieve the resurrection and future life. Those who own a God and a providence, and observe how unequal things are in the present life, how frequently the best men fare worst, cannot doubt as to an after-state, where every thing will be set to rights. Let us not be joined with ungodly men; but warn all around us, especially children and young persons, to shun them as a pestilence. Let us awake to righteousness, and not sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For he hath put - God has put by promise, purpose, or decree.<p>All things under his feet - He has made all things subject to him; or has appointed him to be head over all things; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm">Ephesians 1:20-22</a>. It is evident that Paul here refers to some promise or prediction respecting the Messiah, though he does not expressly quote any passage, or make it certain to what he refers. The "words" "hath put all things under his feet" are found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a>, as applicable to "man," and as designed to show the dignity and dominion of man. Whether the psalm has any reference to the Messiah, has been made a question. Those who are disposed to see an examination of this question, may find it in Stuart on the Hebrews, on <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6-8</a>; and in Excurses ix. of the same work, pp. 568-570. Ed. 1833. In the passage before us, it is not "necessary" to suppose that Paul meant to say that the psalm had a particular reference to the Messiah. All that is implied is, that it was the intention of God to subdue all things to him; this was the general strain of the prophecies in regard to him; this was the purpose of God; and this idea is accurately expressed in the words of the psalm; or these words will convey the "general sense" of the prophetic writings in regard to the Messiah. It may be true, also, that although the passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1-9</a> has no immediate and direct reference to the Messiah, yet it includes him as one who possessed human nature.<p>The psalm may be understood as affirming that all things were subjected to "human nature;" that is, human nature had dominion and control over all. But this was more particularly and eminently true of the Messiah than of any other man. In all other cases, great as was the dignity of man, yet his control over "all things" was limited and partial. In the Messiah it was to be complete and entire. His dominion, therefore, was a complete fulfillment, that is, "filling up" (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  ple&#772;ro&#772;ma) of the words in the psalm. Under him alone was there to be an entire accomplishment of what is there said; and as that psalm was to be fulfilled, as it was to be true that it might be said of man that all things were subject to him, it was to be fulfilled mainly in the person of the Messiah, whose human nature was to be exalted above all things; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6-9</a><p>But when he saith - When God says, or when it is said; when that promise is made respecting the Messiah.<p>It is manifest - It must be so; it must be so understood and interpreted.<p>That he is excepted ... - That God is excepted; that it cannot mean that the appointing power is to be subject to him. Paul may have made this remark for several reasons. Perhaps:<p>(1) To avoid the possibility of cavil, or misconstruction of the phrase, "all things," as if it meant that God would be included, and would be subdued to him; as among the pagan, Jupiter is fabled to have expelled his father Saturn from his throne and from heaven.<p>(2) it might be to prevent the supposition, from what Paul had said of the extent of the Son's dominion, that he was in any respect superior to the Father. It is implied by this exception here, that when the necessity for the special mediatorial kingdom of the Son should cease, there would be a resuming of the authority and dominion of the Father, in the manner in which it subsisted before the incarnation.<p>(3) the expression may also be regarded as intensive or emphatic; as denoting, in the most absolute sense, that there was nothing in the universe, but God, which was not subject to him. God was the only exception; and his dominion, therefore, was absolute over all other beings and things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27. all things&#8212;including death (compare Eph 1:22; Php 3:21; Heb 2:8; 1Pe 3:22). It is said, "hath put," for what God has said is the same as if it were already done, so sure is it. Paul here quotes Ps 8:6 in proof of his previous declaration, "For (it is written), 'He hath put all things under His feet.'"<p>under his feet&#8212;as His footstool (Ps 110:1).

This is a reason proving that all enemies, and death itself, shall be put under the feet of Christ, and is taken out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> which is spoken of one that is styled man, and the son of man; and is to be understood not of Adam in a state of innocence; for the word there used signifies a frail mortal man, which he then was not, nor could he be called the son of man; and though the earth was subdued and subject to him, and he had dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowls of the air, and every living thing that moveth on the earth, yet all creatures were not subject to him in this large sense, in which it is here and elsewhere explained by the apostle; and much less of man in his fallen state, who instead of having all things under his feet, is become like the beasts that perish; many of them: are unsubdued to him, and he is even in fear of them, and he himself is subject to corruption and vanity: but of the man Christ Jesus, who took and bore all the sinless infirmities of human nature; is often called the son of man; of whom God was mindful, and whom lie visited in his state of humiliation, at the time of his death, resurrection, and exaltation; who was made through sufferings of death a little lower, or a little while lower than the angels, but now crowned with glory and honour; in whose days God ordained strength and praise out of the mouths of babes and sucklings, to the confusion of his enemies; and has put all things under his feet, which may elude all things animate and inanimate, the whole creation and universe of things, the world and its fulness, the earth and all that is therein, the beasts of the forest, and the cattle of a thousand hills; he is heir of the world, and has a right to it, and to dispose of it, not merely as the Creator, but as Mediator; it is put in subjection to him to make use of, and what is in it to subserve his mediatorial kingdom and his glory; when his ends are answered by it, the earth and all that is therein shall be burnt up, and a new earth arise out of it, in which Christ and his people will dwell: the air and all that is therein are under him; the fowls of it are at his dispose; he it was that rained feathered fowls as the sand of the sea, about the camp of the Israelites in the wilderness, and commanded the ravens to feed Elijah in distress; and who holds the winds in his fist, lets them loose, calls them in, and commands them at pleasure; as he also does the sea, and the boisterous waves of it, and has dominion over the fishes in it; one of those supplied him with money, to pay his tribute; and multitudes of them, more than once, were gathered together, and taken up by his order and direction; and at the last day, the sea at his command will give up the dead that are in it; yea, this may extend to all rational creatures, angels and men, friends or foes: good angels, principalities and powers, are subject to him, as appears by their attendance on him: at his incarnation, ascension, and second coming; by their ministration to him in the wilderness, and in the garden; by their employment under him, for the good of the heirs of salvation; by their dependence on him, as their Creator and head, and by their adoration of him as their Lord and God. Evil angels, the devils, are also put under his feet, as is evident from his overcoming Satan, and baffling all his temptations; by his dispossessing the devils out of the bodies of men, and giving his disciples also power over them; by his spoiling them at death, and triumphing over them in his ascension; by delivering his people out of their hands, and power, in conversion; and by his binding of Satan during the thousand years, and by casting him and his angels into everlasting fire prepared for them. Elect men are made subject to him, by the power of his grace upon them; and yet their subjection to him, to his Gospel ordinances, and the sceptre of his kingdom; is voluntary and from their hearts; it proceeds from a principle of love to him; and is universal, being a regard unto, and a compliance with all his precepts; and evil men are also under his dominion and control; he rules them with a rod of iron; he disappoints their counsels, restrains their wrath, overrules their evil designs and actions against his people for good; and will one day gather them all before him, pass the righteous sentence on them, and send them into everlasting punishment. Moreover, this may reach to everything that is for the glory of Christ as Mediator, and for the good of his church, and to every enemy of his or theirs, as the world, sin, Satan, and the last enemy, death; to prove the subjection of all which to Christ, this testimony is produced: and respects Christ as Mediator, and the Father's delivering all things into his hands, and giving him all power in heaven and in earth, and rule over all creatures and things; <p>but when he saith all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him; that is, when David, or the Holy Spirit by him, said the above words, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-6.htm">Psalm 8:6</a> nothing is more clear and evident, than that God the Father, who made all things subject to Christ as Mediator, is himself not subjected to him; since his power as such must be greater than his: this exception is made to secure the government, power, and honour of the Father; for though he has made his firstborn higher than the kings of the earth, yet not higher than himself; and though he has set him his King over his holy hill of Zion, yet not over himself; and though it is his will that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father, yet not above him, or more than he; nor has he quitted the government, either in the world or in the church, by subjecting all things to Christ: and this exception is also made to confirm the universal power and empire of Christ, for an exception to a general rule does but the more establish it; and since the Father is only excepted, it is a clear case, that he has left nothing that is not put under him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a> but it must be observed, that though the Holy Spirit is not mentioned, yet he is equally excepted; since he is the one God with the Father, and was jointly concerned in the mission, unction, and installation of Christ, as Mediator; nor can he be reckoned among the all things put in subjection to Christ, for they regard only creatures, and many of these enemies, with neither of which the Spirit of God can be numbered; and though the gifts and graces of the Spirit are put into Christ's hands, and are at his dispose, yet the person of the Spirit can never be thought to be put under his feet. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For he hath put all things under his feet.

How naturally, on the contrary, would he be led to think of the subject of <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span>, consequently <span class="ital">God</span>, as the speaker also in <span class="greekheb">εἵπῃ</span>!

The opening <span class="greekheb">γὰρ</span> adduces, by way of comment, a prophecy parl[2387] to that cited in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a> and specifically applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm" title="The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.">1 Corinthians 15:26</a>.

But (<span class="greekheb">δὲ</span> … <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) this subjection of all things to Christ is no infringement of God’s sovereignty nor alienation of His rights; on the contrary, it is the means to their perfect realisation. Such is the purport of the two <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> sentences, the second of which repeats in another way, after the interposed <span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι</span> clause, what the first has announced, <span class="greekheb">τότε αὐτὸς ὁ υἱὸς</span> furnishing their common apodosis (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 54); so Hf[2388], R.V. marg., after the Vg[2389] and Lat. interpreters. The two vv. then read as follows: “For ‘all things did He put in subjection under His feet’. But when He hath said, ‘All things are brought to subjection’ (manifestly, with the exception of Him that put all things in subjection to Him)—yea, when all things have become subject to Him, then shall (also) the Son Himself become subject to Him that made subject to Him all things, to the end that God may be all in all”.—<span class="ital">God</span> is the tacit subject of <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span>, as supplied by the familiar Ps. and brought out by the ptps. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm" title="For he has put all things under his feet. But when he said all things are put under him, it is manifest that he is excepted, which did put all things under him.">1 Corinthians 15:27</a><span class="ital"> b</span>, 28<span class="ital">b</span>; but <span class="ital">Christ</span> is subject to <span class="greekheb">εἴπῃ</span>—not <span class="ital">God</span> speaking in Scr., or at the end of the world (so Mr[2390], Ed[2391], El[2392], etc.), nor <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span> (D.W[2393], and others), nor <span class="ital">propheta</span> (Bg[2394]). “All things are subdued!” is the joyful announcement <span class="ital">by the Son</span> that the grand promise recorded in the 8th Psalm is fulfilled; “the <span class="greekheb">ὑπέταξεν</span> of God affirms the purpose, the <span class="greekheb">ὑποτέτακται</span> of Christ attests its accomplishment” (Hf[2395], Hn[2396]). Thus <span class="greekheb">ὅταν εἴπῃ</span> is simultaneous with <span class="greekheb">ὅταν καταργήσῃ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1 Corinthians 15:24</a>) and <span class="greekheb">ὅταν θῇ ὑπὸ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πόδας</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet.">1 Corinthians 15:25</a>): Christ proclaims the victory at last achieved; He reports that, with the abolition of death, His commission is ended and the travail of His soul satisfied. For anticipatory sayings of His, giving an earnest of this crowning word, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-27.htm" title="All things are delivered to me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.">Matthew 11:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm" title="And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.">Matthew 28:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-35.htm" title="The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.">John 3:35</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ὅταν ὑποταγῇ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

Those who read <span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as a principal sentence, the apodosis to the first <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> clause (A.V., Mr[2397], El[2398], etc.), borrow from the protasis <span class="greekheb">πάντα ὑποτέτακται</span>—more strictly <span class="greekheb">ὑποτετάξεται</span> or (by zeugma) <span class="greekheb">ἔσται</span>, after the virtually fut[2399] <span class="greekheb">εἴπῃ</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> 28<span class="ital">b</span>, 54<span class="ital">b</span>); this, however, makes a halting sentence: “But when He [God] says, ‘All things have been made subject,’ it is evident [that this will be, <span class="ital">or</span> that all things will be subjected] with the exception of Him, etc.”—an affirmation of quite subsidiary importance, on which the writer has no need to dwell. The non-inclusion of <span class="ital">God</span> in the category of “things subjected” is rather a self-evident assumption made by the way, and serving to prepare for and throw into relief the real apodosis, “then shall the Son Himself also become subject, etc.,” to which both the <span class="greekheb">ὅταν</span> clauses press forward. The advl[2400] use of <span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι</span> (perhaps better written <span class="greekheb">δηλονότι</span> = <span class="greekheb">δηλαδή</span>), signifying <span class="ital">manifestly</span> or <span class="ital">to wit (sine dubio</span>, Vg[2401]), is familiar in Attic Gr[2402]; no other certain instance occurs in the N.T. The remark that He who <span class="ital">gave</span> dominion is not Himself <span class="ital">under</span> it, reserves behind the Messianic reign the absolute supremacy of God, to which Christ will conform at the plenitude of His kingship.—<span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> (equivalent to “the universe”) gathers into a totality the <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> otherwise separate and diverse: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-17.htm" title=" And he is before all things, and by him all things consist.">Colossians 1:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα ἐν αὐτῷ συνέστηκεν</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ὑποταγήσεται</span> (mid[2403] in force, like the 2nd aor[2404] pass[2405] in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>, in consistency with the initiative ascribed to Christ throughout) has often been explained away, to avoid Arian or Sabellian inferences from the text; it affirms no other subjection of the Son than is involved in Sonship (see note on 24). This implies no inferiority of nature, no extrusion from power, but the free submission of love (<span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς ὁ υἱός</span>, “the Son of His own accord will subject Himself”—not in addition to, but in distinction from the <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>), which is the essence of the filial spirit that actuated Christ from first to last (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-29.htm" title="And he that sent me is with me: the Father has not left me alone; for I do always those things that please him.">John 8:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-27.htm" title="Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour: but for this cause came I to this hour.">John 12:27</a>, etc.). Whatsoever glory He gains is devoted to the glory and power of the Father (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm" title="As you have given him power over all flesh, that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.">John 17:2</a>, etc.), who glorifies Him in turn (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm" title="And now, O Father, glorify you me with your own self with the glory which I had with you before the world was.">John 17:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-9.htm" title="Why God also has highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name:">Php 2:9</a> ff.). <span class="greekheb">ὑποταγήσεται</span> speaks the closing word of Christ’s mission, as <span class="greekheb">Ἰδοὺ ἥκω τοῦ ποιῆσαι τὸ θέλημά σου</span> was its opening word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-7.htm" title="Then said I, See, I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me,) to do your will, O God.">Hebrews 10:7</a>).—It is hard to say whether <span class="greekheb">ζνα ᾖ ὁ Θεὸς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is dependent on <span class="greekheb">ὁ υἱὸς ὑποταγήσεται</span> (so most commentt.) or on <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑποτάξαντι</span> (so Hf[2406], and some others). This solemn conclusion most fitly attaches to the princ. vb[2407]; it expresses the loyal <span class="ital">purpose of the Son</span> in His self-subjection, whose submission exhibits the unity of the Godhead (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/10-30.htm" title="I and my Father are one....">John 10:30-36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-23.htm" title="I in them, and you in me, that they may be made perfect in one; and that the world may know that you have sent me, and have loved them, as you have loved me.">John 17:23</a>), and constitutes itself the focus and uniting bond of a universe in which God’s will is everywhere regnant and His being everywhere immanent.—<span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν</span> <span class="ital">neuter</span>, like <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2387] parallel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2388] J.
