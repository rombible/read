But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That in every thing - In every respect, or in regard to all the favors conferred on any of his people. You have been distinguished by him in all those respects in which he blesses his own children.<p>Ye are enriched by him; - compare the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-4.htm">Romans 2:4</a>. The meaning of this expression is, "you abound in these things; they are conferred abundantly upon you." By the use of this word, the apostle intends doubtless to denote "the fact" that these blessings had been conferred on them abundantly; and also that this was a "valuable endowment," so as to be properly called "a treasure." The mercies of God are not only conferred abundantly on his people, but they are a bestowment of inestimable value; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-10.htm">2 Corinthians 6:10</a>.<p>In all utterance - With the power of speaking various languages &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#837;  en panti logo&#772;. That this power was conferred on the church at Corinth, and that it was highly valued by them, is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14.htm">1 Corinthians 14</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-7.htm">2 Corinthians 8:7</a>. The power of speaking those languages the apostle regarded as a subject of thanksgiving, as it was a proof of the divine favor to them; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-5.htm">1 Corinthians 14:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-22.htm">1 Corinthians 14:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-39.htm">1 Corinthians 14:39</a>.<p>And in all knowledge - In the knowledge of divine truth. They had understood the doctrines which they had heard, and had intelligently embraced them. This was not true of all of them, but it was of the body of the church; and the hearty commendation and thanksgiving of the apostle for these favors, laid the foundation for the remarks which he had subsequently to make, and would tend to conciliate their minds, and dispose them to listen attentively, even to the language of reproof. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. utterance&#8212;Alford from Menochius translates, "doctrine." Ye are rich in preachers or the preaching of the word, and rich in knowledge or apprehension of it: literally "(the) word (preached)." English Version (as in 2Co 8:7) is better: for Paul, purposing presently to dwell on the abuse of the two gifts on which the Corinthians most prided themselves, utterance (speech) and knowledge (1Co 1:20; 3:18; 4:19; 1Co 13:1-14:40), previously gains their goodwill by congratulating them on having those gifts.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">In every thing; </span> in every grace and in every good gift, (for he is manifestly speaking of spiritual things), so as this general particle must not be extended to the things of this life, but restrained either to spiritual gifts, or spiritual, sanctifying habits.
