These gifts the Corinthians particularly admired. Therefore this congratulation naturally tended to soften their spirits, and make way for the reproofs which follow. <span class="ital">Even as the testimony of Christ — </span>The gospel, which testifies of Christ, and declares the will of God concerning the way of saving sinners, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm" title="And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness to all nations; and then shall the end come.">Matthew 24:14</a>; <span class="ital">was confirmed in </span>— Or among, <span class="ital">you </span>— That is, was plainly proved to be from God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-10.htm" title="And I fell at his feet to worship him.

They knew they had received these gifts by the hand of Paul, and that long before the false teachers came among them, and that they had received none from them. And this consideration was highly proper to revive in them their former reverence and affection for their spiritual father, and to show them how much they were to blame for attaching themselves to teachers who had given them no proof at all either of their divine mission or of the truth of their doctrine. <span class="ital">So that ye come behind </span>— Other churches, and are defective <span class="ital">in no gift </span>— Namely, tending to edification and confirmation in the faith and hope of the gospel; <span class="ital">waiting for the coming </span>— <span class="greekheb">Την αποκαλυψιν</span>, <span class="ital">the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ </span>— A sure mark of a true or false Christian, to long for, or dread, the second glorious revelation of the Lord Jesus. The apostle speaks here, not of all individual believers at Corinth, but of the church there in general; as having in it many spiritual persons, who possessed all the different spiritual gifts which common believers could enjoy. Accordingly he asked them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-13.htm" title="For what is it wherein you were inferior to other churches, except it be that I myself was not burdensome to you? forgive me this wrong.">2 Corinthians 12:13</a>, <span class="ital">What is it wherein ye were inferior to other churches?

Now it is our day, wherein we are to work out our salvation: then it will be eminently <span class="ital">the day of Christ, </span>and of his glory in the saints. <span class="ital">God is faithful </span>to all his promises, and therefore <span class="ital">to him that hath shall be given: by whom ye were called </span>— By his word and Spirit; <span class="ital">unto the fellowship of his Son </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To partake, through him, of all the blessings of the gospel. And this calling, as if he had said, you should consider as a pledge of his willingness to save you unto the uttermost.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-9 All Christians are by baptism dedicated and devoted to Christ, and are under strict obligations to be holy. But in the true church of God are all who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, and who call upon him as God manifest in the flesh, for all the blessings of salvation; who acknowledge and obey him as their Lord, and as Lord of all; it includes no other persons. Christians are distinguished from the profane and atheists, that they dare not live without prayer; and they are distinguished from Jews and pagans, that they call on the name of Christ. Observe how often in these verses the apostle repeats the words, Our Lord Jesus Christ. He feared not to make too frequent or too honourable mention of him. To all who called upon Christ, the apostle gave his usual salutation, desiring, in their behalf, the pardoning mercy, sanctifying grace, and comforting peace of God, through Jesus Christ. Sinners can have no peace with God, nor any from him, but through Christ. He gives thanks for their conversion to the faith of Christ; that grace was given them by Jesus Christ. They had been enriched by him with all spiritual gifts. He speaks of utterance and knowledge. And where God has given these two gifts, he has given great power for usefulness. These were gifts of the Holy Ghost, by which God bore witness to the apostles. Those that wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, will be kept by him to the end; and those that are so, will be blameless in the day of Christ, made so by rich and free grace. How glorious are the hopes of such a privilege; to be kept by the power of Christ, from the power of our corruptions and Satan's temptations!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace be unto you ... - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. peace&#8212;peculiarly needed in the Corinthian church, on account of its dissensions.

Otherwise it would always be <span class="ital">tripartite</span>, and, in particular, would not omit the characteristic <span class="greekheb">ἔλεος</span>.

It was only at a later date that the Aaronic blessing passed over into Christian liturgic use (<span class="ital">Constitt. ap.</span> ii. 57. 13); but a free reminiscence of that blessing may already be contained in the greetings of those late Epistles.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.">1 Corinthians 1:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: Paul’s customary greeting; see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm" title="To all that be in Rome, beloved of God, called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.">Romans 1:7</a>. “The occurrence of the peculiar phrase ‘grace and peace’ in Paul, John, and Peter intimates that we have here the earliest Christian password or <span class="ital">symbolum</span>” (Ed[63]). <span class="greekheb">κυρίου</span> might grammatically be parl[64] to <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>, both depending upon <span class="greekheb">πατρός</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2 Corinthians 1:3</a>, etc.; but 1 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-1.htm" title="Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:">2 Thessalonians 1:1</a> (<span class="greekheb">Θεῷ πατρὶ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κυρίῳ Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>.) prove <span class="ital">Father</span> and <span class="ital">Lord</span> in this formula to be parl[65]: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.">1 Corinthians 8:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="All the saints salute you.">2 Corinthians 13:13</a>; nowhere does P. speak (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-17.htm" title="Jesus said to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brothers, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God.">John 20:17</a>) of God as Father <span class="ital">of Christ and of men</span> co-ordinately, and for <span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span> to come first in such connexion would be incongruous. “The union of” <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου</span> “under the vinculum of a common prp[66] is one of the numberless hints scattered through St. Paul’s epp. of the consciously felt and recognised co-ordination” of the Father and Christ (El[67]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[63] T.

It is also to be noted that the grace and peace are said to come from our Lord Jesus Christ equally with the Father. The same formula is to be found in the greeting of every epistle. But the most remarkable instance of this form of speech is certainly that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-11.htm" title="Now God himself and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, direct our way to you.">1 Thessalonians 3:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_thessalonians/2-16.htm" title="Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which has loved us, and has given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,...">2 Thessalonians 2:16-17</a>, where the Father and the Son stand together as nominatives to a verb in the singular. <span class="ital">Grace</span> is here used in the signification of favour, kindness, rather than in the usual theological signification of Divine assistance. The Apostle is speaking of that Divine favour in the sunshine of which the believer is privileged to dwell, and which produces peace of mind as its natural effect. For it is a cardinal point of his teaching that ‘there is henceforth no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit’ It is to be remembered that our word <span class="ital">grace</span> is derived from the Latin <span class="ital">gratia</span>, the original signification of which is <span class="ital">favour, kindness</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Grace to you and peace.</span> This is St. Paul's greeting in all the Epistles except the pastoral Epistles, in which he beautifully adds the word "mercy." It is a remarkable blending of the Greek and Jewish salutations. The Greeks said <span class="greek">&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, and to them the word "grace" involved the notions of joy and brightness and prosperity. The calmer and more solemn greeting of the East was, "Peace be to thee." The Church unites both forms of greeting - "grace," the beginning of every blessing; "peace," the end of all blessings; and into both she infuses a deeper meaning, that of a "joy" which defied all tribulations, and a" peace which passeth all understanding." <span class="cmt_word">From God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</span> God is the Source of "every good gift and every perfect gift." God is our Father as our Creator, and as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we become, in a higher sense, his children. Christ, in his mediatorial kingdom, is specially and immediately "our Lord," though that phrase, now so universal, only occurs (in its isolated form) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-14.htm">Hebrews 7:14</a>. <span class="accented">Jesus Christ.</span> One of St. Paul's peculiarities of style is the constant reiteration of one dominant word. In the first nine verses of this Epistle, the Name "Jesus Christ" is repeated no less than nine times. "Observe," says St. Chrysostom, "how he <span class="accented">nails them down</span> to the Name of Christ, not mentioning any man, either apostle or teacher, but continually mentioning him for whom they yearn, as men preparing to awaken those who are drowsy after a debauch. For nowhere in any other Epistle is the Name of Christ so continually introduced By means of it he weaves together almost his whole exordium." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Grace - peace<p>Grace is the Greek salutation, peace the Jewish.

This form of salutation is common to all Paul's epistles to the churches. In Timothy and Titus, mercy is added. James alone has the ordinary conventional salutation, &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; rejoice, hail, greeting. </body></html>
