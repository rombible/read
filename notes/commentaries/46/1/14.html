Agreement in the greater things should extinguish divisions about the lesser. There will be perfect union in heaven, and the nearer we approach it on earth, the nearer we come to perfection. Paul and Apollos both were faithful ministers of Jesus Christ, and helpers of their faith and joy; but those disposed to be contentious, broke into parties. So liable are the best things to be corrupted, and the gospel and its institutions made engines of discord and contention. Satan has always endeavoured to stir up strife among Christians, as one of his chief devices against the gospel. The apostle left it to other ministers to baptize, while he preached the gospel, as a more useful work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I thank God ... - Why Paul did not himself baptize, see in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-17.htm">1 Corinthians 1:17</a>.

And if so, then probably Diotrephes <a href="http://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9</a>, who is mentioned as one who loved "to have the pre-eminence," had been one cause of the difficulties at Corinth.

I thank God's providence now, who so ordered it that I baptized none of you but Crispus (the former ruler of the synagogue, Ac 18:8) and Gaius (written by the Romans Caius, the host of Paul at Corinth, and of the church, Ro 16:23; a person therefore in good circumstances). Baptizing was the office of the deacons (Ac 10:48) rather than of the apostles, whose office was that of establishing and superintending generally the churches. The deacons had a better opportunity of giving the necessary course of instruction preparatory to baptism. Crispus and Gaius were probably among the first converts, and hence were baptized by Paul himself, who founded the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Concerning the apostle’s baptizing Crispus we read, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm" title="And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized.">Acts 18:8</a></span>; he was <span class="ital">the chief ruler of the synagogue</span> of the Jews: why Paul thanks God that he baptized not many, he tells us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.">1 Corinthians 1:15</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I thank God that I baptized none of you,.... The Alexandrian copy and the Syriac version read, "I thank my God"; not that the apostle disliked the ordinance of baptism, or the administration of it; and much less that he thought it criminal, or an evil in him to perform it; nor was he at any time displeased at the numbers of persons who desired it of him; but on the contrary rejoiced where proper subjects of it were brought to a submission to it; but inasmuch as some persons in the church at Corinth made such an ill use of his having baptized them, he was greatly thankful that it was so ordered in providence, that the far greater part of them were baptized by other ministers, either by those who were with him, or came after him; and that he baptized none of them with his own hands, <p>but Crispus and Gaius. The former of these was the chief ruler of the Jewish synagogue at Corinth, who hearing the apostle, and believing in Christ, was baptized by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-8.htm">Acts 18:8</a> and the latter was a very liberal and hospitable man, and was the apostle's host, whilst he was at Corinth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-23.htm">Romans 16:23</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{18}</span> I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</span><p>(18) He protests that he speaks so much the more boldly of these things, because through God's providence, he is void of all suspicion of gathering disciples to himself, and taking them from others.

God be thanked, that I baptized only a very few among you! Accordingly no room has been left for the reproach being brought against me, as it might otherwise have been, that I had baptized into <span class="ital">my own</span> name! “Providentia divina regnat saepe in rebus, quarum ratio postea cognoscitur” (Bengel). Rückert finds fault with the <span class="ital">weakness</span> of this proof, since it was surely the same thing whether Paul had baptized personally or through his assistants. But unjustly. For, since Paul was not generally in the habit of baptizing in person, had he himself baptized many in Corinth, this might undoubtedly have been made use of afterwards by perverse minds for the possible slander that there was a specialty in the case, that he had baptized with his own hand in Corinth, because he did it into <span class="ital">his own</span> name,—a purpose for which, of course, he could not have employed others. Hofmann suggests wrongly: they might have interpreted it, as though he had wished to place the persons concerned “<span class="ital">in a peculiar relation</span>” to himself. This imported indefiniteness is against the definite sense of the words. Just as he had said before, that it was not <span class="ital">he</span> who had been crucified for them in place of <span class="ital">Christ</span>, so he says further, that they had not been baptized into <span class="ital">his</span> name instead of the name of <span class="ital">Christ</span>.

In fact, P. had himself baptised very few of the Cor[181] He sees a providence in this; otherwise he might have seemed wishful to stamp his own name upon his converts, and some colour would have been lent to the action of the Paulinists—“lest any one should say that you were baptised into <span class="ital">my</span> name”.

On second thoughts (“he was reminded by his amanuensis,” Lt[183]; or by Steph. himself), P. remembers that he had “baptised the house of Stephanas” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>, and note), the first family here won to Christ. <span class="greekheb">Στεφανᾶς</span> (perhaps short for <span class="greekheb">Στεφανηφόρος</span>), like <span class="greekheb">Κηφᾶς</span>, takes the Doric gen[184] in -<span class="greekheb">ᾶ</span> usual with proper names in -<span class="greekheb">ᾶς</span>, whether of native or foreign origin (see Bm[185], p. 20).—<span class="greekheb">λοιπὸν οὐκ οἶδα εἴ τινα κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: P. cannot recall any other instance of baptism by his own hands at Cor[186]; this was a slight matter, which left no clear mark in his memory, <span class="greekheb">λοιπόν</span> (more regularly, <span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπόν</span>), “for the rest”—in point of <span class="ital">time</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1 Corinthians 7:29</a>), or <span class="ital">number</span>—a somewhat frequent idiom with Paul (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-2.htm" title="Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.">1 Corinthians 4:2</a>).
