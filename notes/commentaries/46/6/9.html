The mention of gross sensual sins in connection with idolaters points to the fact that they were practically associated in the ritual of the heathen, which, of course, intensified the danger against which the Apostle warns the Corinthians. The prevalence of such scandalous crimes in the heathen world is constantly referred to in the Epistles to Gentile churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-13.htm" title="Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.">Romans 13:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/5-19.htm" title="Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,">Galatians 5:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-9.htm" title="Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for murderers,">1Timothy 1:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm" title="One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The Cretians are always liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.">Titus 1:12</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Indeed, among the heathen idolatry was not only a great crime in itself, but was the parent of many other crimes. For the heathen were encouraged in the commission of fornication, adultery, sodomy, drunkenness, theft, &c., by the example of their gods. <span class="ital">Nor effeminate </span>— Who live in an easy, indolent way, taking up no cross, enduring no hardship. But how is this, that these good-natured, harmless people are ranked with idolaters and sodomites, those infamous degraders of human nature?

There is much force in these inquiries, when we consider that they were addressed to a people puffed up with a fancy of their being above others in wisdom and knowledge. All unrighteousness is sin; all reigning sin, nay, every actual sin, committed with design, and not repented of, shuts out of the kingdom of heaven. Be not deceived. Men are very much inclined to flatter themselves that they may live in sin, yet die in Christ, and go to heaven. But we cannot hope to sow to the flesh, and reap everlasting life. They are reminded what a change the gospel and grace of God had made in them. The blood of Christ, and the washing of regeneration, can take away all guilt. Our justification is owing to the suffering and merit of Christ; our sanctification to the working of the Holy Spirit; but both go together. All who are made righteous in the sight of God, are made holy by the grace of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Know ye not ... - The apostle introduces the declaration in this verse to show the evil of their course, and especially of the injustice which they did one to another, and their attempt to enforce and maintain the evil by an appeal to the pagan tribunals.

A way of speaking much like that in the Talmud,        "know thou, that the world to come is not made but for the righteous?" (h) Without a righteousness there will be no entrance into the world of bliss and happiness hereafter; and this must be a better righteousness than what a sinful creature is capable of working out, and no other than the righteousness of Christ. It was a loss and want of righteousness that cast the angels down from heaven, and turned Adam out of paradise; and whoever of his posterity: are destitute of one, will fall short of enjoying the glory of God; for it is not agreeable to the holy nature of God, to his infinite justice and righteous law, to admit any into heaven without a righteousness: hence a judgment seat is erected, before which all must stand; and those that will be found without a righteousness, will be for ever excluded the kingdom of heaven; and could any unrighteous persons be received there, it would spoil the pleasure and happiness of the saints. Now this is said, partly to dissuade the Corinthians from going to law with each other before unrighteous persons, who have no right to the kingdom of God, and living and dying as they are, will have no share in it; and therefore since they are not to be fellow heirs and companions with them in another world, they should not bring their causes before them in this; and partly to reprove them for their injurious and unrighteous actions among themselves, their tricking and defrauding of one another, with other sins they were guilty of; which, if not repented of, would show, that notwithstanding their profession, they were destitute of the grace of God, were unfit to be in the kingdom of God, in a Gospel church state here below, and would be shut out of the kingdom of heaven hereafter. <p>Be not deceived imagining, that through your knowledge and profession you shall be saved, live as you will: <p>neither fornicators, such as are guilty of uncleanness with persons in a single state: <p>nor idolaters; who worship more gods than one, and not the true God; who do service to them that are not gods, and perform what the Jews call  "strange service": and not only fall down to stocks and stones, but serve divers lusts and pleasures, the idols of their own hearts: <p>nor adulterers: such as have criminal conversation with persons in a married state: <p>nor effeminate; or "soft", or, as the Syriac renders it,  "corrupters"; that is, of themselves, by voluntary pollution, such as are guilty of the sin of Onan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/38-8.htm">Genesis 38:8</a>. <p>Nor abusers of themselves with mankind; sodomites. <p>(h) T.

And this question has three parts: fornication, matrimony, and a single life. As for fornication, he utterly condemns it. And marriage he commands to some, as a good and necessary remedy for them: to others he leaves is free. And others he dissuades from it, not as unlawful, but as inconvenient, and that not without exception. As for singleness of life (under which also I comprehend virginity) he enjoins it to no man: yet he persuades men to it, but not for itself, but for another respect, neither to all men, nor without exception. And being about to speak against fornication, he begins with a general reprehension of those vices, with which that rich and riotous city most abounded: warning and teaching them earnestly, that repentance is inseparable joined with forgiveness of sins, and sanctification with justification.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

First generally, the unjust, wrong-doers, shall not inherit the kingdom of God, that is, His final kingdom in the ‘restitution of all things,’ for which we daily pray. He then proceeds to particulars, and declares that all who lived for themselves, whether set upon sensual indulgence or upon gain, would deprive themselves of the inheritance obtained through faith in Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/6.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-9.htm" title="Know you not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God?

Perhaps the Corinthians thought that they would be saved by the mere fact of having been admitted into God's kingdom (the Christian Church in all its highest privileges) by baptism. St. Paul here lays down, as distinctly as St. James does, that faith without works is dead, and privileges without holiness are abrogated. The spirit of his warning is the same as that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>, "Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord...  are these;" or that of St. John the Baptist, "Say not unto yourselves, We be Abraham's sons." Christians have often been liable to the temptation of underrating the peril which results from the falling asunder of action from knowledge. There can be no greater danger than that of talking slightingly of "mere morality." Religion is not an outward service, but a spiritual life manifested by a holy living. <span class="cmt_word">Be not deceived.</span> So our Lord says," Let no man deceive you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-5.htm">Mark 13:5</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-7.htm">1 John 3:7</a>). St. Paul uses the warning very solemnly again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-33.htm">1 Corinthians 15:33</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm">Galatians 6:7</a>, and St. James in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-16.htm">James 1:16</a>. The self deception of merely verbal orthodoxy is the most dangerous of all. <span class="cmt_word">Neither fornicators</span>. The first four classes of sinners were specially prevalent at Corinth, where, indeed, impurity formed part of the recognized cult of the local Aphrodite (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-21.htm">2 Corinthians 12:21</a>). Lists of these "works of the flesh," which were the all but universal curse and stain of heathendom, occur also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-19.htm">Galatians 5:19-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-10.htm">1 Timothy 1:10</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5-7</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kingdom of God<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a>.<p>Fornicators<p>The besetting sin of Corinth.
