As, however, they would travel through Macedonia, delaying <span class= "ital">en route</span> at the various churches to prepare them for the visit which St. Paul, according to his then intention, purposed paying them after he had been to Corinth, they possibly might not reach Corinth until after this Epistle, which would be carried thither by a more direct route. The Apostle was evidently anxious to know how Timothy would be received by the Corinthians. He was young in years. He was young also in the faith. He had probably a constitutionally weak and timid nature (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1Timothy 3:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Greatly desiring to see you, being mindful of your tears, that I may be filled with joy;">2Timothy 1:4</a>), and he was of course officially very subordinate to St. Paul. In a Church, therefore, some of whose members had gone so far as to question, if not actually to repudiate the authority even of the Apostle himself, and to depreciate him as compared with the elder Apostles, there was considerable danger for one like Timothy. By reminding the Corinthians of the work in which Timothy is engaged, and of its identity with his own work, the Apostle anticipates and protests against any insult being offered to Timothy, because of what a great English statesman once called, in reference to himself, “the atrocious crime of being a young man.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do....">1 Corinthians 16:10-12</a>. </span><span class="ital">Now if </span>— In the mean time; <span class="ital">Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear </span>— Of any one’s despising him for his youth.

There might be some danger that he might feel himself embarrassed among the rich, the frivilous, and the great. Paul, therefore, asks them to encourage him, to receive him kindly, and not to embarrass him. Perhaps, also, there may be some reference to the false teachers whom Timothy might be called on to oppose. They were powerful, and they might endeavor to intimidate and alarm him. Paul, therefore, asks the church to sustain him in his efforts to defend the truth.<p>For he worketh the work of the Lord - He is engaged in the service of the Lord; and he is worthy of your confidence, and worthy to be sustained by you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. Now&#8212;rather, "But." Therefore Timothy was not the bearer of the Epistle; for it would not then be said, "IF Timothy come." He must therefore have been sent by Paul from Ephesus before this Epistle was written, to accord with 1Co 4:17-19; and yet the passage here implies that Paul did not expect him to arrive at Corinth till after the letter was received. He tells them how to treat him "if" he should arrive. Ac 19:21, 22 clears up the difficulty: Timothy, when sent from Ephesus, where this Epistle was written, did not proceed direct to Corinth, but went first to Macedonia; thus though sent before the letter, he might not reach Corinth till after it was received in that city. The undesigned coincidence between the Epistle and the history, and the clearing up of the meaning of the former (which does not mention the journey to Macedonia at all) by the latter, is a sure mark of genuineness [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;]. It is not certain that Timothy actually reached Corinth; for in Ac 19:22 only Macedonia is mentioned; but it does not follow that though Macedonia was the immediate object of his mission, Corinth was not the ultimate object. The "IF Timothy come," implies uncertainty. 2Co 1:1 represents him with Paul in Macedonia; and 2Co 12:18, speaking of Titus and others sent to Corinth, does not mention Timothy, which it would have probably done, had one so closely connected with the apostle as Timothy was, stayed as his delegate at Corinth. The mission of Titus then took place, when it became uncertain whether Timothy could go forward from Macedonia to Corinth, Paul being anxious for immediate tidings of the state of the Corinthian Church. Alford argues that if so, Paul's adversaries would have charged him with fickleness in this case also (2Co 1:17), as in the case of his own change of purpose. But Titus was sent directly to Corinth, so as to arrive there before Timothy could by the route through Macedonia. Titus' presence would thus make amends for the disappointment as to the intended visit of Timothy and would disarm adversaries of a charge in this respect (2Co 7:6, 7).<p>without fear&#8212;Referring perhaps to a nervous timidity in Timothy's character (1Ti 3:15; 5:22, 24). His youth would add to this feeling, as well as his country, Lystra, likely to be despised in refined Corinth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He had told them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For this cause have I sent to you Timotheus, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.">1 Corinthians 4:17</a></span>, that he had sent Timothy unto them, whom he there calleth his <span class="ital">beloved son, and faithful in the Lord.</span> Here he bespeaketh his welcome and security. It is probable he had it in commission from Paul to visit divers other churches in his journey to them, and therefore he speaketh of his coming as uncertain, but chargeth them, that if he did come, they would take care of him, that he might not be exposed to danger or trouble from any party amongst them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For he worketh the work of the Lord, as I also do; </span> for (saith he) he is a minister of the gospel, and engaged in the same work of the Lord that I am. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now if Timotheus come,....

On the former view, “the brethren” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-11.htm" title="Let no man therefore despise him: but conduct him forth in peace, that he may come to me: for I look for him with the brothers....">1 Corinthians 16:11-12</a> are the same, being the deputies who had brought over the Cor[2666] Church Letter to P., and who are now awaiting Tim’s return before they themselves return home. This hints an additional reason why the Cor[2667] should with all speed send Timothy back to Paul “in peace”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2647] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2648] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2649] T.

The question whether Timothy arrived at Corinth before the Apostle, or whether he was detained in Macedonia until St Paul came thither, is one which admits of no certain decision. Dean Alford thinks Timothy arrived there first, and supports his view by the considerations, (1) that his mission is announced in terms too precise to be lightly given up, and (2) that its abandonment would have exposed the Apostle to an additional charge of inconsistency of which we never hear. But, on the other hand, it is remarkable that while we hear a good deal in the second Epistle of Titus’ mission and the report he brought back (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm" title="I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother: but taking my leave of them, I went from there into Macedonia.">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="Therefore we were comforted in your comfort: yes, and exceedingly the more joyed we for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.">2 Corinthians 7:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-6.htm" title="So that we desired Titus, that as he had begun, so he would also finish in you the same grace also.">2 Corinthians 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-16.htm" title="But thanks be to God, which put the same earnest care into the heart of Titus for you....">2 Corinthians 8:16-18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-18.htm" title="I desired Titus, and with him I sent a brother. Did Titus make a gain of you? walked we not in the same spirit? walked we not in the same steps?">2 Corinthians 12:18</a>), there is not a word said about Timothy’s arrival at Corinth, or of his return to St Paul, although (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-1.htm" title="Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,">1 Corinthians 1:1</a>) he was with St Paul when that Epistle was written.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">see that he may be with you without fear</span>] Paley and the late Professor Blunt have remarked on the remarkable agreement of this passage with what we elsewhere learn of the character of Timothy. For (1) he was young (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1 Timothy 4:12</a>), and (2) he seems to have been deficient in courage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-21.htm" title="I charge you before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels, that you observe these things without preferring one before another, doing nothing by partiality....">1 Timothy 5:21-23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-6.htm" title="Why I put you in remembrance that you stir up the gift of God, which is in you by the putting on of my hands....">2 Timothy 1:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm" title="You therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2 Timothy 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.">2 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-1.htm" title="I charge you therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom;...">2 Timothy 4:1-2</a>). If this be the case, there would be special need for this injunction, in the condition in which the Corinthian Church then was. And Timothy must then have been very young indeed. After ten years had passed away, the Apostle could still say, ‘Let no man despise thy youth.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do.">1 Corinthians 16:10</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δἑ</span>, <span class="ital">now</span>) An antithesis between Paul himself and his substitute, Timothy.[158]—<span class="greekheb">ἀφύβως</span>, <span class="ital">without fear</span>) This will be the case, if no man shall have despised him.

But possibly he had <span class="accented">countermanded</span> these directions when he postponed his own visit. In the uncertainties of ancient travelling, be could not be certain whether his counter order would reach Timothy or not. It appears to have done so, for nothing is said of any visit of Timothy to Corinth, and St. Paul sent Titus. <span class="cmt_word">Without fear.</span> Timothy must at this time have been very young (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>). As a mere substitute for St. Paul's personal visit, he would be unacceptable. In every allusion to him we find traces of a somewhat timid and sensitive disposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-21.htm">1 Timothy 5:21-23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-6.htm">2 Timothy 1:6-8</a>, etc.). He may well, therefore, have shrunk from the thought of meeting the haughty sophisters and disputatious partisans of Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">As I also do.</span> "As a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-22.htm">Philippians 2:22</a>). St. Paul felt for Timothy a deeper personal tenderness than for any of his other friends, and the companionship of this gentle and devoted youth was one of the chief comforts of his missionary labour. </body></html>
