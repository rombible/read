The Apostle does not here refer to where he is at the moment of writing, but to his intention regarding his journey. He had intended to go first to Corinth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-15.htm" title="And in this confidence I was minded to come to you before, that you might have a second benefit;">2Corinthians 1:15-16</a>), but he has altered that plan, and says that his intention now is to pass through Macedonia first, and then visit Corinth. Then he says, “For I <span class= "ital">do</span> pass through Macedonia.” To this intention the Apostle adheres. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction.</span>)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia....">1 Corinthians 16:5-9</a>. </span><span class="ital">Now I will come unto you </span>— If Providence permit; <span class="ital">when I shall pass </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">when I shall have passed; through Macedonia; for I do pass through Macedonia </span>— I purpose going that way, that I may visit the churches there, and receive their collections. <span class="ital">And it may be that I will abide, </span>&c. — That I shall continue some time; <span class="ital">yea, and winter with you </span>— Having spent the summer and autumn in my progress through Macedonia. <span class="ital">That ye may bring me on my journey </span>— That some of you may accompany me a little way, and help me forward toward Jerusalem, or <span class="ital">whithersoever </span>else <span class="ital">I go — </span>Through whatever parts I may pass thither. <span class="ital">For, </span>&c. — As if he had said, I speak of coming at some future time; <span class="ital">for I will not see you now </span>— In my way from hence to Macedonia. <span class="ital">But I trust </span>— That the little delay, which this plan may occasion, will be made up to your satisfaction; for I purpose <span class="ital">to tarry a while with you </span>— When I come, which the necessities of the churches of Macedonia will not at present give me leave to do. <span class="ital">But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost </span>— A plain intimation this that he was now at Ephesus, and consequently that the inscription added at the end of this epistle, which tells us it was written from Philippi, is far from being authentic. Indeed, this may be gathered also from the salutations in the close of this epistle, which are not from the churches of Macedonia, but from Asia. And, it may be affirmed in general, that, as Dr. Doddridge justly observes, no credit is to be given to these additions, which have been presumptuously made to the epistles, and very imprudently retained. <span class="ital">For a great door and effectual is opened to me </span>— “The door of a house being a passage into it, <span class="ital">the opening of a door, </span>in the eastern phrase, signified the affording a person an opportunity of doing a thing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm" title=" With praying also for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the mystery of Christ, for which I am also in bonds:">Colossians 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm" title="And I will give her her vineyards from there, and the valley of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out of the land of Egypt.">Hosea 2:15</a>. The apostle’s long abode at Ephesus was owing to his great success in converting the Ephesians, and such strangers as had occasion to resort to that metropolis. But about the time this letter was written, his success was greater than common. For many, who used <span class="ital">curious arts, </span>the arts of magic and divination, were converted, and burned their books, containing the secrets of these arts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-17.htm" title="And this was known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified....">Acts 19:17-20</a>. This so enraged the idolaters at Ephesus, but especially the craftsmen, that they raised the great tumult described <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way....">Acts 19:23-41</a>.” — Macknight. Therefore the apostle adds, <span class="ital">and there are many adversaries </span>— Many opposers, who, (he hereby insinuates,) if he were to leave Ephesus immediately, might perhaps take advantage of his absence, to the great injury of the new-planted church there. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now I will come unto you - I purpose to come unto you. He had expected to see them on his way to Macedonia, but, on some account, had been induced to abandon that design. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-15.htm">2 Corinthians 1:15-17</a>.<p>When I shall pass through Macedonia - When I shall have passed through Macedonia. He proposed to go to Macedonia first, and, having passed through that country, visiting the churches, to go to Corinth. For the situation of Macedonia, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-9.htm">Acts 16:9</a>.<p>For I do pass through Macedonia - I design to do it. It is my present intention. Though he had abandoned, from some cause, the design of passing through Corinth on his way to Macedonia, yet he had not given up the design itself. It was still his intention to go there. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5-7. His first intention had been (2Co 1:15, 16) to pass through them (Corinth) to Macedonia, and again return to them from Macedonia, and so to Judea; this he had announced in the lost epistle (1Co 5:9); now having laid aside this intention (for which he was charged with levity, 2Co 1:17, &c., whereas it was through lenity, 2Co 1:23; 2:1), he announces his second plan of "not seeing them now by the way," but "passing through Macedonia" first on his way to them, and then "tarrying a while," and even "abiding and wintering with them."<p>for I do pass&#8212;as much as to say, "This is what I at last resolve upon" (not as the erroneous subscription of the Epistle represents it, as if he was THEN at Philippi, on his way through Macedonia); implying that there had been some previous communication upon the subject of the journey, and also that there had been some indecisiveness in the apostle's plan [Paley]. In accordance with his second plan, we find him in Macedonia when Second Corinthians was written (2Co 2:13; 8:1; 9:2, 4), and on his way to Corinth (2Co 12:14; 13:1; compare Ac 20:1, 2). "Pass through" is opposed to "abide" (1Co 16:6). He was not yet in Macedonia (as 1Co 16:8 shows), but at Ephesus; but he was thinking of passing through it (not abiding as he purposed to do at Corinth).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-4.htm" title="And if it be meet that I go also, they shall go with me.">1 Corinthians 16:4</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now I will come unto you,....

He had in an Epistle, now lost (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-9.htm">1 Corinthians 5:9</a>), announced to them this intention, he changed his plan because, in the present disgraceful state of disorganization into which the Church had fallen, he felt that he could not visit them without being compelled to exercise a severity which, he hoped, might be obviated by writing to them and delaying his intended visit.
