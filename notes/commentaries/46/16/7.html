It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For I will not see you now by the way - On the way to Macedonia.

Since he does not say <span class="greekheb">πάλιν ἐν παρ</span>., but <span class="greekheb">ἄρτι ἐν παρ</span>., no inference can be drawn from this passage to decide the question (see Introduction to 2 <span class="ital">Cor.</span> § 2) whether Paul had been already <span class="ital">twice</span> in Corinth before writing our Epistle to the Corinthians (in opposition to Schrader, Neander, Wieseler, Otto); but he says simply: <span class="ital">it is not his will now to visit the Corinthians only as a passing traveller</span>, which leaves it quite undecided whether he has already previously visited them once <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρόδῳ</span> (so, too, Hofmann) or not. In order rightly to understand the passage, observe that the <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, which is put first on that account, has the emphasis, in contrast to the Macedonians. The <span class="ital">Corinthians</span>, in the journey which he is now about to make, are to have the advantage over the Macedonians, whom he will only see <span class="ital">in journeying through</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia.">1 Corinthians 16:5</a>.[106] According to Billroth and others, the thought is meant to be, that he will not now see them, <span class="ital">as he had formerly intended</span>, on his journey through (to Macedonia).
