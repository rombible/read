It does not yet seem to have been designated by the phrase by which it became subsequently universally known in Christendom—“the Lord’s Day;” that name occurs first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-10.htm" title="I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet,">Revelation 1:10</a>. This would be a convenient as well as a suitable day for each one to set aside, as he had proposed, something, storing it up until the Apostle’s arrival; for this was already the usual day for Christians assembling themselves together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-7.htm" title="And on the first day of the week, when the disciples came together to break bread, Paul preached to them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.">Acts 20:7</a>). I cannot think with Stanley and others that the Apostle means that each was to lay by “in his own house,” and not in some general treasury. The object of this direction is expressly stated to be that the money should all be ready in bulk-sum when the Apostle came, so that his time and that of the Christian community during his visit might not be occupied with this, but with more profitable matters, which result would not have been accomplished if the offering had then to be gathered from each Christian home.<p><span class= "bld">As God hath prospered him.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">whatsoever he may be prospered in.</span> These words do not imply that only in cases of exceptional prosperity was a man to contribute, but every man was to give out of whatever fruits he had from his labour.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come....">1 Corinthians 16:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Upon the first day of the week </span>— So <span class="greekheb">κατα μιαν σαββατων</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>here signifies, the Hebrews using the numeral for the ordinal numbers, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-5.htm" title="And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night.

Let every one of you</span> <span class="ital">lay by him in store, </span>&c. — Not the rich only: let him also that hath little gladly give of that little, <span class="ital">as God hath prospered him </span>— Increasing his alms as God increases his substance. According to this lowest rule of Christian prudence, if a man, when he has or gains one pound, give a tenth to God, when he has or gains ten pounds, he will give a tenth to God; when he has or gains a hundred, he will give the tenth of this also. “And yet,” says Mr. Wesley, “I show unto you a more excellent way. He that hath ears to hear let him hear: Stint yourself to no proportion at all; but lend to God <span class="ital">all you can.” That there be no gatherings </span>— No necessity of making any particular collections; <span class="ital">when I come — </span>From these last words it is inferred that <span class="greekheb">θησαυριζων</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">laying by him in store, </span>signifies to put his charity into a common box; because, if they had kept it at home, there would have been need of gathering it when the apostle came. But the words <span class="greekheb">εκαστος παρ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">εαυτω τιθετω</span>, <span class="ital">let every one place it with himself, </span>admit not of this sense; nor, when each of them had done this, could there be any necessity of making collections; or, as that expression imports, soliciting the charities of others, but only of receiving the contributions thus laid by for the use of the saints. We may observe here, that from the beginning, the Christians were wont to assemble on the first day of the week, called by them the <span class="ital">Lord’s day, </span>to perform their religious worship. “This day being the Lord’s day,” saith Dionysius, bishop of Corinth, “we keep it holy.” “On Sunday,” saith Justin, “all Christians in the city or country meet together, because that is the day of our Lord’s resurrection; and then we read the writings of the prophets and apostles. This being done, the president makes an oration to the assembly, to exhort them to imitate and do the things they heard: then we all join in prayer, and after that we celebrate the Lord’s supper.” — See Whitby. <span class="ital">And when 1 come </span>— When I am arrived at Corinth; <span class="ital">whomsoever ye shall approve by letters </span>— Signed by the members of your church, or their representatives; <span class="ital">them will I send to bring your liberality </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">την χαριν υμων</span>; literally, <span class="ital">your grace; </span>that is, <span class="ital">the fruit of your grace, </span>or, <span class="ital">your free gift, to Jerusalem, </span>to be there distributed among the poor Christians. <span class="ital">And if it be meet </span>— If it be thought proper; <span class="ital">that I also should go </span>— Thither on this occasion; <span class="ital">they shall go with me </span>— That they may witness for me that no part of the money received has been withheld, but that the whole of it has been delivered with the greatest fidelity, to be employed solely for the purposes for which it was contributed. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:1-9 The good examples of other Christians and churches should rouse us. It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Upon the first day of the week - Greek, "On one of the Sabbaths." The Jews, however, used the word Sabbath to denote the week; the period of seven days; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-1.htm">Matthew 28:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-9.htm">Mark 16:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-12.htm">Luke 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-1.htm">Luke 24:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-1.htm">John 20:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm">Deuteronomy 16:9</a>. It is universally agreed that this here denotes the first day of the week, or the Lord's Day.<p>Let every one of you - Let the collection be universal. Let each one esteem it his duty and his privilege to give to this object. It was not to be confined to the rich only, but was the common duty of all. The poor, as well as the rich, were expected to contribute according to their ability.<p>Lay by him in store - (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1; &#787; &#x3b5;&#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  par' heauto&#772; titheto&#772; the&#772;saurizo&#772;n). Let him lay up at home, treasuring up as he has been prospered. The Greek phrase, "by himself," means, probably, the same as at home. Let him set it apart; let him designate a certain portion; let him do this by himself, when he is at home, when he can calmly look at the evidence of his prosperity. Let him do it not under the influence of pathetic appeals, or for the sake of display when he is with others; but let him do it as a matter of principle, and when he is by himself. The phrase in Greek, "treasuring up," may mean that each one was to put the part which he had designated into the common treasury. This interpretation seems to be demanded by the latter part of the verse. They were to lay it by, and to put it into the common treasury, that there might be no trouble of collecting when he should come. Or it may, perhaps, mean that they were individually to treasure it up, having designated in their own mind the sum which they could give, and have it in readiness when he should come. This was evidently to be done not on one Sunday only, but was to be done on each Lord's Day until he should come.<p>As God hath prospered him - The word "God" is not in the original, but it is evidently understood, and necessary to the sense. The word rendered "hath prospered" (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  euodo&#772;tai) means, properly, to set forward on one's way; to prosper one's journey; and then to prosper, or be prospered. This is the rule which Paul lays down here to guide the Christians at Corinth in giving alms, a rule that is as applicable now, and as valuable now, as it was then.<p>That there be no gatherings when I come - No collections &#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  logiai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>). The apostle means that there should be no trouble in collecting the small sums; that it should all be prepared; that each one might have laid by what he could give; and that all might be ready to be handed over to him, or to whomsoever they might choose to send with it to Jerusalem; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a> - In view of this important verse, we may remark:<p>(1) That there is here clear proof that the first day of the week was observed by the church at Corinth as holy time. If it was not, there can have been no propriety in selecting that day in preference to any other in which to make the collection. It was the day which was set apart to the duties of religion, and therefore an appropriate day for the exercise of charity and the bestowment of alms. There can have been no reason why this day should have been designated except that it was a day set apart to religion, and therefore deemed a proper day for the exercise of benevolence toward others.<p>(2) this order extended also to the churches in Galatia, proving also that the first day of the week was observed by them, and was regarded as a day proper for the exercise of charity toward the poor and the afflicted. And if the first day of the week was observed, by apostolic authority, in those churches, it is morally certain that it was observed by others. This consideration, therefore, demonstrates that it was the custom to observe this day, and that it was observed by the authority of the early founders of Christianity.<p>(3) Paul intended that they should be systematic in their giving, and that they should give from principle, and not merely under the impulse of feeling.<p>(4) Paul designed that the habit of doing good with their money should be constant. He, therefore, directed that it should be on the return of each Lord's Day, and that the subject should be constantly before their minds.<p>(5) it was evident that Paul in this way would obtain more for his object than he would if he waited that they should give all at once. He therefore directed them honestly to lay by each week what they could then give, and to regard it as a sacred treasure. How much would the amount of charities in the Christian churches be swelled if this were the practice now, and if all Christians would lay by in store each week what they could then devote to sacred purposes.<p>(6) the true rule of giving is, "as the Lord hath prospered us." If he has prospered us, we owe it to him as a debt of gratitude. And according to our prosperity and success, we should honestly devote our property to God.<p>(7) it is right and proper to lay by of our wealth for the purposes of benevolence on Sunday. It is right to do good then <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-12.htm">Matthew 12:12</a>; and one of the appropriate exercises of religion is to look at the evidence of our prosperity with a view to know what we may be permitted to give to advance the kingdom of the Lord Jesus.<p>(8) if every Christian would honestly do this every week, it would do much to keep down the spirit of worldliness that now prevails everywhere in the Christian church; and if every Christian would conscientiously follow the direction of Paul here, there would be no lack of funds for any well-directed plan for the conversion of the world. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. first day of &#8230; week&#8212;already kept sacred by Christians as the day of the Lord's resurrection, the beginning day both of the physical and of the new spiritual creations: it gradually superseded the Jewish sabbath on the seventh day (Ps 118:22-24; Joh 20:19, 26; Ac 20:7; Re 1:10). So the beginning of the year was changed from autumn to spring when Israel was brought out of Egypt. Three annual feasts, all typical of Christian truths, were directed to be kept on the first day of the week: the feast of the wave offering of the first sheaf, answering to the Lord's resurrection; Pentecost, or the feast of weeks, typical of the fruits of the resurrection in the Christian Church (Le 23:11, 15, 16, 36); the feast of tabernacles at harvest, typical of the ingathering of the full number of the elect from one end of heaven to the other. Easter was directed to be kept as a holy sabbath (Ex 12:16). The Christian Sabbath commemorates the respective works of the Three Persons of the Triune God&#8212;creation, redemption (the resurrection), and sanctification (on Pentecost the Holy Ghost being poured out). Jesus came to fulfil the Spirit of the Law, not to cancel it, or to lower its standard. The primary object of the sabbath is holiness, not merely rest: "Remember that thou keep holy the sabbath day." Compare Ge 2:3, "God blessed and sanctified it, because &#8230; in it He had rested," &c. The word "Remember" implies that it was in existence before the giving of the law from Sinai, and refers to its institution in Paradise (compare Ex 16:22, 23, 26, 30). "Six days shalt thou labor": the spirit of the command is fulfilled whether the six days' labor be on the last six days or on the first. A perpetual sabbath would doubtless be the highest Christian ideal; but living in a world of business where the Christian ideal is not yet realized, if a law of definite times was necessary in Paradise, it is still more so now.<p>every one of yon&#8212;even those in limited circumstances.<p>lay by him&#8212;though there be not a weekly public collection, each is privately to set apart a definite proportion of his weekly income for the Lord's cause and charity.<p>in store&#8212;abundantly: the earnest of a better store laid up for the giver (1Ti 6:19).<p>as God hath prospered him&#8212;literally, "whatsoever he may be prospered in," or "may by prosperity have acquired" [Alford], (Mt 25:15-29; 2Co 8:12).<p>that there be no gatherings when I come&#8212;that they may not then have to be made, when your and my time ought to be employed m more directly spiritual things. When men give once for all, not so much is given. But when each lays by something every Lord's day, more is collected than one would have given at once [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> From hence both divers of the ancients, and very many late divines, argue for the change of the sabbath from the seventh day of the week to the first. It is plain from hence, that the gospel churches were wont to assemble upon that day; nor do we read in Scripture of any assembly of Christians for religious worship on any other day. On this day the apostle orders collections for the poor saints to be made, accordingly as God had prospered any in their employments; he directeth that they should every one lay by him something, not doing what he did with any ostentation, but having it ready when it should be called for: this he calls a treasuring (so it is in the Greek); monies laid by for charitable uses are treasures, both with respect to those for whom they are laid up, and also for ourselves; for he that giveth to the poor, layeth up for himself treasures in heaven. He would have <span class="ital">no gatherings when</span> he came, either to avoid the scandal of his being chargeable to them, or that he would have no delay, but when he came it might be in a readiness to be presently sent away. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Upon the first day of the week,.... In an ancient copy of Beza's, and in some others, it is added, "the Lord's day". Upon some one first day of the week, or more, if there was a necessity for it, until the collection was finished; though the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "every first day": but this is not the apostle's intention, that a collection should be made every first day, but only on some one day, or as long as it was necessary: for at the close of the verse he gives this reason for it, "that there be no gatherings when I:come": whereas, if this collection was to have been every first day, and to have been always continued, it must have been when he was present, as well as when absent; but this was only designed for a certain time, and on a certain account: the reason of his fixing upon the first day of the week was, because on this day the disciples of Christ, and the primitive churches, met together for divine worship, to hear the word, and observe the ordinances of Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm">John 20:19</a> and was a very fit reason for such a work, when their hearts were warmed with the presence of God and Christ, with the grace of the Spirit, and the doctrines of the Gospel, and their affections were knit to one another, and to all the saints: and so we find from the accounts of Justin Martyr (w), and of Tertullian (x), that it was usual for the primitive churches in the age following that of the apostles, after the worship of God was over, to collect money for widows and orphans, and for saints in distress, such as were banished into distant parts, or condemned to the mines; and this practice was very agreeable to the customs of the apostle's countrymen, the Jews, from whence he might take this, who used to collect for, and distribute to the poor on their sabbath (y). <p>"The alms dish was every day, but the alms chest from evening of the sabbath to the evening of the sabbath,'' <p>It was collected and distributed then, as their commentators say (z). <p>Let everyone of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him. The persons who are to contribute are everyone, of every sex, age, state, and condition, male and female, young and old, servants and masters, the meaner as well as the richer sort; the poor widow threw in her mite into the treasury as well as the rich men: the act of communication or distribution is signified by laying by him in store; for this is not to be understood of separating a part of his substance from the rest, and laying it up  "in his own house", as the Syriac version renders it, or the putting it in his pocket in order to give it; though both these acts may be necessary, as preparatory to the work: but it intends the very act itself: for communicating to the poor is laying up in store a good foundation for the time to come; it is a laying up treasure in heaven, and riches there, which will never corrupt: the manner in which this is to be done, and the measure of it, "as God hath prospered him"; according to the success he has in his worldly business, and the increase of his worldly substance, and which is the way to have it enlarged. The Jews have a saying (a), <p>"if a man observes his provisions to be straitened, let him do alms of them, how much more if they are large.'' <p>The Vulgate Latin version renders, it, "laying up what pleases him well"; and the Arabic version, "what through liberality he pleases, and shall be convenient for him"; for this ought to be a freewill offering, as a matter of bounty and generosity, and not of covetousness, or of force and necessity, but as a man, of himself has purposed in his own heart, and which he does with cheerfulness and freedom. <p>That there be no gatherings when I come; who had other work, and greater service to do among them; besides, he was desirous of having this collection over and ready when he came, that he might directly send it away to Jerusalem, knowing the pressing necessities of the saints there. <p>(w) Apolog. 2. p. 98, 99.

But though it is clear enough, from the universal consent of Christians, that they were accustomed to meet together for worship on the Lord’s Day, we cannot infer it from this passage.

Wiclif and Tyndale have <span class="ital">gathering</span> in both places. The rendering in the text is Tyndale’s.
