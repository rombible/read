Now that he knows how very bad is the condition of the Corinthian Church, and what need it has of vigorous treatment, he sends not only his Epistle, but with it Titus and two other brethren. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-18.htm" title="And we have sent with him the brother, whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches;">2Corinthians 8:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/8-22.htm" title="And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes proved diligent in many things, but now much more diligent, on the great confidence which I have in you.">2Corinthians 8:22-23</a>.) In energy and firmness of character Titus was a striking contrast to Timothy, while he equally shared the spirit and confidence of St. Paul. (See <span class= "ital">Introduction,</span> and 2 Corinthians 7, 8) He therefore was not only a bearer of this Epistle, but one fully competent and willing to deal energetically with the recalcitrant spirit of some sections of the Corinthian Church. The Apostle here expresses the hope that Timothy may join Titus and his party when they take their departure from Corinth.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:10-12 Timothy came to do the work of the Lord. Therefore to vex his spirit, would be to grieve the Holy Spirit; to despise him, would be to despise Him that sent him. Those who work the work of the Lord, should be treated with tenderness and respect. Faithful ministers will not be jealous of each other. It becomes the ministers of the gospel to show concern for each other's reputation and usefulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man, therefore, despise him - Let no one despise him on account of his youth and inexperience. It is probable that some of the more wealthy and proud, some who valued themselves on their wisdom and experience, would be disposed to look upon him with contempt. On another occasion, he directed Timothy so to live as that no one should have occasion to despise him on account of his youth <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; and he here urges on the Corinthians, that they should not despise him because be was a young man, and comparatively inexperienced. A minister of the gospel, though young, should receive the respect that is due to his office; and if he conducts himself in accordance with his high calling, his youth should be no barrier to the confidence and affection of even aged and experienced Christians. It should be rather a reason why they should treat him with affection, and encourage him in his work.<p>But conduct him forth in peace - That is, when he leaves you. Attend him on his way, and help him forward on his journey to me; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>.<p>For I look for him with the brethren - Erastus accompanied Timothy in this journey <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a>, and probably there were others with him. Titus also had been sent to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2.htm">1 Corinthians 2</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-17.htm">1 Corinthians 12:17-18</a>, and it is not improbable that Paul had desired Titus to bring with him to Ephesus some of the Corinthian brethren, as he might need their assistance there - Grotius. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. despise&#8212;This charge is not given concerning any other of the many messengers whom Paul sent. 1Ti 4:12 accounts for it (compare Ps 119:141). He was a young man, younger probably than those usually employed in the Christian missions; whence Paul apprehending lest he should, on that account, be exposed to contempt, cautions him, "Let no man despise thy youth" [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;].<p>conduct&#8212;set him on his way with every mark of respect, and with whatever he needs (Tit 3:13).<p>in peace&#8212;(Ac 15:33; Heb 11:31). "Peace" is the salutation of kindness and respect in the East; and so it stands for every blessing. Perhaps here there is too a contrast between "peace" and the "contentions" prevalent at Corinth (1Co 1:11).<p>I look for him&#8212;He and Titus were appointed to meet Paul in Troas, whither the apostle purposed proceeding from Ephesus (2Co 2:12, 13). Paul thus claims their respect for Timothy as one whom he felt so necessary to himself as "look for" to him [Theophylact].<p>with the brethren&#8212;Others besides Erastus accompanied Timothy to Macedonia (compare 1Co 16:12; Ac 19:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let no man therefore despise him; </span> either because he is a very young man, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1 Timothy 4:12</a></span>, or upon any other account. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But conduct him forth in peace, that he may come unto me; </span> but when he cometh away, show him the respect you use to show me, conduct him in his way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For I look for him with the brethren; </span> for I have need of his help here, in carrying on the business of the gospel; and therefore I, with the brethren here, expect him; or, I expect him with the rest of the brethren, who are in like manner employed abroad in carrying about the gospel. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let no man therefore despise him,....

There was a reason for adding this. The Corinthians would see that any unkindness or contempt shown towards Timothy would at once be reported to St. Paul. Who "the brethren" are is not mentioned, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-22.htm">Acts 19:22</a> we are only told that Timothy was accompanied by Erastus. Perhaps St. Paul means with the brethren who conveyed this letter (see ver. 12), and who, as he supposed, would meet with Timothy at Corinth, or fall in with him on their return to meet St. Paul in Macedonia. One of these brethren must have been Titus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-13.htm">2 Corinthians 2:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm">2 Corinthians 7:6, 7</a>), and there were two others. </body></html>
