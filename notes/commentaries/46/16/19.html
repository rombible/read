Religion should promote a courteous and obliging temper towards all. Those give a false idea of religion, and reproach it, who would take encouragement from it to be sour and morose. And Christian salutations are not mere empty compliments; but are real expressions of good-will to others, and commend them to the Divine grace and blessing. Every Christian family should be as a Christian church. Wherever two or three are gathered together in the name of Christ, and he is among them, there is a church. Here is a solemn warning. Many who have Christ's name much in their mouths, have no true love to him in their hearts. None love him in truth, who do not love his laws, and keep his commandments. Many are Christians in name, who do not love Christ Jesus the Lord in sincerity. Such are separated from the people of God, and the favour of God. Those who love not the Lord Jesus Christ, must perish without remedy. Let us not rest in any religious profession where there is not the love of Christ, earnest desires for his salvation, gratitude for his mercies, and obedience to his commandments. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ has in it all that is good, for time and for eternity. To wish that our friends may have this grace with them, is wishing them the utmost good. And this we should wish all our friends and brethren in Christ. We can wish them nothing greater, and we should wish them nothing less. True Christianity makes us wish those whom we love, the blessings of both worlds; this is meant in wishing the grace of Christ to be with them. The apostle had dealt plainly with the Corinthians, and told them of their faults with just severity; but he parts in love, and with a solemn profession of his love to them for Christ's sake. May our love be with all who are in Christ Jesus. Let us try whether all things appear worthless to us, when compared with Christ and his righteousness. Do we allow ourselves in any known sin, or in the neglect of any known duty? By such inquiries, faithfully made, we may judge of the state of our souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The churches of Asia - The word "Asia" in the New Testament usually denotes Asia Minor in general; see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-9.htm">Acts 2:9</a>.

Asia&#8212;not all Asia Minor, but Lydian Asia only, of which Ephesus was the capital.<p>much&#8212;with especial affection.<p>Aquila &#8230; Priscilla&#8212;(Compare Ac 18:2; Ro 16:3, 4). Originally driven out of Italy by Claudius, they had come to Corinth (whence their salutation of the Corinthians is appropriate here), and then had removed with Paul from Corinth to Ephesus (Ac 18:2, 18, 19, 26); here, as at Rome subsequently, they set up a Church (or assembly of believers) at their house (Ro 16:3, 5). A pattern to Christian husbands and wives. Their Christian self-devoting love appears wherever they were (Ro 16:3, 4). Even the gifted Apollos, so highly admired at Corinth, owed much of his knowledge to them (Ac 18:24-26). In 1Co 16:20, "All the brethren" (that is, the whole Church) seem to be distinguished from "the church that is in their house," which was but a partial and private assembly out of the general Church at Corinth. Neander thinks Ro 16:23 refers to "the whole Church" meeting at the house of Gaius (compare Col 4:15). "Synagogue" implies an assembly in general, without reference to the character or motives of its members. "Church," like the Hebrew Kahal, implies an assembly legally convened; as, for instance, the Jews met as a body politic to receive the law (hence Stephen calls it "the Church in the wilderness," Ac 7:38), and having a legal bond of union. Christ's followers when dispersed from one another cease to be a congregation (synagogue), but still are a Church, having the common bond of union to the same Head by the same faith and hope [Vitringa, Synagogue and Temple]. From this we may explain Paul's entering "into every house and haling men and women": he would in searching for Christians go to their several "houses"' of prayer.<p>in the Lord&#8212;They pray for all blessings on you from the Lord, the source of every good [Grotius]. Alford explains, "in a Christian manner," as mindful of your common Lord. "In the Lord" seems to me to refer to their union together in Christ, their prayers for one another's good being in virtue of that union.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He meaneth the Lesser Asia, in which was Ephesus; from whence it is more probable (according to the Arabic and Syriac opinion) that this Epistle was written, than from Philippi (according to the copy followed by our translaters). And that which further adds to that probability is, that the apostle mentioneth the salutations of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Aquila and Priscilla, </span> as persons that were at that time with him; now, that they lived at Ephesus, or at least went thither with Paul, and tarried there, appeareth from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-19.htm" title="And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.">Acts 18:19</a></span>: their saluting the church of Corinth <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the Lord, </span> signifies their wishing them all spiritual blessings in and from Christ. But what is meant by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the church in their house, </span> which joined with Paul in this salutation, is not so plain: we read the like, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-15.htm" title=" Salute the brothers which are in Laodicea, and Nymphas, and the church which is in his house.">Colossians 4:15</a></span>, of the church in Nymphas’s house; and in Philemon’s house, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-2.htm" title="And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house:">Philemon 1:2</a></span>; and the same again of this Aquila and Priscilla, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-5.htm" title="Likewise greet the church that is in their house.

Some think that it signifieth no more, than that their whole families had received the Christian faith; others think, that divers other Christians sojourned with them; others, that the church was wont to meet in some room in their house: but the last is not probable, either that in those times the church kept their meetings in any one stated place, or that Christians then had such spacious houses as could afford a room large enough for the whole church to meet in. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The churches of Asia salute you,.... The Syriac version renders it, "all" the churches.

These came to Corinth, where they met with the apostle; and being of the same occupation, stayed and wrought with him; and when he went from thence to Ephesus, accompanied him thither; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm">Acts 18:3</a>; wherefore having personal knowledge of the members of this church, through their stay with the apostle there, for the space of a year and a half, send their Christian salutations to them, with great affection and respect: <p>with the church that is in their house: their family consisting of believers, and being kept in such good decorum, and employed daily in singing, praying, expounding, and conferring together about divine things, looked like a little church; and it may be that at certain times the principal members of the church at Ephesus met in their house for religious worship, and to consider and debate about the affairs of the church; and very likely as they were of the same occupation with the apostle, he himself dwelt here; and which might be the more an occasion of the church assembling here at times; and the Vulgate Latin version adds, "with whom also I lodge". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The churches of Asia salute you.

The word is the Aramaic <span class="greekheb">מָרָנָא אֲתָא</span> , i.e. our Lord is come, by which, however, not the coming in the flesh is meant, as Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Jerome, Erasmus, Castalio, al., assume,[112] but, in accordance with the context (see previously <span class="greekheb">ἤτω ἀνάθ</span>.), the <span class="ital">eschatological</span> coming to judgment. Paul sees the near and certain Parousia as if already begun (see on this use of the Hebrew praeterite, Ewald, <span class="ital">Lehrb</span>. 135. 3), and exclaims, like a prophet beholding it in vision: <span class="ital">Our Lord is here!</span> But it is not a <span class="ital">form of putting under ban</span> (see Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Hor.</span> p. 260), as indeed it does not occur in the Rabbinical writings; Luther (comp. Calvin) has without any warrant made it into <span class="ital">Maharam Motha</span> (which would be <span class="greekheb">מחרם מותא</span> , <span class="ital">maledictus ad mortem</span>). According to Hofmann, <span class="greekheb">μαραναθά</span> is meant to be equivalent to <span class="greekheb">מַר אַנְתָה</span> , <span class="ital">Thou art the Lord</span>, whereby the thought is expressed: “<span class="ital">He will prove Himself in them to be Lord</span>.” But how needless is this wholly novel and far less characteristic interpretation! The traditional interpretation,[113] on the other hand, places the <span class="ital">punishment of the judgment</span> directly before our eyes. Why, we may ask further, did Paul use the <span class="ital">Aramaean</span> expression? We do not know. Perhaps there was implied in it some reminiscence from the time of the apostle’s presence among them, unknown to us, but carrying weight for his readers; perhaps it was only the prompting of momentary indignation, that, after the sentence of judgment already pronounced (<span class="greekheb">ἤτω ἀνάθεμα</span>), “rei gravitate commotus, quasi sibi non satisfecisset” (Calvin), he desired to clothe in truly solemn language the threatening reference to the Parousia yet to be added by <span class="greekheb">μαραναθά</span>, instead of saying <span class="greekheb">ὁ κύριος ἡμῶν ἥκει</span>. That there was a reference, however, in the Aramaean expression to the <span class="ital">Petrine party</span> who understood Hebrew, is not to be assumed (in opposition to Hofmann), as the general <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις οὐ φιλεῖ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κύριον</span> shows of itself. The two Aramaean words were doubtless enough intelligible generally in the mixed church, which contained so much of the Jewish element. Had the <span class="ital">Maranatha</span>, however, been as it were the <span class="ital">mysterious watchword</span> in the world of that time (Ewald), there would be in all probability more traces of it to be found in the New Testament. This also in opposition to Bengel. The view of Chrysostom and Theophylact is singularly absurd: Paul wished by the Aramaean to cross the conceit of the Corinthians in the Hellenic language and wisdom. Billroth, followed by Rückert, holds that he had added something in Aramaic also, in order to accredit yet more strongly the authenticity of the Epistle, but that this had afterwards been written by the transcribers in Greek letters. But the assumption that he had <span class="ital">not</span> written <span class="greekheb">μαραναθά</span> in Greek letters, although it has passed over so into all Greek MSS. of the text, is equally arbitrary with the presupposition that he had thought such an <span class="ital">extraordinary</span> and <span class="ital">peculiar</span> mode of attestation to be needful precisely in the case of this Epistle, which was already sufficiently accredited without it by the bearers.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-23.htm" title="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.">1 Corinthians 16:23</a>. <span class="ital">The grace of the Lord</span>, etc., <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">εἴη</span>, the apostle’s most common closing wish in an epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm" title="And the God of peace shall bruise Satan under your feet shortly.
