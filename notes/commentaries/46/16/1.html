The salutation of Paul himself.<p>From the fact of a necessity existing for a collection for the poor Christians at Jerusalem, it is clear that the community of goods (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm" title="And all that believed were together, and had all things common;">Acts 2:44</a>) which had at the beginning been established in that Church had not proved successful. Christianity was largely recruited from the lower classes, especially in Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you, and draw you before the judgment seats?">James 2:6</a>), and a common fund would not long have flourished with so few contributors and such a multitude of sharers. Moreover, the many who were shut up in prison had perhaps by this time been released in abject poverty, and would naturally be the subject of anxious solicitation to one who was identical with “persecuting Saul,” who “had given his voice against them,” and against others now dead. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-10.htm" title="Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.">Acts 26:10</a>.) It is to be noticed that the Apostle does not speak of them as “the poor,” but as “saints.” That was the true ground of their claim upon their brethren.<p><span class= "bld">As I have given order to the churches of Galatia.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">As</span> <span class= "ital">I</span> <span class= "ital">gave order to the churches of Galatia.</span> The order was definitely given by the Apostle in person when visiting these churches (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>). It does not occur in his Epistle to that Church.

But the divisions in their church, it seems, had hitherto hindered them from beginning it. The apostle therefore here requests them to set about it immediately, and directs them as to the mode of proceeding. The saints in Judea were, it appears, at this time, in great straits, both on account of a famine, and the persecution to which they were exposed. <span class="ital">As I have given order, or a charge, </span>Greek, <span class="greekheb">διεταξα</span>, <span class="ital">to the churches of Galatia </span>— It is probable the apostle gave these orders to the churches of Galatia when he went throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, establishing the churches, as mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6</a>.

It is good to lay up in store for good uses. Those who are rich in this world, should be rich in good works, 1Ti 6:17,18. The diligent hand will not make rich, without the Divine blessing, Pr 10:4,22. And what more proper to stir us up to charity to the people and children of God, than to look at all we have as his gift? Works of mercy are real fruits of true love to God, and are therefore proper services on his own day. Ministers are doing their proper business, when putting forward, or helping works of charity. The heart of a Christian minister must be towards the people among whom he has laboured long, and with success. All our purposes must be made with submission to the Divine providence, Jas 4:15. Adversaries and opposition do not break the spirits of faithful and successful ministers, but warm their zeal, and inspire them with fresh courage. A faithful minister is more discouraged by the hardness of his hearers' hearts, and the backslidings of professors, than by the enemies' attempts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now concerning the collection for the saints - The use of the article here shows that he had mentioned it to them before, and that it was a subject which they would readily understand. It was not new to them, but it was needful only to give some instructions in regard to the manner in which it should be done, and not in regard to the occasion for the collection, or the duty of making it. Accordingly, all his instructions relate simply to the manner in which the collection should be made. The word rendered "collection" (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  logia) does not occur anywhere else in the New Testament, and is not found in the classic writers. It is from &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;  lego&#772;, to collect, and, undoubtedly, here refers to a contribution, or collection of money for a charitable purpose. The word "saints" (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  hagious) here refers, doubtless, to "Christians;" to the persecuted Christians in Judea. There were many there; and they were generally poor, and exposed to various trials. In regard to the meaning of this word, and the circumstances and occasion of this collection; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-25.htm">Romans 15:25-26</a>.<p>As I have given order - (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b1;  dietaxa). As I have directed, enjoined, commanded, arranged. It does not mean that he had assumed the authority to tax them, or that he had commanded them to make a collection, but that he had left directions as to the best manner and time in which it should be done. The collection was voluntary and cheerful in all the churches <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; and Paul did not assume authority to impose it on them as a tax. Nor was it necessary. Self-denial and liberality were among the distinguishing virtues of the early Christians; and to be a Christian then implied that a man would freely impart of his property to aid the poor and the needy. The order related solely to the manner of making the collection; and as Paul had suggested one mode to the churches in Galatia, he recommended the same now to the Corinthians.<p>To the churches of Galatia - Galatia was a province in Asia Minor. On its situation, see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. There were evidently several churches planted in that region; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-2.htm">Galatians 1:2</a>. At what time he gave this order to the churches there is not mentioned; though it was doubtless on occasion of a visit to the churches there; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 16<p>1Co 16:1-24.

Salutations and Conclusions.<p>1. collection for the saints&#8212;at Jerusalem (Ro 15:26) and in Judea (Ac 11:29, 30; 24:17; compare 2Co 8:4; 9:1, 12). He says "saints" rather than "the poor," to remind the Corinthians that in giving, it is to the Lord's people, their own brethren in the faith. Towards the close of the national existence of the Jews, Judea and Jerusalem were harassed with various troubles, which in part affected the Jewish Christians. The community of goods which existed among them for a time gave temporary relief but tended ultimately to impoverish all by paralyzing individual exertion (Ac 2:44), and hence was soon discontinued. A beautiful fruit of grace it was, that he who had by persecutions robbed many of their all (Ac 26:10), should become the foremost in exertions for their relief.<p>as I have given&#8212;rather, "gave order," namely, during my journey through Galatia, that mentioned in Ac 18:23. The churches of Galatia and Phrygia were the last which Paul visited before writing this Epistle. He was now at Ephesus, and came thither immediately from visiting them (Ac 18:23; 19:1). That he had not been silent in Galatia on contributions for the poor, appears from the hint let fall in his Epistle to that church (Ga 2:10): an undesigned coincidence and mark of genuineness [Paley, Hor&aelig; Paulin&aelig;]. He proposes the Galatians as an example to the Corinthians, the Corinthians to the Macedonians, the Corinthians and Macedonians to the Romans (Ro 15:26, 27; 2Co 9:2). There is great force in example.<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you....">1 Corinthians 16:1-4</a></span> Paul directeth the Corinthians how to proceed in<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>their collections for the relief of the brethren at<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Jerusalem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-5.htm" title="Now I will come to you, when I shall pass through Macedonia: for I do pass through Macedonia....">1 Corinthians 16:5-9</a></span> He mentioneth his design of visiting them,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-10.htm" title="Now if Timotheus come, see that he may be with you without fear: for he works the work of the Lord, as I also do....">1 Corinthians 16:10-12</a></span> and commendeth Timothy, who was coming to them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-13.htm" title="Watch you, stand fast in the faith, quit you like men, be strong....">1 Corinthians 16:13-18</a></span> After some seasonable admonitions,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

The churches of Galatia and Macedonia had been very liberal this way; and the apostle, by their example, quickens the churches both at Rome and Corinth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-4.htm" title="Praying us with much entreaty that we would receive the gift, and take on us the fellowship of the ministering to the saints.">2 Corinthians 8:4</a></span>.

Not at Corinth, but at Jerusalem, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a> for the poor saints there, who were reduced to poverty, either through the spoiling of their goods by their persecuting countrymen; or through the selling of their possessions, and putting their substance into one common stock, which was now exhausted, partly by their living upon it, and partly by the expending of it for the enlargement of the interest of Christ, and the spread of his Gospel among the Gentiles; so that it was but fit and reasonable that they should assist them in their necessitous circumstances: wherefore the apostle, after he had gone through the various subjects he thought fit to write upon, relating both to doctrine and practice, proceeds to give some orders, directions, and instructions, concerning this matter. <p>As I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, so also do ye. The churches of Galatia were those he wrote an epistle to, which bears their name, and in which he takes notice of the request of the apostles at Jerusalem to him, that he would remember the poor as he travelled through the Gentile countries, and which, no doubt, he mentions, as a hint unto them to collect for them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a> though the order he here speaks of was doubtless given them when he passed through the region of Galatia, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-6.htm">Acts 16:6</a>. This he observes by way of example to the church at Corinth, and to show them, that what he ordered them was no other than what he enjoined other churches, and which they were ready to come into, as these in Galatia, and also in Macedonia; and designs this as a spur unto them, that if the Galatians, who were a more rude and uncultivated people, being now called by grace, were ready to such a good work, they who were a more polite people, and used to civility, humanity, and tenderness, would not be backward to it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now concerning <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</span><p>(1) Collections in ancient times were made by the appointment of the apostle appointment to be the first day of the week, on which day the manner was then to assemble themselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>.

Rückert’s view (comp. also Olshausen), that Paul desired to appease the minds of the Jewish Christians there which were embittered against him, before he journeyed into the west, has no trace whatever of its existence either in the Acts or the Epistles.

CONCERNING THE COLLECTION. During his Third Missionary Journey P. was collecting money for the relief of the Christian poor in Jerusalem. Two chaps. in the middle of 2 Cor. are devoted to this business, which, as it seems, had moved slowly in the interval between the two Epp. The collection had been set on foot some time ago in Galatia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>); in Macedonia it had been warmly taken up (2 Corinthians 8 f.); from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-4.htm" title="And there accompanied him into Asia Sopater of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus; and of Asia, Tychicus and Trophimus.">Acts 20:4</a> we learn that “Asians” also (from Ephesus and the neighbourhood) accompanied P. in the deputation which conveyed the Gentile offering to the mother Church. A little later, in writing to Rome (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-25.htm" title="For he must reign, till he has put all enemies under his feet....">1 Corinthians 15:25-32</a>), the Ap. refers to the collection, with great satisfaction, as completed. Every province of the Pauline mission appears to have aided in this charity, which, while it relieved a distressing need, was prompted also by Paul’s warm love for his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm" title="For I could wish that myself were accursed from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh:">Romans 9:3</a>), and by his desire to knit together the Gentile and Jewish sections of the Church, and to prove to the latter the true faith and brotherhood of the converts from heathenism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="Being enriched in every thing to all bountifulness, which causes through us thanksgiving to God....">2 Corinthians 9:11-14</a>). P. had taken part in a similar relief sent from Antioch many years before (Acts 11 f.); and in the Conference of Jerus., when the direction of the Gentile mission was committed to him, the heads of the Judæan Church laid on him the injunction to “remember the poor” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a>). Foreign Jews were accustomed, as an act of piety, to replenish the poorfunds of the mother city. The Christian community of Jerus. suffered from chronic poverty. With little natural or commercial wealth, the city lived mainly upon its religious character—on the attractions of the Temple and the Feasts thronged by Jews from the whole world; and the Nazarenes, while suffering from the intense bigotry of their compatriots in other ways, would find it esp. difficult to participate in employments connected with religion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a> intimates that the Judæan Churches had recently undergone severe persecution.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you....">1 Corinthians 16:1-24</a>. Sundry practical directions. Conclusion<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Now concerning the collection for the saints</span>] i.e. ‘the poor saints (see note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-2.htm" title="To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and our's:">1 Corinthians 1:2</a>) at Jerusalem,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>. The same subject is mentioned in ch. 8, 9 of the second Epistle. The disorganized state of Judaea at this time, as described in the pages of Josephus, may account for the systematic efforts which were then being made throughout the Gentile Churches for their aid. This collection is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>, written after the Apostle’s arrival at Corinth. Another reason for this Gentile liberality is given there. Jerusalem was the source whence all the blessings of the Gospel had flowed. It was fitting that some recompence, however inadequate, should be made. Cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-11.htm" title="If we have sown to you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?">1 Corinthians 9:11</a>. St Paul says here that he had instructed the Galatian Churches to send their contribution, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm" title="Only they would that we should remember the poor; the same which I also was forward to do.">Galatians 2:10</a> we find that it was a special matter of agreement between himself and the other Apostles that he should ‘remember the poor,’ i.e. of the Church at Jerusalem. St Luke does not mention the collection in its proper place in the Acts, but the incidental reference to it in a speech made long after by the Apostle, and recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm" title="Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.">Acts 24:17</a>, is adduced by Paley in his <span class="ital">Horae Paulinae</span>, as a remarkable instance of undesigned agreement between this Epistle and the narrative in the Acts, and as strong evidence of the authenticity of both.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as I have given order</span>] Rather, <span class="ital">as I</span> <span class="bld">gave</span> <span class="ital">order</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to the churches of Galatia</span>] Hardly in the visit recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-23.htm" title="And after he had spent some time there, he departed, and went over all the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.">Acts 18:23</a>, for (though (see Paley, <span class="ital">Horae Paulinae</span>) they are the last Churches recorded to have been visited), that visit took place nearly three years previously (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-31.htm" title="Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.">Acts 20:31</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-10.htm" title="And this continued by the space of two years; so that all they which dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.">Acts 19:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/19-21.htm" title="After these things were ended, Paul purposed in the spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome....">Acts 19:21-22</a>), but in some short visit not recorded, or by letter or message. The Corinthians had received their instructions a year before the date of the second Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="And herein I give my advice: for this is expedient for you, who have begun before, not only to do, but also to be forward a year ago.">2 Corinthians 8:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>), and therefore several months before the first was written.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/16.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λογίας</span>, <span class="ital">collection</span>) A plain [not figurative] term well adapted to the commencement of this subject, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm" title="On the first day of the week let every one of you lay by him in store, as God has prospered him, that there be no gatherings when I come.">1 Corinthians 16:2</a> : it is called <span class="ital">a blessing</span>,[153] <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Therefore I thought it necessary to exhort the brothers, that they would go before to you, and make up beforehand your bounty, whereof you had notice before, that the same might be ready, as a matter of bounty, and not as of covetousness.">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τοὺς ἁγίους</span>, <span class="ital">for the saints</span>) He would rather call them <span class="ital">the saints</span> than <span class="ital">the poor;</span> and he does so both because this appellation is suited to the importance of the object and fitted for obtaining it.—<span class="greekheb">διέταξα</span>, <span class="ital">I have given order</span>) by apostolic authority, which was familiar to the <span class="ital">Galatians</span>.—<span class="greekheb">Γαλατίας</span>, <span class="ital">of Galatia</span>) He proposes the Galatians as an example to the Corinthians, the Corinthians to the Macedonians, the Corinthians and Macedonians to the Romans: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-2.htm" title="For I know the forwardness of your mind, for which I boast of you to them of Macedonia, that Achaia was ready a year ago; and your zeal has provoked very many.">2 Corinthians 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>.

The subject weighed much on St. Paul's mind. First, there was real need for their charity, for at Jerusalem there was as sharp a contrast between the lots of the rich and poor as there is in London, and the "poor saints," being the poorest of the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a>), must have often been in deep distress. Not many years before this time, in the famine of Claudius, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-27.htm">Acts 11:27-30</a>), Queen Helena of Adiabene had kept the paupers of Jerusalem alive by importing cargoes of dried grapes and figs. Besides the periodical famines, the political troubles of Judaea had recently increased the general distress. Secondly, the tender heart of St. Paul was keenly alive to this distress. Thirdly, it was the only way in which the Gentile Churches could show their gratitude to the mother Church. Lastly, the Apostle St. Paul had solemnly promised the apostles at Jerusalem that he would remember the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-10.htm">Galatians 2:10</a>). Hence he frequently alludes to this collection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8.htm">2 Corinthians 8, 9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>, etc.). The enthusiastic communism of the earliest Christian society in Jerusalem had soon ceased, being, as all experience proves, an impossible experiment under the conditions which regulate all human life, and it may have aggravated the chronic distress. <span class="cmt_word">As I have given order;</span> rather, <span class="accented">as I arranged.<span class="cmt_word"></span> To the Churches of Galatia.</span> Not in his extant letter to the Galatians, but either in a visit three years before this time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-28.htm">Acts 18:28</a>), or by letter. It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-10.htm">2 Corinthians 8:10</a> that St. Paul had already asked for the contributions of the Corinthians. "To the Corinthians he proposes the example of the Galatians; to the Macedonians the example of the Corinthians; to the Romans that of the Macedonians and Corinthians. Great is the power of example" (Bengel). <span class="cmt_word">Even so do ye.</span> The aorist implies that they should do it at once. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/16.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Collection (&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Peculiar to the New Testament, and occurring only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-2.htm">1 Corinthians 16:2</a>.

From &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9; to collect. For such material ministries Paul uses a variety of words; as &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; bounty, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-3.htm">1 Corinthians 16:3</a>; &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; contribution, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. blessing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-5.htm">2 Corinthians 9:5</a>; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; ministration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm">2 Corinthians 9:12</a>; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; alms, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-17.htm">Acts 24:17</a>.

Evidently the community of property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-44.htm">Acts 2:44</a>) had been abandoned; and Augustine supposes that the poverty of the Jerusalem Christians was due to that practice. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>. The precise causes of the destitution in that church can be only conjectured. </body></html>
