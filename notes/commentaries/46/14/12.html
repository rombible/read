The word for “spiritual gifts” is, in the Greek, literally <span class= "ital">spirits,</span> but is evidently meant to imply the gifts, and especially that one under consideration—the gift of tongues.<p><span class= "bld">Seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">seek, then, to the edifying of the Church, that ye may abound.</span> The point cannot be that they were to seek to excel in spiritual gifts, that so they might edify the Church, for the next verse explains how the gift is to be sought so that it may edify others; but the force of the passage here is as given above—they are to seek this gift for the benefit of others, and so they will themselves, by serving others, abound yet more and more (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled.">1Corinthians 8:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more.">1Thessalonians 4:1</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:6-14 Even an apostle could not edify, unless he spoke so as to be understood by his hearers. To speak words that have no meaning to those who hear them, is but speaking into the air. That cannot answer the end of speaking, which has no meaning; in this case, speaker and hearers are barbarians to each other. All religious services should be so performed in Christian assemblies, that all may join in, and profit by them. Language plain and easy to be understood, is the most proper for public worship, and other religious exercises. Every true follower of Christ will rather desire to do good to others, than to get a name for learning or fine speaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even so ye - Since you desire spiritual gifts, I may urge it upon you to seek to he able to speak in a clear and intelligible manner, that you may edify the church.

The absurdity referred to is meant to point the readers, with their zealous striving after gifts of the Spirit, to the right way, namely, that <span class="ital">with a view to the edification of the church</span>[6] they should seek after ever richer endowments.

The <span class="ital">plural</span> expression is <span class="ital">purposely chosen</span> <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τὸ φαινόμενον</span> (comp.

For the specifically different manifestations, in which the manifold working of the One Spirit displayed itself, assumed indeed, in presence of such jealous seeking and striving, such an appearance to the eyes of the observer of this unseemly state of things, as though not one Spirit, but a <span class="ital">plurality of spirits</span>, differing in kind and importance, were the object of the rivalry. What were <span class="greekheb">διαιρέσεις χαρισμάτων</span>, and hence only different <span class="greekheb">φανερώσεις τοῦ πνευμάτος</span>, presented themselves, as matters stood at Corinth, to the eye and pen of the apostle as <span class="greekheb">διαιρέσεις πνευμάτων</span>. <span class="greekheb">Πνευμάτων</span>, therefore, is just as far from standing for <span class="greekheb">πνευματικῶν</span> (Beza, Piscator, Storr, Flatt, and others) as it is from denoting the glossolalia (Heydenreich, Billroth).[7] To suppose a <span class="ital">real plurality</span> of spirits, after the analogy of the persons possessed by a number of <span class="ital">evil</span> spirits (see Hilgenfeld, p. 52 f.), so that a number of <span class="ital">divine</span> spirits would be meant, is at variance with the N.

The edification of the church is in truth just the normative test for the appreciation and right pursuit of the charismata (vv. 3, 4, 17, 26; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-12.htm" title="For the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:">Ephesians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>).

The latter rendering, preferred by Cv[2064], Mr[2065], Al[2066], Hf[2067], Sm[2068], is truer to the order of the words, and reproduces the emphasis of <span class="greekheb">πρὸς τὴν οἰκοδομ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἐκκλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ζητεῖτε</span> has its object supplied before hand in the previous clause, and <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> (<span class="greekheb">περισσεύητε</span>) bears its ordinary sense as conj. of <span class="ital">purpose</span>. Spiritual powers are indeed <span class="ital">to be sought</span> (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>), provided that they be sought for the religious profiting of others, <span class="ital">with a view to abound in service</span> to the Church.
