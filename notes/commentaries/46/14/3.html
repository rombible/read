This drew attention, more than the plain interpretation of Scripture; it gratified pride more, but promoted the purposes of Christian charity less; it would not equally do good to the souls of men. What cannot be understood, never can edify. No advantage can be reaped from the most excellent discourses, if delivered in language such as the hearers cannot speak or understand. Every ability or possession is valuable in proportion to its usefulness. Even fervent, spiritual affection must be governed by the exercise of the understanding, else men will disgrace the truths they profess to promote.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But he that prophesieth - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>. He that speaks under the influence of inspiration in the common language of his hearers. This seems to be the difference between those who spoke in foreign languages and those who prophesied. Both were under the influence of the Holy Spirit; both might speak the same truths; both might occupy an equally important and necessary place in the church; but the language of the one was intelligible to the church, the other not; the one was designed to edify the church, the other to address those who spoke foreign tongues, or to give demonstration, by the power of speaking foreign languages, that the religion was from God.<p>Speaketh unto men - So as to be understood by those who were present.<p>To edification - See the note at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-8.htm">1 Corinthians 10:8</a>, note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-23.htm">1 Corinthians 10:23</a>.

He applies and enforces the practical duties of religion, and urges motives for a holy life.<p>And comfort - Encouragement. That is, he presents the promises and the "hopes" of the gospel; the various considerations adapted to administer comfort in the time of trial. The other might do this, but it would be in a foreign language, and would be useless to the church. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Preaches, prays, or sings, in a language understood by the common people: <p>speaketh unto men to edification; to the building of them up in Christ, and on their most holy faith, so that they grow up as an holy temple to the Lord: and exhortation; to the more vigorous exercise of grace, and the more cheerful and fervent discharge of duty: <p>and comfort; of distressed minds, either through the temptations of Satan, or divine desertions, or inward corruptions, or outward afflictions; for all which ends and purposes the Scriptures are written, and gifts are bestowed on men to explain them; and which ends are answered when God gives a blessing to the word; but can never be expected, if delivered in a language not understood. This bears hard upon the Papists performing any part of divine worship in a language unintelligible to the common people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But he that prophesieth speaketh unto men <i>to</i> <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span><p>(d) Which may further men in the study of godliness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm" title="But he that prophesies speaks to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.">1 Corinthians 14:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἰκοδομὴν</span>, <span class="ital">edification</span>) Two principal species are added to this genus; <span class="greekheb">παράκλησις</span>, <span class="ital">exhortation</span>, takes away sluggishness; <span class="greekheb">παραμυθία</span>, <span class="ital">consolation</span> takes away sadness.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - To <span class="cmt_word">edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</span> The "to" should be omitted.
