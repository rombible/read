The passage may run, either, as in the English, <span class= "ital">if any man does not know this, let</span> <span class= "ital">him not know it:</span> then the words would mean that a person who could not recognise such an evident and simple truth must be of a perverse mind—his opposition would give the Apostle no further concern. The other reading is, <span class= "ital">if any man knows not this, he is himself</span> <span class= "ital">not known:</span> this would signify that any man who knows not this truth is not known of God (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-2.htm" title="And if any man think that he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.">1Corinthians 8:2-3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1Corinthians 13:12</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:34-40 When the apostle exhorts Christian women to seek information on religious subjects from their husbands at home, it shows that believing families ought to assemble for promoting spiritual knowledge. The Spirit of Christ can never contradict itself; and if their revelations are against those of the apostle, they do not come from the same Spirit. The way to keep peace, truth, and order in the church, is to seek that which is good for it, to bear with that which is not hurtful to its welfare, and to keep up good behaviour, order, and decency.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if any be ignorant ... - If anyone affects to be ignorant of my authority, or whether I have a right to command.

I shall not take any further trouble to debate with him. I have stated my authority. I have delivered the commands of God. And now, if he disregards them, and still doubts whether all this is said by divine authority, let him abide the consequences of rejecting the law of God. I have given full proof of my divine commission. I have nothing more to say on that head. And now, if he chooses to remain in ignorance or incredulity, the fault is his own, and he must answer for it to God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>38. if any man be ignorant&#8212;wilfully; not wishing to recognize these ordinances and my apostolic authority in enjoining them.<p>let him be ignorant&#8212;I leave him to his ignorance: it will be at his own peril; I feel it a waste of words to speak anything further to convince him.

Of "these" words, as the Arabic version adds, and does not know and own them to be the commandments of Christ; though he may profess himself to be a prophet, or a spiritual man, he is a very ignorant one, and has not the Spirit of God he pretends to: and if he will not be convinced, but goes on to doubt, and call in question the truth of these things, and obstinately persist in his ignorance, <p>let him be ignorant: let him be treated and despised as an ignorant man; and let his ignorance be no hinderance to any in receiving these rules and directions as the commandments of Christ; for no regard is to be had, or pity shown, to a man of affected ignorance, and wilful obstinacy; such a man is not to be known and owned, but shunned and rejected. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{17}</span> But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</span><p>(17) The church ought not to care for those who are stubbornly ignorant, and will not abide to be taught, but to go forward nonetheless in those things which are right.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-38.htm" title="But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.">1 Corinthians 14:38</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀγνοεῖ</span>] namely, <span class="greekheb">ἃ γράφω ὑμῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1 Corinthians 14:37</a>.

This is an argument which would have weight with the Corinthians, who were very desirous of <span class="ital">knowledge</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγνοείτω</span>, <span class="ital">let him be ignorant</span>) which means, we cannot cast away all things for the sake of such a man; let him keep it to himself. Those, who are thus left to themselves, repent more readily, than if you were to teach them against their will.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Let him be ignorant.</span> The formula seems to fall under the idiom which refuses to say anything more about a subject ("If I perish, I perish;" "What I have written, I have written;" "He that is filthy, let him be filthy still," etc.). The readings vary considerably ("He is ignored;" "He has been ignored;" "He shall be ignored;" "Let him be ignored"). These other readings would be a statement of retribution in kind - of God "sprinkling penal blindnesses on forbidden lusts." But the reading of our translation is on the whole the best supported, and means that to invincible bigotry and ignorant obstinacy St. Paul will have no more to say (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-14.htm">Matthew 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-3.htm">1 Timothy 6:3-5</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/14.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Let him be ignorant (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;)<p>Let him remain ignorant.
