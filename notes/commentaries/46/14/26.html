He first gives directions regarding the tongues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-27.htm" title="If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret.">1Corinthians 14:27-28</a>), then regarding prophecy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-29.htm" title="Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.">1Corinthians 14:29-36</a>), and the concluding verses of this chapter contain a summing up and brief repetition of what has been already laid down. In this verse he introduces the practical application of the truths which he has been enforcing, by the question, “How is it, then?”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> what should follow from all these arguments?—and, instead of answering the question directly, he first recalls the existing state of confusion in their public assemblies, which had rendered necessary the teaching of the previous verses, and which is to be remedied by the practical instructions which now follow.<p><span class= "bld">When ye come together, every one of you hath . . .</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">when ye are assembling together each one of you hath a psalm, &c.</span> The uppermost thought in each mind as you are assembling for public worship is the individual gift which he possesses. One had the gift of pouring forth a psalm of praise; another could deliver a doctrinal discourse; another could speak to God in a tongue; another had some deep insight into the spiritual world; another could interpret the tongue. If these varied gifts were employed by each for his own gratification, or even for his own spiritual advancement, they would not be used worthy of the occasion. In public these gifts were to be exercised not by each one for himself, but for the building up of the whole Church.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-26.htm" title="How is it then, brothers? when you come together, every one of you has a psalm, has a doctrine, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation.

Dr. Macknight understands the passage in a somewhat different sense, paraphrasing it thus: <span class="ital">“What is to be done, </span>brethren, <span class="ital">When ye are assembled, one of you, </span>by inspiration, <span class="ital">hath a psalm; </span>another <span class="ital">hath a discourse; </span>another <span class="ital">hath </span>something made known to him in <span class="ital">a foreign language; </span>another, <span class="ital">a revelation </span>of some future event; another <span class="ital">hath an interpretation </span>of what was uttered in a foreign language. In such cases, <span class="ital">let all </span>these gifts <span class="ital">be exercised to edification.” </span>Grotius thinks the several clauses of this verse should be read interrogatively: <span class="ital">Hath each of you a psalm? hath he a discourse? </span>The inspired psalms of which the apostle speaks, were not metrical compositions, but compositions which were distinguished from prose by the sublimity of the sentiments, and the strength, beauty, and aptness of the expressions. Such was the inspired psalm which Mary, our Lord’s mother, uttered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-46.htm" title="And Mary said, My soul does magnify the Lord,">Luke 1:46</a>, and the inspired thanksgiving and prayer in which the disciples joined upon the deliverance of Peter and John from the council, recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/4-24.htm" title="And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said, Lord, you are God, which have made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:...">Acts 4:24-30</a>. The word <span class="greekheb">διδαχη</span>, rendered <span class="ital">doctrine </span>in our text, signifies not only the thing taught, but the discourse in which it is taught; and here, probably, a discourse for edification, exhortation, and consolation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:26-33 Religious exercises in public assemblies should have this view; Let all be done to edifying. As to the speaking in an unknown tongue, if another were present who could interpret, two miraculous gifts might be exercised at once, and thereby the church be edified, and the faith of the hearers confirmed at the same time. As to prophesying, two or three only should speak at one meeting, and this one after the other, not all at once. The man who is inspired by the Spirit of God will observe order and decency in delivering his revelations. God never teaches men to neglect their duties, or to act in any way unbecoming their age or station.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>How is it then, brethren? - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>. What is the fact? What actually occurs among you? Does that state of things exist which I have described? Is there that order in your public worship which is demanded and proper? It is implied in his asking this question that there might be some things among them which were improper, and which deserved reproof.<p>When ye come together - For worship.<p>Everyone of you ... - That is, all the things which are specified would be found among them. It is, evidently, not meant that all these things would be found in the same person, but would all exist at the same time; and thus confusion and disorder would be inevitable. Instead of waiting for an intimation from the presiding officer in the assembly, or speaking in succession and in order, each one probably regarded himself as under the influence of the Holy Spirit; as having an important message to communicate, or as being called on to celebrate the praises of God; and thus confusion and disorder would prevail. Many would be speaking at the same time, and a most unfavorable impression would be made on the minds of the strangers who should be present, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>. This implied reproof of the Corinthians is certainly a reproof of those public assemblies where many speak at the same time; or where a portion are engaged in praying, and others in exhortation. Nor can it be urged that in such cases those who engage in these exercises are under the influence of the Holy Spirit; for, however true that may be, yet it is no more true than it was in Corinth, and yet the apostle reproved the practice there. The Holy Spirit is the author of order, and not of confusion <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-33.htm">1 Corinthians 14:33</a>; and true religion prompts to peace and regularity, and not to discord and tumult.<p>Hath a psalm - Is disposed to sing; is inclined to praise; and, however irregular or improper, expresses his thanks in a public manner, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>.<p>Hath a doctrine - Has some religious truth on his mind which be deems it of special importance to inculcate, see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-6.htm">1 Corinthians 14:6</a>.<p>Hath a tongue - Has something made known to him in a foreign language, or has a power of speaking a foreign language, and exercises it, though it produces great confusion.<p>Hath a revelation - Some truth which has been particularly revealed to him; perhaps an explanation of some mystery (Doddridge); or a revelation ot some future event (Macknight); or a prophecy (Bloomfield); or a power of explaining some of the truths couched in the types and figures of the Old Testament. Grotius.<p>Hath an interpretation - An explanation of something that has been uttered by another in a foreign language; See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>.<p>Let all things ... - Let this be the great principle, to promote the edification of the church; See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>. If this rule were followed, it would prevent confusion and disorder. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>1Co 14:26-40. Rules for the Exercise of Gifts in the Congregation.<p>26. How is it then?&#8212;rather, "What then is the true rule to be observed as to the use of gifts?" Compare 1Co 14:15, where the same Greek occurs.<p>a psalm&#8212;extemporary, inspired by the Spirit, as that of Mary, Zechariah, Simeon, and Anna (Lu 1:46-55, 67-79; 2:34-38).<p>a doctrine&#8212;to impart and set forth to the congregation.<p>a tongue &#8230; a revelation&#8212;The oldest manuscripts transpose the order: "revelation &#8230; tongue"; "interpretation" properly following "tongue" (1Co 14:13).<p>Let all things be done unto edifying&#8212;The general rule under which this particular case fails; an answer to the question at the beginning of this verse. Each is bound to obey the ordinances of his church not adverse to Scripture. See Article XXXIV, Church of England Prayer Book.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By what followeth in the two next verses, one would think that some of them, in their church meetings, were so absurd, as, being endued with several gifts, they would be using them all together, one singing, another preaching, a third speaking with tongues, &c.; but this is so apparent a confusion, that one must be very uncharitable to this famous church, to presume that they should be so absurd. Others therefore rather think, that those endued with several gifts, of which he reckoneth five, (under which he comprehendeth all others), were every one contending for his course to exercise his gift; one, for spending the time in singing the psalm he had made; another, for spending the time in hearing his doctrinal discourse; a third, for the spending it in hearing him discourse in an unknown tongue; a fourth, for the spending it in hearing his revelation; a fifth, for the spending it in hearing his interpretation; or at least desiring the time might be protracted, until they had been all successively heard. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let all things be done unto edifying:</span> to prevent this and other disorders, the apostle giveth several rules. The first is: That all things should be so done, as might tend best to promote in men faith and holiness; that is and ought to be the main and chief end of those who any way minister in sacred things. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>How is it then, brethren?.... Or "what is it brethren?" The Arabic renders it, "what is the sense of my words?" The meaning of what he had said, the drift of his whole discourse; or rather the sense is, what is to be done in the case he was about to propose? <p>when ye come together; as a church into one place, to worship God; <p>everyone of you hath a psalm; not that everyone had this, or any other gift here mentioned, but that there were some among them that had one or other of these several gifts: some of them had a gift of composing and singing a psalm extempore; they delighted in psalmody, and were forward to promote it, and fond of spending the time wholly in it. <p>Hath a doctrine; others of them had a gift of deducing doctrines out of the word of God, which is profitable for that purpose, in an extraordinary manner, without study, and were capable of teaching them, and instructing men in them in a very edifying way: <p>hath a tongue others had the gift of speaking with divers tongues; or had knowledge and skill in the Hebrew tongue, could not only pray and sing in that language, and read the sacred text, but could deliver a sermon in it. <p>Hath a revelation; others had a peculiar insight into the types and figures of the Mosaic dispensation, a clear view of the prophetic writings, and a large discovery of the mysteries of the Gospel, by the Spirit, as a spirit of wisdom and revelation. <p>Hath an interpretation; others had a gift of interpreting languages, particularly the Hebrew language, when anything was delivered therein by another. Now the apostle answers to the question, what is to be done in such a case, where there is such a variety of gifts, and everyone is desirous of exercising his peculiar gift? <p>let all things be done to edifying; intimating, that each of these things might be done; every gift might be made use of: he that had a psalm might sing it; and he that had a doctrine might deliver it; he that had a tongue might speak with it; and he that had a revelation might declare it; and he that had an interpretation might make use of it; provided that care was taken that each was done in such a manner, as might be for the edifying of the church that was met together; otherwise, if it was only for ostentation sake to make a show of their gifts and talents, and to nourish their own pride and vanity, no good end would be answered; it had better be let alone: but if edification could be promoted, each gift might be employed; for which the apostle gives the following directions. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{12}</span> How is it then, brethren? when ye come together, every one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation.

Regulations to insure decency and order<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">26</span>. <span class="ital">hath a psalm</span>] The Apostle here reproves another fault. Not only are the Corinthians ambitious rather of the gifts which attract attention, than of those which do good to others, but in their exercise of those gifts they are utterly neglectful of Church order Each member of the teaching body (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-29.htm" title="Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles?">1 Corinthians 12:29</a> forbids us to include the whole Church) had his own special subject to bring before the Church; some hymn of praise, unpremeditated or otherwise, some point of Christian doctrine to enforce, some hidden mystery to reveal, some utterance in a foreign tongue, or some interpretation peculiar to himself of such utterance. This he desired to deliver just when the impulse seized him to do so, and all with a view of asserting himself, rather than of promoting the common welfare. The consequence was an amount of disorder which prevented the striking picture of the true effects of Christian prophecy in the last verse from being ever realized. For the various gifts mentioned in this verse see <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-2.htm" title="For he that speaks in an unknown tongue speaks not to men, but to God: for no man understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.">1 Corinthians 14:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-6.htm" title="Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?">1 Corinthians 14:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-13.htm" title="Why let him that speaks in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.">1 Corinthians 14:13</a></span>, and notes.

The word <span class="greekheb">ἔχει</span>, <span class="ital">has</span>, repeated, elegantly expresses the abundance of the gifts, which had been divided.—<span class="greekheb">ἀποκάλυψιν</span>, <span class="ital">revelation</span>) by which God communicates something to man; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-2.htm" title="And I went up by revelation, and communicated to them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to them which were of reputation, lest by any means I should run, or had run, in vain.">Galatians 2:2</a>, prophetical <span class="ital">revelation</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-30.htm" title="If any thing be revealed to another that sits by, let the first hold his peace.">1 Corinthians 14:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-29.htm" title="Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the other judge.">1 Corinthians 14:29</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἑρμηνείαν</span>, <span class="ital">interpretation</span>) by which one man may interpret an unknown <span class="ital">tongue</span> to another.—<span class="greekheb">οἰκοδομὴν</span>, <span class="ital">edification</span>) the best rule.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 26-33.</span> - <span class="accented">Rules to check disorderly self-assertion in Christian assemblies.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">How is it then?</span> The same phrase as in ver. 15. <span class="cmt_word">Every one of you hath a psalm,</span> etc. We see here a somewhat melancholy picture of the struggling self assertion of rival claimants to attention. <span class="cmt_word">A doctrine;</span> rather, <span class="accented">a teaching</span>, The glossolaly had probably been promoted by Syrian enthusiasts, perhaps of the Petrine party; the egotism of oratory and itch of teaching now described (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm">James 3:1</a>) may have been developed in the Apollonian party. <span class="cmt_word">Unto edifying.</span> The object is moral improvement, not idle self display, not the ostentation of individual gifts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-7.htm">1 Corinthians 12:7, 8, 10</a>). To this he recurs again and again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-9.htm">1 Corinthians 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3, 5, 12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-1.htm">2 Corinthians 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/10-8.htm">2 Corinthians 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-19.htm">2 Corinthians 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-10.htm">2 Corinthians 13:10</a>; and the verb frequently). The substantive, as used by St. Paul, only occurs again in Romans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-19.htm">Romans 14:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-2.htm">Romans 15:2</a>), and in Ephesians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm">Ephesians 2:21</a>, etc.). </body></html>
