A man praying in a tongue needed the gift of interpretation. The emotions of his spirit, kindled by the Spirit of God, found utterance in a “tongue,” the gift of the Spirit of God; but his intellectual faculty grasped no definite idea, and could not, therefore, formulate it into human language; therefore the prayer which is offered merely in a tongue, from the spirit and not from the understanding, is useless as regards others. The Apostle is here speaking of public worship (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-16.htm" title="Else when you shall bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupies the room of the unlearned say Amen at your giving of thanks, seeing he understands not what you say?">1Corinthians 14:16</a>), and not of private devotion; and the word “fruitless” implies the result, or rather the absence of result, as regards others.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:6-14 Even an apostle could not edify, unless he spoke so as to be understood by his hearers. To speak words that have no meaning to those who hear them, is but speaking into the air. That cannot answer the end of speaking, which has no meaning; in this case, speaker and hearers are barbarians to each other. All religious services should be so performed in Christian assemblies, that all may join in, and profit by them. Language plain and easy to be understood, is the most proper for public worship, and other religious exercises. Every true follower of Christ will rather desire to do good to others, than to get a name for learning or fine speaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if I pray ... - The reference to prayer here, and to singing in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>, is designed to illustrate the propriety of the general sentiment which he is defending, that public worship should be conducted in a language that would be intelligible to the people. However well meant it might be, or however the "heart" might be engaged in it, yet unless it was intelligible, and the understanding could join in it, it would be vain and profitless.<p>My spirit prayeth - The word spirit here (&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  pneuma) has been variously understood. Some have understood it of the Holy Spirit - the Spirit by which Paul says he was actuated. Others of the "spiritual gift," or that spiritual influence by which he was endowed. Others of the mind itself. But it is probable that the word "spirit" refers to the "will;" or to the mind, as the seat of the affections and emotions; that is, to the heart, desires, or intentions. The word "spirit" is often used in the Scriptures as the seat of the affections, and emotions, and passions of various kinds; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>, "Blessed are the poor in spirit;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-21.htm">Luke 10:21</a>, "Jesus rejoiced in spirit." So it is the seat of ardor or fervor <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>; of grief or indignation; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-12.htm">Mark 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-33.htm">John 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-21.htm">John 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-16.htm">Acts 17:16</a>. It refers also to feelings, disposition, or temper of mind, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-55.htm">Luke 9:55</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-15.htm">Romans 8:15</a>. Here it refers, it seems to me. to the heart, the will, the disposition, the feelings, as contradistinguished from the understanding; and the sense is, "My feelings find utterance in prayer; my heart is engaged in devotion; my prayer will be acceptable to God, who looks upon the feelings of the heart, and I may have true enjoyment; but my understanding will be unfruitful, that is, will not profit others. What I say will not he understood by them; and of course, however much benefit I might derive from my devotions, yet they would be useless to others."<p>But my understanding - (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;  ho de nous mou).

On the distinction of soul or mind and spirit, see Eph 4:23; Heb 4:12.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> From this and the former verse, the papists would justify the lawfulness of their Latin service, which none or few of the common people understand; and they seem to have a little advantage from the opinion of some of the ancients: That some of those who spake with tongues, did not themselves understand what they uttered, but the Spirit of God only made use of their tongues as machines. But these are apprehensions much beneath the Spirit of light and truth, that it should make use of the tongue of a man for an end neither profitable to the man himself, nor others.
