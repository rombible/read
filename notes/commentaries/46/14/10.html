In process of time, however, the Romans, having subdued the Greeks, delivered themselves by force of arms from that opprobrious appellation, and joined the Greeks in calling all barbarians who did not speak either the Greek or the Latin language. Afterward, the word <span class="ital">barbarian </span>signified any one who spake a language which another did not understand. Thus the Scythian philosopher, Anacharsis, said, that among the Athenians, the Scythians were <span class="ital">barbarians; </span>and among the Scythians, the Athenians were <span class="ital">barbarians. </span>This is the sense of the word <span class="ital">barbarian </span>in this passage.” <span class="ital">Even so, </span>&c. —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Wherefore ye also, that ye may not be barbarians to each other; <span class="ital">forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts </span>— And are ready to vie with each other in the exercise of them, seek that ye may excel to <span class="ital">the edifying of the church </span>— And not merely for your own honour.

To speak words that have no meaning to those who hear them, is but speaking into the air. That cannot answer the end of speaking, which has no meaning; in this case, speaker and hearers are barbarians to each other. All religious services should be so performed in Christian assemblies, that all may join in, and profit by them. Language plain and easy to be understood, is the most proper for public worship, and other religious exercises. Every true follower of Christ will rather desire to do good to others, than to get a name for learning or fine speaking.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There are it may be ... - There has been considerable variety in the interpertation of this expression. Rosenmuller renders it, "for the sake of example." Grotius supposes that Paul meant to indicate that there were, perhaps, or might be, as many languages as the Jews supposed, to wit, seventy. Beza and others suppose it means, that there may he as many languages as there are nations of people. Bloomfield renders it, "Let there he as many kinds of languages as you choose." Macknight, "There are, no doubt, as many kinds of languages in the world as ye speak." Robinson (Lexicon) renders it, "If so happen, it may be; perchance, perhaps;" and says the phrase is equivalent to "for example," The sense is, "There are perhaps, or for example, very many kinds of voices in the world; and all are significant. None are used by those who speak them without meaning; none speak them without designing to convey some intelligible idea to their hearers." The "argument" is, that as "all" the languages that are in the world, however numerous they are, are for "utility," and as none are used for the sake of mere display, so it should be with those who had the power of speaking them in the Christian church. They should speak them only when and where they would be understood.<p>Voices - Languages. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. it may be&#8212;that is, perhaps, speaking by conjecture.

So in all the passages in Wetstein, Loesner, p. 293; Viger. ed. Herm. p. 301, which are usually adduced in support of what is assumed (by Rückert also) to be the meaning here: <span class="ital">for example</span>. The phrase has never this meaning, and merely its approximate sense can be so expressed,[4] and that always but very unexactly, in several passages (such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-37.htm" title="And that which you sow, you sow not that body that shall be, but bore grain, it may chance of wheat, or of some other grain:">1 Corinthians 15:37</a>; Lucian, <span class="ital">Amor.</span> 27). And in the present case this sense does not suit at all, partly because it would be very strange if Paul, after having already adduced flutes, citherns, and trumpets as examples, should now for the first time come out with a “<span class="ital">for example</span>,” partly and chiefly because <span class="greekheb">εἰ τύχοι</span> is a defining addition, not to the thing itself (<span class="greekheb">γένη φωνῶν</span>), but to its quantity (to <span class="greekheb">τοσαῦτα</span>).
