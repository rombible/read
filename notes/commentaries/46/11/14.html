Probably the former is the true meaning of the passage which refers to the fact that the heathen who had no direct revelation did (by regarding long hair as a woman’s glory) “by nature” the things contained in the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-14.htm" title="If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.">Romans 11:14</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-16 Here begin particulars respecting the public assemblies, ch. 1Co 14. In the abundance of spiritual gifts bestowed on the Corinthians, some abuses had crept in; but as Christ did the will, and sought the honour of God, so the Christian should avow his subjection to Christ, doing his will and seeking his glory. We should, even in our dress and habit, avoid every thing that may dishonour Christ. The woman was made subject to man, because made for his help and comfort. And she should do nothing, in Christian assemblies, which looked like a claim of being equal. She ought to have power, that is, a veil, on her head, because of the angels. Their presence should keep Christians from all that is wrong while in the worship of God. Nevertheless, the man and the woman were made for one another. They were to be mutual comforts and blessings, not one a slave, and the other a tyrant. God has so settled matters, both in the kingdom of providence and that of grace, that the authority and subjection of each party should be for mutual help and benefit. It was the common usage of the churches, for women to appear in public assemblies, and join in public worship, veiled; and it was right that they should do so. The Christian religion sanctions national customs wherever these are not against the great principles of truth and holiness; affected singularities receive no countenance from any thing in the Bible.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Doth not even nature itself - The word nature (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  phusis) denotes evidently that sense of propriety which all men have, and which is expressed in any prevailing or universal custom. That which is universal we say is according to nature. It is such as is demanded by the natural sense of fitness among people. Thus, we may say that nature demands that the sexes should wear different kinds of dress; that nature demands that the female should be modest and retiring; that nature demands that the toils of the chase, of the field, of war - the duties of office, of government and of professional life, should be discharged by people. Such are in general the customs the world over; and if any reason is asked for numerous habits that exist in society, no better answer can be given than that nature, as arranged by God, has demanded it. The word in this place, therefore, does not mean the constitution of the sexes, as Locke, Whitby, and Pierce maintain; nor reason and experience, as Macknight supposes; nor simple use and custom, as Grotius, Rosenmuller, and most recent expositors suppose; but it refers to a deep internal sense of what is proper and right; a sense which is expressed extensively in all nations. showing what that sense is.<p>No reason can be given, in the nature of things, why the woman should wear long hair and the man not; but the custom prevails extensively everywhere, and nature, in all nations, has prompted to the same course. "Use is second nature;" but the usage in this case is not arbitrary, but is founded in an anterior universal sense of what is proper and right. A few, and only a few, have regarded it as comely for a man to wear his hair long. Aristotle tells us, indeed (Rhet. 1: - see Rosenmuller), that among the Lacedemonians, freemen wore their hair long. In the time of Homer, also, the Greeks were called by him &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x391;&#787;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  kare&#772;komoo&#772;ntes Achaioi, long-haired Greeks; and some of the Asiatic nations adopted the same custom. But the general habit among people has been different. Among the Hebrews, it was regarded as disgraceful to a man to wear his hair long, except he had a vow as a Nazarite, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-1.htm">Numbers 6:1-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm">Judges 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-17.htm">Judges 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>. Occasionally, for affectation or singularity, the hair was suffered to grow, as was the case with Absalom <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm">2 Samuel 14:26</a>; but the traditional law of the Jews on the subject was strict. The same rule existed among the Greeks; and it was regarded as disgraceful to wear long hair in the time of Aelian; Hist. lib. 9:c. 14. Eustath. on Hom. 2:v.<p>It is a shame unto him? - It is improper and disgraceful. It is doing that which almost universal custom has said appropriately belongs to the female sex. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. The fact that nature has provided woman, and not man, with long hair, proves that man was designed to be uncovered, and woman covered. The Nazarite, however, wore long hair lawfully, as being part of a vow sanctioned by God (Nu 6:5). Compare as to Absalom, 2Sa 14:26, and Ac 18:18.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He tells them, that they could not judge this as a thing comely, for nature itself taught them, that it is a shame for a man to wear long hair. By <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">nature</span> here some understand the law of nature, according to which it would have an intrinsic evil in it, which it is plain it hath not; for then neither must the Nazarites have used it, (as they did), neither would it be lawful for the sake of men’s health or life. Others understand by <span class="bld">nature</span> the law of nations; but neither is this true, for in many nations men wear hair at the utmost length. Others understand common sense, or the light and judgment of that natural reason which since the fall is left in man; but this must be the same in all men, and we know that all men do not judge this shameful. Others therefore by <span class="bld">nature</span> here understand a common custom, which (as they say) maketh as it were a second nature; so the term is taken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-24.htm" title="For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive tree?">Romans 11:24</a></span>: but it cannot so signify here; for there neither is, nor ever was, such a universal custom in any place, that none in it wore long hair. Others by <span class="bld">nature</span> here understand natural inclination; but neither can this be the sense, for there is in some men, as well as in women, a natural propension and inclination to wear their hair at excessive lengths. Others here by <span class="bld">nature</span> understand the difference of the sex, as they take this word to be used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-26.htm" title="For this cause God gave them up to vile affections: for even their women did change the natural use into that which is against nature:">Romans 1:26</a></span>; the distinction of the sexes teacheth us this: and this seemath to be the most probable sense of this text. The apostle arguing, that as the male and female sex are artificially distinguished by garments, and it was the will of God they should be so, so they should also be distinguished by the wearing of their hair; and it was no less shame for a man to wear his hair like a woman, than to wear garments like a woman. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Doth not even nature itself teach you,.... By nature is either meant, the law and light of nature, reason in man, common sense, or rather custom, which is second nature; and which, in this case, must be restrained to the Greeks and Jews; for though among the Grecians the men cut their hair, and did not suffer it to grow long, as also did the Jews, yet there were many nations (k) who did not, even at that time, observe such a rule or custom; but as the Jews and Greeks were the persons chiefly, if not solely, known to the Corinthians, the apostle signifies, that the usages of these people might direct and inform them in this matter: <p>that if a man have long hair it is a shame unto him; he looks unmanly and womanish, and exposes himself to ridicule and contempt. <p>(k) Alex. ab.

(Yes), for if a man have long hair, etc.” The common rendering is preferable; the teaching of nature is expressed in a double sentence, which gathers the <span class="ital">consensus gentium</span> on the subject: “that in a man’s case, if he wear long hair (<span class="ital">vir quidem si comam nutriat</span>, Vg[1657]), it is a dishonour to him; but in a woman’s, if she wear long hair, it is a glory to her”. <span class="greekheb">ἀνήρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">γυνὴ</span> stand in conspicuous antithesis preceding the conj.: what is discreditable in the one is delightful in the other. Homer’s warriors, it is true, wore long hair (<span class="greekheb">καρηκομοῶντες Ἀχαιοί</span>), a fashion retained at Sparta; but the Athenian youth cropped his head at 18, and it was a mark of foppery or effeminacy (a legal <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμία</span>), except for the aristocratic Knights, to let the hair afterwards grow long. This feeling prevailed in ancient as it does in modern manners (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the case of Absalom). In the rule of the Nazirites natural instinct was set aside by an exceptional religious vocation. The woman’s <span class="greekheb">κόμη</span> is not merely no <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμία</span>, but a positive <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>; herself the <span class="greekheb">δόξα ἀνδρός</span>, her beauty has in this its crown and ensign. And this “glory” is grounded upon her humility: “because her hair <span class="ital">to serve as a hood</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ περιβολαίου</span>) has been given her”—not as a substitute for head-dress (this would be to stultify Paul’s contention), but <span class="ital">in the nature of</span> a covering, thus <span class="ital">to match</span> the veil (<span class="ital">en guise de voile</span>, Gd[1658]); <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">χάριν ἀντὶ χάριτος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-16.htm" title="And of his fullness have all we received, and grace for grace.">John 1:16</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ κασιγνήτου ξεῖνος</span> … <span class="greekheb">τέτευκται</span>, <span class="ital">Odyss</span>. viii., 456. <span class="greekheb">δέδοται</span> (pf. pass[1659]) connotes a <span class="ital">permanent</span> boon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, we do you to wit of the grace of God bestowed on the churches of Macedonia;">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not.">1 John 3:1</a>, etc.). <span class="greekheb">περιβόλαιον</span> (from <span class="greekheb">περιβάλλω</span>), a <span class="ital">wrapper, mantle</span>, is here exceptionally used of head-gear.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1654] C.

St Paul is speaking of the natural sense of what is fitting in those whom he addressed. In early times the Greeks and the Romans wore long hair, and the Gauls and Germans did so in St Paul’s own time. So Homer continually speaks of the “long-haired Greeks.” St Chrysostom remarks that those who addicted themselves to philosophy in his day wore their hair long. But this was mere affectation. Cf. Horace, <span class="ital">De Arte Poetica</span>, 297,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Bona pars non ungues ponere curat,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Non barbam, secreta petit loca, balnea vitat.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the general verdict of society has been that appealed to by the Apostle. “This instinctive consciousness of propriety on this point had been established by custom, and had become <span class="greekheb">φύσις</span> (nature).”—Meyer.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/11.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1 Corinthians 11:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐδε αὐτὴ</span>) does <span class="ital">not even</span> nature <span class="ital">itself</span>, from which all learn very easily.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ φύσις</span>, <span class="ital">nature</span>) and its light concerning what is becoming.—<span class="greekheb">ἐὰν κομᾷ</span>) <span class="ital">if</span> he <span class="ital">has</span> long <span class="ital">hair</span>, like a <span class="ital">covering;</span> for he is not commanded to be altogether shorn.—<span class="greekheb">ἀτιμία</span>, <span class="ital">disgrace</span>) viz., if he do that without any reason; for sometimes even hair becomes men.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm" title="All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor come on his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which he separates himself to the LORD, he shall be holy, and shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.">Numbers 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-26.htm" title="And when he polled his head, (for it was at every year's end that he polled it: because the hair was heavy on him, therefore he polled it:) he weighed the hair of his head at two hundred shekels after the king's weight.">2 Samuel 14:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-18.htm" title="And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brothers, and sailed there into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.">Acts 18:18</a>.
