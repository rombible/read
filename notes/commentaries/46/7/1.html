Further, as no person in early life can foresee what his future state of mind will be, or what temptations he may meet with, he cannot certainly know whether it will be in his power to live chastely unmarried. Wherefore, as that is the only case in which the apostle allows persons to live unmarried, vows of celibacy and virginity, taken in early life, must in both sexes be sinful.” — Macknight.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single.

The first, it seems, was in regard to the propriety of marriage; that is, whether it was lawful and expedient.<p>It is good - It is well. It is fit, convenient, or, it is suited to the present circumstances, or, the thing itself is well and expedient in certain circumstances. The apostle did not mean that marriage was unlawful, for he says <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-4.htm">Hebrews 13:4</a> that "marriage is honorable in all." But he here admits, with one of the parties in Corinth, that it was well, and proper in some circumstances, not to enter into the marriage relation; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7-8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-28.htm">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-31.htm">1 Corinthians 7:31-32</a>.<p>Not to touch a woman - Not to be connected with her by marriage.

Heb 13:4, in opposition to ascetic and Romish notions of superior sanctity in celibacy, declares, "Marriage is HONORABLE IN ALL." Another reason why in some cases celibacy may be a matter of Christian expediency is stated in 1Co 7:34, 35, "that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction."

Though the false apostles had greatly influenced the members of this church, yet there were many among them that had a very great respect for the apostle, and kept up a correspondence with him, though at a distance from him, by writing; in which way they informed him of their doubts and difficulties, that arose in their minds about certain things, and desired his judgment in them, to which they paid a very great deference. The things they wrote to him about, here referred to, may be collected from the contents of this chapter, and some others following; as whether a Christian man ought not to abstain from the use of women; whether a believer ought to live with an unbelieving yoke fellow; whether such as had been circumcised should not make use of some methods to draw on the foreskin of their flesh; whether apprentices, who were called by the grace of God, ought to serve out their time with their masters; and concerning celibacy or virginity, the eating of things offered to idols, and the maintenance of ministers: and he begins with the first; to which he answers, <p>it is good for a man not to touch a woman; which is to be understood, not of merely touching a woman, which can neither be criminal, nor in all cases inexpedient, or be attended with any ill, or dangerous consequences; nor of the matrimonial contract, which is lawful and honourable; but of the act of carnal copulation with a woman: in this sense the Jews use the phrase, <p>"there are three (they say (r)) that fled from transgression, and the blessed God joined his name with them; and they are these, Joseph, and Joel, and Phalti. Joseph, as appears from what is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/81-5.htm">Psalm 81:5</a> "a testimony in Joseph is his name"; what is the meaning of the phrase "in Joseph?" this testifies concerning him,    , "that he did not touch Potiphar's wife" (i.e. he did not lie with her); Jael, as is clear from what is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-18.htm">Judges 4:18</a> "and Jael went forth to meet Sisera, and she covered him with a mantle"; what is the meaning of the phrase,  (which is rendered, "with a mantle";) our Rabbins here (in Babylon) say with a linen cloth; but our Rabbins there (in the land of Israel) say with bed clothes; says Resh Lekish, if we run over the whole Scripture, we shall not find any household goods so called; wherefore what is it? it is all one as , "my name is thus": and the meaning is, my name witnesses concerning her,    , "that that wicked one (Sisera) did not touch her" (s); (i.e. had not carnal knowledge of her;) Phalti, as is evident from hence, one Scripture says, "and Saul gave Michal his daughter to Phalti", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a> and another Scripture says Phaltiel; sometimes he is called Phalti, and sometimes he is called Phaltiel; who takes Phalti? and who gives Phaltiel? but I testify concerning him;   , "that he did not touch David's wife"; (i.e. did not lie with her;)'' <p>see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-6.htm">Genesis 20:6</a>. And in this sense also is the word "touch" used, both by Greek and Latin authors. The apostle's meaning is not that it is unlawful to marry, or that it is sinful to lie with a woman in lawful wedlock; but that it is much better, and more expedient on several accounts, to abstain from the use of women, when persons have the gift of continency. <p>(r) Vajikra Rabba, sect. 23. fol. 164. 4. &amp; 165. 1.

In particular, there must have been at Corinth opponents of marriage. This is wrongly denied by Baur, who imagines merely an attempt made among the Corinthians to defend fornication from the analogy of marriage; of which there is not a trace in the apostle’s words. Whether, now, the doubts in question, more especially as to the lawfulness of marriage,[1050] were mixed up with the <span class="ital">subsistence of the parties</span> at Corinth, it is impossible to make out with any certainty, although in itself it seems likely that a matter of opinion so important practically would be turned, with other points, to account in the interest of party. Grotius holds that those who raised such points of debate were “<span class="ital">sub Christianorum nomine philosophi verius quam Christiani</span>.” But such of the Greek philosophers as advocated views adverse to marriage did so upon the ground of the <span class="ital">cares</span> and <span class="ital">dangers</span> connected with marriage (see Grotius <span class="ital">in loc</span>[1051]), not from any doubt regarding its <span class="ital">morality</span>, as, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-28.htm" title="But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-36.htm" title="But if any man think that he behaves himself uncomely toward his virgin, if she pass the flower of her age, and need so require, let him do what he will, he sins not: let them marry.">1 Corinthians 7:36</a>, must have been the case among the Corinthians. Further, it is certain that the adversaries of marriage could <span class="ital">not</span> be of the <span class="ital">Petrine party</span>; for Peter himself was married (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-14.htm" title="And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's mother laid, and sick of a fever.">Matthew 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>), and the Judaizing tendency, which cannot be proved to have had an Essene-Ebionitic character in Corinth (Schwegler, I. p. 163 f.[1052]), could be nothing else but favourable to marriage (see Lightfoot, <span class="ital">Horae</span>, p. 189). Olshausen (comp also Jaeger, Kniewel, Goldhorn, Ewald) decides for the <span class="ital">Christ-party</span>, in whose idealistic tendency he considers there were contained the germs both of moral indifference and of false asceticism. But this party’s idealism in general is a pure hypothesis, which is as little established by proof as their <span class="ital">Essenism</span> in particular, to which Ewald traces back the rejection of marriage among the Corinthians.[1054] In the last place, that it was the <span class="ital">followers of Paul</span> (Storr, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Pott, Neander, Räbiger, Osiander, Maier; Rückert refuses to give a decision), who—in opposition, perhaps, to the Petrine party, and appealing to the celibacy of Paul himself, he never having been married (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>)—overvalued celibacy, and pronounced marriage to stand lower in point of morality and holiness, is the most likely view, for this reason, that the apostle’s sentiments upon this point were in themselves, as we see from the chapter before us, quite of a kind to be readily misunderstood or misinterpreted by many of his disciples—more especially in partisan interests—as being unfavourable to marriage.[1055] It merely required that men should overlook or wish to overlook the <span class="ital">conditional</span> character of the advantages which he ascribes to single life. The opponents of marriage referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a> were of a totally different class. Those with whom we are now concerned did not forbid marriage and so endanger Christian liberty (otherwise Paul would have written regarding them in quite another tone), but simply undervalued it, placing it morally <span class="ital">below</span> celibacy, and advising against it, hence, too, as respects married persons, favouring a cessation from matrimonial intercourse and even divorce (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-3.htm" title="Let the husband render to the wife due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.">1 Corinthians 7:3</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1 Corinthians 7:10</a> ff.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ</span>] With respect to what you have written to me (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΡῚ</span></span> <span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span></span></span>[1056], absolute, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-1.htm" title="Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do you.">1 Corinthians 16:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-12.htm" title="As touching our brother Apollos, I greatly desired him to come to you with the brothers: but his will was not at all to come at this time; but he will come when he shall have convenient time.">1 Corinthians 16:12</a>; Bernhardy, p. 261; Bremi, <span class="ital">a</span>[1057]<span class="ital"> Demosth.

That, in a general theoretical point of view, is the prevailing axiom, which I hereby enunciate as my decision; but in a practical point of view, seeing that few have the gift of continence, the precept must come in: because of fornication, etc., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>. In Paul’s eyes, therefore, the <span class="greekheb">γυναικὸς μὴ ἅπτεσθαι</span> is, indeed, something morally salutary in and by itself; but this affirmation, made from a general point of view, finds its necessary limitation and restriction in the actual facts of the case, so that just according to circumstances marriage may be equally a duty. Hence the <span class="greekheb">καλὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>[1060] is not appropriate for the defence of celibacy in general (“si <span class="ital">bonum</span> est mulierem non tangere, <span class="ital">malum</span> ergo est tangere,” Jerome, <span class="ital">a</span>[1061]<span class="ital"> Jovin.</span> i. 4, and see especially Cornelius a Lapide <span class="ital">in loc</span>[1062]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἍΠΤΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, like <span class="ital">tangere</span> in the sense of <span class="ital">sexual intercourse</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-16.htm" title="And to Sarah he said, Behold, I have given your brother a thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to you a covering of the eyes, to all that are with you, and with all other: thus she was reproved.">Genesis 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-11.htm" title="And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son.">Genesis 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-29.htm" title="So he that goes in to his neighbor's wife; whoever touches her shall not be innocent.">Proverbs 6:29</a>). See Wetstein and Kypke, II. p. 204 f. Marriage is the particular case coming under this general <span class="greekheb">γυναικὸς ἅπτεσθαι</span>, to be treated of in detail hereafter. Rückert, failing to recognise this progress in the apostle’s argument (so, too, Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit.</span> 1839, p. 444), holds that the reference is to sexual intercourse in <span class="ital">marriages already formed</span> (and that nothing is said of <span class="ital">entering into</span> matrimonial connections). Did Paul, as Kling supposes, here give it as his opinion that “<span class="ital">a chaste life, as of brother and sister</span>, was more consonant, on the part of married persons, with delicacy of moral feeling” (<span class="greekheb">καλόν</span>); this would be a sentimental <span class="ital">error</span>, which ought not to be attributed to him, whether considered in itself, or in view of his high appreciation of marriage as a union of the sexes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-28.htm" title="So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.

But had that been the case, we should surely have found some traces of it in Paul’s way of discussing the question, whereas, on the contrary, the reference which he deems it due to make is rather to <span class="ital">his own example</span> (ver. 7). Looking at the matter as a whole, it is <span class="ital">prima facie</span> improbable that any one should have adduced the unwedded life of Christ as an argument against marriage—in the first place, because He, as the incarnate Son of God, held too lofty a place in the believing consciousness to present a standard for such earthly relationships; and secondly, because He Himself in His teaching had so strongly upheld the sanctity of marriage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1055] Just as they were often misinterpreted, as is well known, in after times in the interests of the celibate system, of nunneries and monasteries.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1056] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1057] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1058] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1059] That we have in <span class="greekheb">καλὸν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. a moral axiom, a statement of what is <span class="ital">ethically</span> salutary, not a mere utilitarian principle of practical prudence, is clear, especially from the comparison in the last clause of ver. 9, and from vv. 32–34, where the ethical benefit of it is explained.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1060] .<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ λοιπά</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1061] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1062] <span class="ital">n loc.</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1064] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman....">1 Corinthians 7:1-9</a>. § 20. MARRIAGE OR CELIBACY? At this point the Ap. takes up the questions addressed to him by the Cor[993] Church (see <span class="ital">Introd</span>., chap. 2). In replying to Paul’s previous letter, they had asked for clearer instructions to regulate their intercourse with men living in heathen sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="Defraud you not one the other, except it be with consent for a time, that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency.">1 Corinthians 7:5</a>); this request led up to the inquiries respecting the desirability of <span class="ital">marriage</span>, respecting the duties of married Christians, and the lawfulness of divorce for a Christian married to a heathen, with which ch. 7 is occupied. The headings of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>, chh. 8, 11, 16, indicate various matters on which the Cor[994] had consulted their Ap. The local impress and temporary aim of the directions here given on the subject of marriage must be borne in mind; otherwise Paul’s treatment will appear to be narrow and unsympathetic, and out of keeping with the exalted sense of its spiritual import disclosed in Ephesians 5. Indeed, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God....">1 Corinthians 11:3-15</a> of this Ep. show that P. had larger conception on the relations of man and woman than are here unfolded. The obscurity of expression attaching to several passages betrays the writer’s embarrassment; this was due partly to the low moral sensibility of the Cor[995], and partly to the uncertain continuance of the existing order of life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be....">1 Corinthians 7:26-31</a>), which weighed with the Ap. at the time of writing and led him to discourage the formation of domestic ties. In later Epistles, when the present economy had opened out into a larger perspective, the ethics of marriage and the Christian household are worthily developed (see Col. and Eph.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[993] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[994] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[995] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman....">1 Corinthians 7:1-9</a>. Advice concerning Marriage and Celibacy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote unto me</span>] The newly converted Corinthians had evidently found themselves in a difficulty concerning marriage. The Jews in general, whatever ascetics like the Essenes and Therapeutæ among them may have done, set a high value upon it; while the best of the heathen philosophers were inclined to depreciate it, and certain sayings of our Lord (see St <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-5.htm" title="And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall join to his wife: and they two shall be one flesh?...">Matthew 19:5-12</a>) seemed to support their view. The Corinthians had evidently written to consult St Paul on the point. The Apostle’s advice may be thus summarized: that though the unmarried were, from their freedom from all entangling ties, most at liberty to serve God in any way that He might put before them, and though in the present season of temptation and persecution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-28.htm" title="But and if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned. Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.">1 Corinthians 7:28</a>) the unmarried would be spared much trial and anguish which would fall heavily upon married persons, yet that it was the duty of those who, in an unmarried state, were in danger of offending against that solemn law of Christian purity which he had just laid down, to “marry, and so keep themselves undefiled members of Christ’s Body.” The growth in these luxurious days of habits at variance with the simple and unostentatious life of the true Christian, places great difficulties in the way of those who would follow St Paul’s advice, and is, therefore, the cause of an amount of immorality and misery which it were better to prevent than to be compelled to cure.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ δὲ ὧν ἐγράψατε</span>, <span class="ital">Now concerning the things whereof ye wrote</span>) He sets before us his subject at the first with elegance, rather generally than particularly. The apostles in their epistles often treat of marriage; the apostle Paul alone, once and not of his own accord, but when he was asked, advises celibacy, and that too very gently. [<span class="ital">So far is this from being a subject, which ought to be obtruded upon mankind by human precepts</span>.—V.g.]—<span class="greekheb">καλὸν</span>, <span class="ital">good</span>) This agrees with the feeling, which pervades the preceding chapter.

It is <span class="cmt_word">good for a man not to touch a woman.</span> The word used is not <span class="accented">agathon</span>, good, but <span class="accented">kalon</span>, fair; "an excellent thing." In ver. 26 he limits the word by the clause, "good <span class="accented">for the present necessity."</span> There is no limitation here, and it is probable that St. Paul is quoting the actual words of the letter which he had received from Corinth. There had sprung up among them some antinomians, who, perhaps by perverting his own teaching or that of Apollos, had made liberty a cloak of lasciviousness. In indignant reaction against such laxity, others, perhaps, with Essene proclivities, had been led to disparage matrimony as involving an inevitable stain. Gnosticism, and the spirit which led to it, oscillated between the two extremes of asceticism and uncleanness. Both extremes were grounded on the assertion that matter is inherently evil. Ascetic Gnostics, therefore, strove to destroy by severity every carnal impulse; antinomian Gnostics argued that the life of the spirit was so utterly independent of the flesh that what the flesh did was of no consequence. We find the <span class="accented">germs</span> of Gnostic heresy long before the name appeared. Theoretically, St. Paul inclines to the ascetic view, not in the abstract, but in view of the near advent of Christ, and of the cares, distractions, and even trials which marriage involved in days of struggle and persecution. Yet his wisdom is shown in the cautious moderation with which he expresses himself. The tone of the letter written by Gregory the Great to Augustine with reference to similar inquiries about Saxon converts is very different. The example of St. Paul should have shown the mediaeval moralists and even the later Fathers how wrong it is "to give themselves airs of certainty on points where certainty is not to be had." <span class="accented">Not to touch a woman.</span> St. Paul means generally "not to marry" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-4.htm">Genesis 20:4</a> [LXX.]). Celibacy under the then existing conditions of the Christian world is, he admits, in itself an honourable and morally salutary thing, though, for the majority, marriage may be a positive duty. He is not dreaming of the <span class="accented">nominal</span> marriages of mediaeval ascetics, for he assumes and directs that all who marry should live in conjugal union. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_corinthians/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>It is good (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-11.htm">John 10:11</a>.
