It is the duty of every Christian to be content with his lot, and to conduct himself in his rank and place as becomes a Christian. Our comfort and happiness depend on what we are to Christ, not what we are in the world. No man should think to make his faith or religion, an argument to break through any natural or civil obligations. He should quietly and contentedly abide in the condition in which he is placed by Divine Providence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye are bought with a price - Though you are slaves to people, yet you have been purchased for God by the blood of His Son; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>. You are, therefore, in his sight of inestimable worth, and are bound to be His.<p>Be not ye the servants of men - That is, "Do not regard yourselves as the slaves of men. Even in your humble relation of life, even as servants under the laws of the land, regard yourselves as the servants of God, as obeying and serving him "even in this relation," since all those who are bought with a price - all Christians, whether bond or free - are in fact the servant (slaves, &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;  douloi) of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-22.htm">1 Corinthians 7:22</a>. in this relation, therefore, esteem yourselves as the servants of God, as bound by his laws, as subject to him, and as really serving him, while you yield all proper obedience to your master." Rosenmuller, Grotius, and some others, however, think that this refers to Christians in general; and that the apostle means to caution them against subjecting themselves to needless rites and customs which the false teachers would impose on them. Others have supposed (as Doddridge) that it means that they should not sell themselves into slavery; but assuredly a caution of this kind was not needful. The view given above I regard as the interpretation demanded by the connection. And in this view it would promote contentment, and would even prevent their taking any improper measures to disturb the relations of social life, by the high and solemn consideration that even in that relation they were in common with all Christians, the true and real servants of God. They belonged to God, and they should serve Him. In all things which their masters commanded, that were in accordance with the will of God, and that could be done with a quiet conscience, they were to regard themselves as serving God; if at any time they were commanded to do that which God had forbidden, they were to remember that they were the servants of God, and that he was to be obeyed rather than man. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. be not ye&#8212;Greek, "become not ye." Paul here changes from "thou" (1Co 7:21) to "ye." Ye all are "bought" with the blood of Christ, whatever be your earthly state (1Co 6:20). "Become not servants to men," either externally, or spiritually; the former sense applying to the free alone: the latter to Christian freemen and slaves alike, that they should not be servile adherents to their party leaders at Corinth (1Co 3:21, 22; Mt 23:8-10; 2Co 11:20); nor indeed slaves to men generally, so far as their condition admits. The external and internal conditions, so far as is attainable, should correspond, and the former be subservient to the latter (compare 1Co 7:21, 32-35).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> What <span class="bld">price</span> we <span class="bld">are bought with, </span> we heard, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1 Corinthians 6:20</a></span>: the apostle there pressed it upon us as our duty to glorify God with our bodies and our spirits; here he presseth upon us another duty, viz. upon that consideration not to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the servants of men; </span> by which some think he forbiddeth the selling themselves as slaves to infidels; others think that he only forbiddeth <span class="ital">eye-service, </span> as the apostle calls it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-6.htm" title="Not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart;">Ephesians 6:6</a></span>; while in the mean time they might be the servants of men, if they served them <span class="ital">as the servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart; with good will doing service, as to the Lord, and not to men.</span> But the most probable interpretation is: Be not servants to the lusts of men: wherein you can serve men, and in the same actions also serve God, and be obedient to his will, you may be the servants of men; but be not servants of men in such actions wherein, to serve them, you must disobey God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye are bought with a price,.... Some read these words interrogatively, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-18.htm">1 Corinthians 7:18</a>, "are ye bought with a price?" and suppose them directed to such who had bought out their time of servitude with a sum of money, and ought not to return to their former condition; but they are rather to be read affirmatively, and to be understood of all, whether freemen or servants, that are bought with the inestimable price of Christ's blood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a> and contain in them a reason why such as are called by the grace of God, whilst in a state of civil servitude, are Christ's freemen, because they are redeemed by him from sin, Satan, the law, and from among men; and also why such as are called by the grace of God, being in a state of civil liberty, are Christ's servants, because he has purchased them with his blood, and therefore has a right unto them, both to their persons and service: <p>be not ye the servants of men: not that the apostle dissuades such as are redeemed by Christ, and are believers in him, from being the servants of men in a civil sense; for this would be to contradict himself, who here and elsewhere exhorts servants to continue in the service of their masters, and to perform it heartily and cheerfully, and with great sincerity and integrity; but his meaning is, that since they were redeemed from a vain conversation by the blood of Christ, they should not be servants to the lusts of men, nor obey them in things sinful and wicked, which were contrary to law and Gospel, and which were made unlawful by the word of God, and were a breach of the command of their Lord and master Christ; nor should they in matters of religion and the worship of God submit to the authority of any set of men whatever, or be subject to the doctrines and commandments of men; whether these relate to Jewish ceremonies, or Gentile superstitions, or be a mixture of both: they were to call no man master upon earth; nor suffer any to lord it over them, as the false teachers very much did in this church; but to acknowledge Christ, who had bought them to be their only Lord and master. The allusion seems to he to a tradition of the Jews, that the Israelites being redeemed out of Egypt were the servants of God, and not of men (p); <p>"R. Jochanan ben Zaccai was explaining this Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-6.htm">Exodus 21:6</a> how different the ear is from all the members of the body; says the holy blessed God, the ear that heard my voice on Mount Sinai, at the time I said, the children of Israel are my servants,  , and "not servants to servants"; and this goes and gets itself a master, let it be bored: R. Simeon ben Ribbi was explaining the same Scripture, how different the door and the door post were from all the parts of the house; says the holy blessed God, the door and the door post, which were witnesses in Egypt, at the time that I passed by the threshold, and by the two door posts, and I said, the children of Israel are my servants, and not servants to servants, and I brought them out of bondage to liberty; and this goes and gets itself a master, let it be bored before them.'' <p>(p) T.

Paul designs that this should be applied to the mistaken submission shown on the part of the church to such as wished that men should break up or alter their civil relationships and other existing situations to please them, and in compliance with their solicitations and deceptive suggestions. This more specific reference of the warning, in itself conveyed in general terms, we may naturally gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-24.htm" title="Brothers, let every man, wherein he is called, therein abide with God.">1 Corinthians 7:24</a>. Instigations and seductions of this kind, arising partly, perhaps, from fanatical excitement, must plainly have occurred at Corinth in connection with circumstances of the details of which we are ignorant; for otherwise the whole of the minute instructions from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-17.htm" title="But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk.

The interpretation with which Chrysostom and Theophylact content themselves is therefore much too vague: that Paul is forbidding men-pleasing generally, and compliance with immoral demands. So also Theodoret’s view, that he enjoins <span class="greekheb">μὴ δουλοπρεπὲς ἔχειν φρόνημα</span>. Osiander and Neander’s rendering is too general also (“every kind of wrong dependence”). It is altogether alien to the context, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-17.htm" title="But as God has distributed to every man, as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk. And so ordain I in all churches....">1 Corinthians 7:17-24</a>, to suppose that <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπων</span> refers to Paul, Cephas, Apollos, etc. (Rückert), and that the meaning is substantially the same as had been expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-21.htm" title="Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;">1 Corinthians 3:21</a> by <span class="greekheb">μηδεὶς καυχάσθω ἐν ἀνθρώποις</span> (Hofmann). Equally out of accordance with the subject in hand is Billroth’s exposition (given before by Vatablus), that the apostle exhorts <span class="ital">the slaves</span> not to do their service <span class="ital">for the sake of men</span>, but for the Lord’s sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-22.htm" title=" Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men pleasers; but in singleness of heart, fearing God;">Colossians 3:22</a>). Heydenreich, on the other hand, holds (with Menochius, Hammond, Knatchbull, Mosheim, Michaelis, Zachariae) that he is admonishing <span class="ital">the freemen</span> not to sell themselves into slavery. But, even putting out of account the second person plural, which directs the words to the readers generally, were that the meaning, Paul would undoubtedly have called attention to a new illustration of his rule, as he does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-18.htm" title="Is any man called being circumcised? let him not become uncircumcised.
