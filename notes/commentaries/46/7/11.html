Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But and if she depart - If she have withdrawn by a rash and foolish act; if she has attempted to dissolve the marriage vow, she is to remain unmarried, or be reconciled. She is not at liberty to marry another. This may refer, I suppose, to instances where wives, ignorant of the rule of Christ, and supposing that they had a right to separate themselves from their husbands, had rashly left them, and had supposed that the marriage contract was dissolved. Paul tells them that this was impossible; and that if they had so separated from their husbands, the pure laws of Christianity, did not recognize this right, and they must either be reconciled to their husbands, or remain alone. The marriage tie was so sacred that it could not be dissolved by the will of either party.<p>Let her remain unmarried - That is, let her not marry another.<p>Or be reconciled to her husband - Let this be done, if possible. If it cannot be, let her remain unmarried. It was a duty to be reconciled if it was possible. If not, she should not violate her vows to her husband so far as to marry another. It is evident that this rule is still binding, and that no one who has separated from her husband, whatever be the cause, unless there be a regular divorce, according to the law of Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>, can be at liberty to marry again.<p>And let not the husband - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>. This right, granted under the Jewish law, and practiced among all the pagan, was to be taken away wholly under the gospel. The marriage tie was to be regarded as sacred; and the tyranny of man over woman was to cease. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

It signifieth, if she be departed, and so is as well significative of a being parted from her husband by a judicial act of divorce, as of a voluntary departing. The Jews were wont to give bills of divorce to their wives for any trivial cause. The word is to be interpreted as well of any legal divorce, not according to the true meaning of the Divine law, as concerning a voluntary secession; in which case the apostle commandeth that she should marry to no other: the reason is plain, because no such cause of divorce broke the bond of marriage; she was yet the wife of her former husband in God’s eye and account, and committed adultery if she married to another, as our Saviour had determined, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a> 19:9</span>.

There were great facilities for divorce, both under the law of Greece and Rome, in St Paul’s day, but the facilities were greater for the husband than for the wife. At Athens the husband could dismiss his wife at will. At Sparta failure of issue was regarded as a sufficient reason. Thus the Ephors, we are told by Herodotus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-39.htm" title="The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 7:39</a>) sent for Anaxandrides and urged him, lest the race of Eurysthenes should be extinct, to put away his wife. Something similar is related by the same historian (vi. 61–3) of Ariston. So in Roman law, the husband had originally the full disposal of the wife’s person and liberty, but this harsh regulation was resented by the wives, and in the days of the empire the wife also obtained the power of divorce. Cicero and Cæsar both divorced their wives. Juvenal (<span class="ital">Sat</span>. vi. 229, 230) speaks of the fatal facility of divorce, possessed by the wives in his day: the then accepted theory being that whatever put an end to conjugal affection was sufficient to dissolve marriage. See Art. <span class="ital">Divortium</span> in Smith’s <span class="ital">Dictionary of Antiquities</span>, and Merivale’s <span class="ital">History of Rome</span>, Vol. iv. The Jewish law of divorce was also very lax. See St <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-31.htm" title="It has been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of divorce:...">Matthew 5:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/7.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐὰν</span>, <span class="ital">if</span>) This word also at the end of this verse is to be understood of the husband.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ χωρισθῇ</span>, <span class="ital">she even be separated</span> [<span class="ital">be put away</span>: not ‘<span class="ital">depart</span>,’ as if of herself, Engl.
