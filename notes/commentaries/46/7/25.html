Ought they to give them in marriage? The answer occupies to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-38.htm" title="So then he that gives her in marriage does well; but he that gives her not in marriage does better.">1Corinthians 7:38</a>. On this subject the Apostle states that he has no actual command from Christ. It was a point to which our Lord had not directly alluded in His teaching, and so the Apostle gives his opinion as one who has obtained mercy to be a faithful instructor. The contrast here is not between Paul inspired by the Lord and Paul not inspired, but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12</a>, between Paul quoting the words of Christ and Paul himself instructing as an inspired Apostle.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-25.htm" title="Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my judgment, as one that has obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful....">1 Corinthians 7:25-26</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now concerning virgins </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">παρθενων</span>, translated <span class="ital">virgins, </span>denotes persons of either sex, who never were married.

These are they which follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed from among men, being the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.">Revelation 14:4</a> is an undoubted example; <span class="ital">these are they which were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. </span>The apostle seems here to speak of such single persons as were in their fathers’ families. <span class="ital">I have no commandment of the Lord </span>— Namely, delivered during his ministry, or communicated by any particular revelation. Nor was it necessary he should; for the apostles wrote nothing which was not divinely inspired, but with this difference, sometimes they delivered what Christ had expressly declared or enjoined during his personal ministry, or what was made known to them by a particular revelation, and a special commandment; at other times they wrote from the divine light, which abode with them, the standing treasure of the Spirit of God. And this also was not their own private opinion, but a divine rule of faith and practice to the Christians, or a directory to them in cases of difficulty. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="But I speak this by permission, and not of commandment.">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>. <span class="ital">Yet I give my judgment </span>— Guided by the Holy Spirit, not only to deliver sound doctrine, but faithful and wholesome advice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>. <span class="ital">As one that hath obtained mercy to be faithful </span>— As one whom God hath in mercy made faithful in my apostolic office, who therefore faithfully deliver what I receive from him.

The same word, <span class="greekheb">αναγκη</span>, is used for affliction arising from outward circumstances, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-23.htm" title="But woe to them that are with child, and to them that give suck, in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath on this people.">Luke 21:23</a>. By mentioning the present distress as the chief, or only thing which rendered a single state proper, the apostle hath prevented us from fancying that celibacy is a more holy or perfect state than matrimony. The one or the other, as Macknight justly observes, is proper, according to the circumstances in which persons are placed. <span class="ital">I say that it is good for a man so to be — </span>“Though the English word <span class="ital">man, </span>like its corresponding word in Greek and Latin, denotes both sexes, the Greek word here might have been translated <span class="ital">a person, </span>better to agree with the signification of the word <span class="ital">virgin, </span>which, as we have just observed, denotes an unmarried person of either sex.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:25-35 Considering the distress of those times, the unmarried state was best. Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not concerning virgins - This commences the "third" subject on which the opinion of Paul seems to have been asked by the church at Corinth - whether it was proper that those who had unmarried daughters, or wards, should give them in marriage. The reason why this question was proposed may have been, that many in the church at Corinth were the advocates of celibacy, and this, perhaps, on two grounds:<p>(1) Some may have supposed that in the existing state of things - the persecutions and trials to which Christians were exposed - it would be advisable that a man who had unmarried daughters, or wards, should keep them from the additional cares and trials to which they would be exposed with a family; and,<p>(2) Some may have already been the advocates for celibacy, and have maintained that that state was more favorable to piety, and was altogether to be preferred. It is known that that opinion had an early prevalence, and gave rise to the establishment of "nunneries" in the papal church; an opinion that has everywhere been attended with licentiousness and corruption. It is not improbable that there may have been advocates for this opinion even in the church of Corinth; and it was well, therefore, that the authority of an apostle should be employed to sanction and to honor the marriage union.<p>I have no commandment ... - No positive, express revelation; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>.<p>Yet I give my judgment - I give my opinion, or advice; see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>.<p>As one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord - As a Christian; one who has been pardoned, whose mind has been enlightened, and who has been endued with the grace of God.<p>To be faithful - Faithful to my God. As one who would not give advice for any selfish, or mercenary, or worldly consideration; as one known to act from a desire to honor God, and to seek the best interests of the church, even though there is no explicit command. The advice of "such" a man - a devoted, faithful, self-denying, experienced Christian - is entitled to respectful deference, even where there is no claim to inspiration. Religion qualifies to give advice; and the advice of a man who has no selfish ends to gratify, and who is known to seek supremely the glory of God, should not be disregarded or slighted. Paul had a special claim to give this advice, because he was the founder of the congregation at Corinth. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. no commandment of the Lord: yet &#8230; my judgment&#8212;I have no express revelation from the Lord commanding it, but I give my judgment (opinion); namely, under the ordinary inspiration which accompanied the apostles in all their canonical writings (compare 1Co 7:40; 1Co 14:37; 1Th 4:15). The Lord inspires me in this case to give you only a recommendation, which you are free to adopt or reject&#8212;not a positive command. In the second case (1Co 7:10, 11) it was a positive command; for the Lord had already made known His will (Mal 2:14, 15; Mt 5:31, 32).

Whether they should continue in the same state or not, whether they should marry or not, was one of the cases put to the apostle, and which the Corinthians wrote to him about, and to which he returns this answer: <p>I have no commandment of the Lord: neither in the Old Testament, in the law of Moses, or writings of the prophets; nothing is therein enjoined concerning celibacy, or commanding persons to live a single life; but on the contrary there are many things directing and exciting to a marriage state; nor had the apostle any command from the Lord Jesus Christ, under the Gospel dispensation, obliging to virginity; nor any special orders, or peculiar revelation from the Spirit of God, fixing and settling this point: <p>yet I give my judgment, what will be most advisable, convenient, and prudent to be done, considering persons, times, and circumstances. The apostle does not make use of his power and authority, as such, to make decrees, and prescribe rules, binding on the consciences of men; only humbly and modestly gives his opinion, which if thought well of, might be followed by them: and the more to engage them to take his advice, he adds, <p>as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful; the meaning of which is, not that he, through the goodness and mercy of the Lord, had with great integrity preserved his virginity, and so proposes himself, as an instance and example of retaining it; for it is not certain, that though the apostle was now single, that he had never been married; it seems rather that he had, and therefore this cannot be his sense; nor does he refer to his faithfulness, to the Gospel committed to his trust, and the faithful discharge of his whole ministerial service, and which was owing to divine grace and mercy; but to that plainness, honesty, and integrity, which appeared in the whole course and conduct of his life, and in all his conversation with men; and particularly in giving advice about any matter, or declaring his sentiments on any subject: and when a man is free and faithful, and openly and honestly tells his mind, it greatly recommends him, and commands attention and regard to what he says; and faithfulness, it may be observed, considered in this sense, is not of nature, but of grace; it is obtained not by a man's own power and strength, but by the grace and mercy of God; to which it is here ascribed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{16}</span> Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord: yet I give my <span class="cverse3">{s}</span> judgment, as <span class="cverse3">{t}</span> one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</span><p>(16) He commands virginity to no man, yet he persuades and praised it for another reason, that is, both for the necessity of the present time, because the faithful could scarce abide in any place, and use the commodities of this present life because of persecution.

Therefore on that point, which falls under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΑΓῊΝ</span></span></span>, the Lord had expressly suggested to the apostle what he should write, but on this point, which falls under <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝΏΜΗΝ</span></span></span>, it was not necessary to make any suggestion; for, the apostles wrote nothing, which was not inspired, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΘΕΌΠΝΕΥΣΤΟΝ</span></span></span>; but they sometimes had a special revelation and command, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1 Corinthians 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a> : they derived the rest from the habitual faith, which had taken its rise within them from their experience of the Lord’s mercy; as in this verse; and also from the treasury of the Spirit of God [which they possessed], <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm" title="But she is happier if she so abide, after my judgment: and I think also that I have the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 7:40</a> : and consequently in cases like this, they might very freely apply various methods according to the variety of circumstances and persons, as their holy feelings [affections of mind] allowed, and they might give up their own right, humble or reprove themselves, prefer others to themselves, beg, entreat, exhort (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm" title="We then, as workers together with him, beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain.">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="For though I made you sorry with a letter, I do not repent, though I did repent: for I perceive that the same letter has made you sorry, though it were but for a season.">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-17.htm" title="That which I speak, I speak it not after the Lord, but as it were foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.">2 Corinthians 11:17</a>, note), at one time treat with greater severity, at another with greater mildness; and hence Paul, for example, uses the softer word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΟΜΊΖΩ</span></span></span>, and not <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>. He therefore here also, though without <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΤΑΓῊΝ</span></span></span>, wrote those things, which nevertheless exactly agreed with the mind of the Lord, who willed it, that this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΓΝΏΜΗ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">opinion</span>, alone should be given. But at the same time, the apostle faithfully informs us, according to what principle every thing was written (a modesty from which how far I would ask, has the style of the Pope departed?) and furnishes a proof, that those, who have already sufficient assistance [safeguard] from the word and Spirit of God, should not demand anything extraordinary.—<span class="greekheb">ὡς ἠλεημένος</span>, <span class="ital">as having obtained mercy</span>) The mercy of the Lord makes men faithful; faith makes a man a true casuist.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ Κυρίου</span>, <span class="ital">from the Lord</span>) Christ.—<span class="greekheb">πιστὸ<span class="bld"><span class="ital">ς</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">faithful</span>) having faith in the Lord; evincing that faith both to Him and to men.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[59] Taylor’s translation of this passage is as follows: “What is called upright decision is the right judgment of the equitable man; but pardon is an upright judiciary decision of the equitable man, and the decision is right which is made by a man observant of truth.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 25-40.</span> - <span class="accented">Advice respecting the unmarried.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning virgins.</span> This is doubtless another reference to questions contained in the letter from Corinth. <span class="cmt_word">No commandment of the Lord</span>.

In every other case in the New Testament the meaning is unquestionable. </body></html>
