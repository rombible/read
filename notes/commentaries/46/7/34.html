Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Between a wife and a virgin, - Between a woman that is married and one that is unmarried. The apostle says that a similar difference between the condition of her that is married and her that is unmarried takes place, which had been observed between the married and the unmarried man. The Greek word here (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  memeristai) may mean, "is divided," and be rendered, "the wife and the virgin are divided in the same manner;" that is, there is the same difference in their case as exists between the married and the unmarried man.<p>The unmarried women ... - Has more advantages for attending to the things of religion; has fewer temptations to neglect her proper duty to God.<p>Both in body and in spirit - Entirely holy; that she may be entirely devoted to God. Perhaps in her case the apostle mentions the "body," which he had not done in the case of the man, because her temptation would be principally in regard to that - the danger of endeavoring to decorate and adorn her person to please her husband,<p>How she may please her husband - The apostle here intends, undoubtedly, to intimate that there were dangers to personal piety in the married life, which would not occur in a state of celibacy; and that the unmarried female would have greater opportunities for devotion and usefulness than if married. And he intimates that the married female would be in danger of losing her zeal and marring her piety, by attention to her husband, and by a constant effort to please him. Some of the ways in which this might be done are the following:<p>(1) As in the former case <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, her affections might be transferred from God to the partner of her life.<p>(2) her time will be occupied by an attention to him and to his will; and there would be danger that that attention would be allowed to interfere with her hours of secret retirement and communion with God.<p>(3) her time will be necessarily broken in upon by the cares of a family, and she should therefore guard with special vigilance, that she may redeem time for secret communion with God.<p>(4) the time which she before gave to benevolent objects, may now be given to please her husband. Before her marriage she may have been distinguished for zeal, and for active efforts in every plan of doing good; subsequently, she may lay aside this zeal, and withdraw from these plans, and be as little distinguished as others.<p>(5) her piety may be greatly injured by false notions of what should be done to please her husband. If he is a worldly and fashionable man, she may seek to please him by "gold, and pearls, and costly array." Instead of cultivating the ornament of "a meek and quiet spirit," her main wish may be to decorate her person, and render herself attractive by the adorning of her person rather than of her MinD.<p>(6) if he is opposed to religion, or if he has lax opinions on the subject, or if he is sceptical and worldly, she will be in danger of relaxing in her views in regard to the strictness of Christianity, and of becoming conformed to his. She will insensibly become less strict in regard to Sunday, the Bible, the prayer meeting, the Sunday School, the plans of Christian benevolence, the doctrines of the gospel.<p>(7) to please him, she will be found in the frivilous circle, perhaps in the assembly room, or even the theater, or amidst companies of gaiety and amusement, and will forget that she is professedly devoted only to God. And,<p>(8) She is in danger, as the result of all this, of forsaking her old religious friends, the companions of purer, brighter days, the humble and devoted friends of Jesus; and of seeking society among the frivilous, the rich, the proud, the worldly. Her piety thus is injured; she becomes worldly and vain, and less and less like Christ; until heaven, perhaps, in mercy smites her idol, and he dies and leaves her again to the blessedness of single-hearted devotion to God. O! how many a Christian female has thus been injured by an unhappy marriage with a frivilous and worldly man! How often has the church occasion to mourn over piety that is dimmed, benevolence that is quenched, zeal that is extinguished by devotion to a frivilous and worldly husband! How often does humble piety weep over such a scene! How often does the cause of sacred charity sigh! How often is the Redeemer wounded in the house of his friends! And O how often does it become necessary for God to interpose, and to remove by death the object of the affection of his wandering child, and to clothe her in the habiliments of mourning, and to bathe her cheeks in tears, that "by the sadness of the countenance her heart may be made better." Who can tell how many a widow is made such from this cause; who can tell how much religion is injured by thus stealing away the affections from God? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>34. difference also&#8212;Not merely the unmarried and the married man differ in their respective duties, but also the wife and the virgin. Indeed a woman undergoes a greater change of condition than a man in contracting marriage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> There is the same difference between a married woman and a single woman, as there is between a married man and a single man. If a woman be unmarried, and be piously disposed, she hath leisure and opportunity enough to mind the things of God; but if she be married, she will then be obliged to attend secular affairs, to take care for her family, and to please her husband. It is the same thing that was before said of the man. The sense is, that a conjugal relation draws along with it many diversions, from which a single life is free. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There is difference also between a wife and a virgin,.... The word  translated "there is difference", stands in some copies at the end of the last verse, and in the Vulgate Latin and Ethiopic versions, by which it is rendered, "and is divided"; referring to the married man, whose thoughts are distracted with the cares of the world, and his mind divided between the Lord and his wife, between the things that please the one, and those that please the other; so that he cannot attend upon the Lord without distraction, as the unmarried person may; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-35.htm">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>. But the more generally received reading is what we follow; in which words the apostle shows, that there is just the same difference between a married and an unmarried woman, as there is between a married and an unmarried man. There is no difference in their nature, nor sex, but in their state and condition, and in the cares which involve the one and the other. <p>The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord; not everyone that is unmarried, but one that has the grace of God, being in a single state; as such an one is more at leisure, and can more conveniently attend on the service of the Lord, so she ought, and generally speaking does: and her end in so doing is, <p>that she may be holy both in body and in spirit; not in body only, but in spirit also; for outward chastity, without internal holiness, will be of little avail: but as a close adherence to the Lord, and to his worship and service, may be a means of preserving from external pollutions of the body, so likewise of carrying on the internal work of grace upon the soul; not that it is to be thought that unmarried persons are the only ones that are holy in body and spirit; there are some that are so in neither; and there are many married persons that are chaste in their bodies, and possess their vessels in sanctification and honour, and are blessed with inward spiritual purity. <p>But she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband; not by beautifying and adorning herself with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; though this is all that some care for; but with good works, taking care of her household and family affairs, bringing up her children in an orderly manner, honouring and obeying her husband, doing everything to oblige him, and to engage his love and affection to her, as becomes her; nor is this said of her by way of criticism, only that such is her state and situation in life, that she has not the opportunities and advantages the unmarried person has of serving the Lord; on which account the single life is represented as most advisable to abide in. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is difference <i>also</i> between a wife and a virgin.

The way in which <span class="greekheb">μερίζεσθαι</span> is used (see Reiche, <span class="ital">Comment. crit.</span> I. p. 195) to denote division into different tendencies, views, party-positions, is well known (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:...">Matthew 12:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/3-24.htm" title="And if a kingdom be divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand....">Mark 3:24-26</a>; Polybius, viii. 23. 9; Herodian, iii. 10. 6, iv. 3. 3); but the expression is <span class="ital">selected</span> here in reference to the different kinds of <span class="greekheb">μεριμνᾶν</span>.

The simple rendering: “<span class="ital">There is a difference</span>” (Chrysostom, Luther, Grotius, Mosheim, Zachariae, Heydenreich, and others), would still conduct one back to the sense <span class="ital">divisa est</span>, but would give too general and meaningless an idea.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Μεμέρ</span>. is in the <span class="ital">singular</span>, because it stands at the head of the sentence, and <span class="greekheb">ἡ γυνὴ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἡ παρθένος</span> embraces the female sex as a whole made up of two halves.

This moral consecration to God of her whole personality, which she strives after, is the <span class="greekheb">πῶς ἀρέσει τῷ Κυρίῳ</span> <span class="ital">explicated</span>. One can hardly conceive that Paul <span class="ital">avoided</span> the latter phrase on the ground of possible misconstruction (Hofmann).

The betrothed maiden, in his opinion, is no longer <span class="greekheb">ἄγαμος</span>. But in the whole context there is only the simple distinction made between married and unmarried persons.

He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:...">1 Corinthians 7:32-34</a> that Paul, himself unwedded, looked “somewhat askance” upon marriage (Rückert). To assume any such onesidedness of view on his part would be a very hasty proceeding (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.">1 Corinthians 7:2</a>). On the contrary, what we have here is not his view of <span class="ital">how, from the nature of the case, things must necessarily subsist</span>,[1245] but only his <span class="ital">experience of how in point of fact they usually did subsist</span>. This experience he (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἄγαμος</span>) had arrived at, on the one hand, by consideration of his own case and that of many other unmarried persons; and, on the other, by observing the change of interests which was wont to set in with those who married. We have here, therefore, a purely <span class="ital">empirical</span> support for the preference of celibacy,—a preference, however, which with Paul is simply relative, depending upon the nearness of the Parousia and the end of the world, and also upon the subjective gift of being holy in body and spirit (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-4.htm" title="But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.">Acts 14:4</a>). The expectation of these events being so near has remained unfulfilled, and thereby is invalidated the Pauline support which has been often found in our text for celibacy, which, as a legal requirement, is in principle thoroughly un-Pauline (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-35.htm" title="And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare on you, but for that which is comely, and that you may attend on the Lord without distraction.">1 Corinthians 7:35</a>). The apostle, moreover, is speaking generally, and not to one special class among his readers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1245] Paul himself, it is plain, had intercourse with numbers of eminent servants and handmaids of the Lord (Priscilla, etc.) who were married. This in opposition to Cropp in the <span class="ital">Jahrb. f.

The Vulgate and Calvin, who are followed by many modern editors, translate thus: <span class="ital">He that is married careth for the things of this life, how he may please his wife, and is distracted. And the unmarried woman and the virgin</span> (some read <span class="ital">unmarried virgin</span>) <span class="ital">careth for the things of the Lord</span>. There are two objections to this rendering: (1) The term unmarried woman is a singular one to apply either to a widow, or to a married woman living apart from her husband; and (2) it is difficult to see how the Apostle could commend the latter in the face of his express prohibition of separation save in the particular case mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God has called us to peace....">1 Corinthians 7:15-16</a>.

Some of the best texts insert &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; and both before and after is divided, and join that verb with the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, so that it reads: careth for the things of the world how he may please his wife, and he is distracted.
