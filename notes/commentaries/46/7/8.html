Widows are here joined with those who have not been married, otherwise discussion might have arisen as to whether the Apostle had intended his advice for them also. It has been curiously conjectured (by Luther amongst others), from the passage where St. Paul recommends widows to “abide even as I.” that the Apostle was himself a widower. This, however, requires the word “unmarried” to be restricted to widowers, which is quite inadmissible; and even if such were admissible, the deduction from it that St. Paul was a widower could scarcely be considered logical. The almost universal tradition of the early Church was that St. Paul was never married, and unless we can imagine his having been married, and his wife dead before the stoning of St. Stephen which is scarcely possible (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a>), the truth of that tradition is evident. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-3.htm" title="And I entreat you also, true yoke fellow, help those women which labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and with other my fellow laborers, whose names are in the book of life.">Philippians 4:3</a>.) “Even as I;” that is, unmarried.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I....">1 Corinthians 7:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">I say, therefore </span>— I give this advice; <span class="ital">to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them — </span>It is a condition of life which will tend to promote their eternal welfare, that, <span class="ital">if </span>they conveniently can, <span class="ital">they abide even as I </span>— Namely, unmarried; for that Paul was then single is certain: and from <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-58.htm" title="And cast him out of the city, and stoned him: and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man's feet, whose name was Saul.">Acts 7:58</a>, compared with the following parts of the history, it seems probable that he always was so. It may not be improper to observe, that many of the things which the apostle delivers here, as also chap. 14., and in some other parts of this epistle, are rather to be considered as advices about what was best to be done in many particular cases, to which the general precepts, or doctrine of the gospel revealed to this apostle, did not descend, than as commands, enjoining these things to the believers, under the penalty of their contracting guilt, and exposing themselves to the divine displeasure, if they did not comply with them. Yet these also were directions, or counsels of the Lord, concerning what was expedient to be done, and were delivered to the apostle by the infallible inspiration of the Holy Spirit, (as appears by comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-37.htm" title="If any man think himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.">1 Corinthians 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-17.htm" title="When I therefore was thus minded, did I use lightness? or the things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be yes yes, and no no?">2 Corinthians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-1.htm" title="Furthermore then we beseech you, brothers, and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk and to please God, so you would abound more and more....">1 Thessalonians 4:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-8.htm" title="He therefore that despises, despises not man, but God, who has also given to us his holy Spirit.">1 Thessalonians 4:8</a>; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-40.htm" title="Let all things be done decently and in order.">1 Corinthians 14:40</a>,) and were faithfully delivered by him; and therefore the assent of the Corinthians is required to them as such.

Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom.

It here means simply those who were at that time unmarried, and his reasoning applies to both classes.<p>And to widows - The apostle specifies these, though he had not specified "widowers" particularly. The reason of this distinction seems to be, that he considers more particularly the case of those females who had never been married, in the close of the chapter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-25.htm">1 Corinthians 7:25</a>.<p>That they abide - That they remain, in the present circumstances, unmarried; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm">1 Corinthians 7:26</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. to the unmarried&#8212;in general, of both sexes (1Co 7:10, 11).<p>and widows&#8212;in particular.<p>even as I&#8212;unmarried (1Co 9:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">the unmarried and widows, </span> it is apparent that Paul means virgins that were never married, and such as, having been once married, had lost their husbands: though the first word, in the Greek, had been significative enough of persons in both these states; yet the apostle’s using of two words, makes it past dispute; when he saith, it is good for such to be as he was, his meaning is, that it was better with respect to the present circumstances of Christians, or it was convenient, in which notion <span class="ital">good</span> is often taken, not for what is absolutely good; and indeed the nature of all good lieth in the conveniency or suitableness of the thing so called to us; and though in the Divine precepts there is always such a suitableness, so as they must be always good, yet in other things, which God hath left to our liberty, (such as is this of marriage), a thing may be good or evil, as the circumstances of several persons, yea, of the same person, may vary. St. Paul considereth only the circumstances of the world common to all Christians, and upon them, determines this goodness, supposing the circumstances of the particular person not to rule otherwise. His not saying, it is good for them not to marry, but to be as he was, hath bred a question of no great import to be determined: Whether Paul was ever married or not? In the determination of which the ancients could not agree; but it is not worth spending our time about, considering that all agree he was at this time unmarried, which is all he doth here mean: if St. Paul was never married, we are sure Peter was, for we read of his <span class="ital">wife’s mother sick of a fever, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-30.htm" title="But Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, and immediately they tell him of her.">Mark 1:30</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>I say therefore to the unmarried and widows,....
