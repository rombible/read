From these, and many other examples which might be adduced, it is evident that the word in this verse does not imply that the apostle was in any doubt whether he was inspired in giving this judgment. It is only a soft way of expressing his certain knowledge of his own inspiration, and may have been used ironically in reference to, and reproof of, the false teachers and others who called his inspiration in question. Whoever therefore would conclude from hence that St. Paul was not certain he had the Spirit of Christ, neither understands the true import of the words, nor considers how expressly he lays claim to the Spirit, both in this epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-16.htm" title="For who has known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him?

In this view, the general meaning is plain. Children should seek and follow the directions of their parents as to marriage. And parents should consult their children's wishes; and not reckon they have power to do with them, and dictate just as they please, without reason. The whole is closed with advice to widows. Second marriages are not unlawful, so that it is kept in mind, to marry in the Lord. In our choice of relations, and change of conditions, we should always be guided by the fear of God, and the laws of God, and act in dependence on the providence of God. Change of condition ought only to be made after careful consideration, and on probable grounds, that it will be to advantage in our spiritual concerns.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The wife is bound ... - ; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>.<p>Only in the Lord - That is, only to one who is a Christian; with a proper sense of her obligations to Christ, and so as to promote his glory. The apostle supposed that could not be done if she were allowed to marry a pagan, or one of a different religion. The same sentiment he advances in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>, and it was his intention, undoubtedly, to affirm that it was proper for a widow to marry no one who was not a Christian. The reasons at that time would be obvious:<p>(1) They could have no sympathy and fellow-feeling on the most important of all subjects, if the one was a Christian and the other a pagan; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm">2 Corinthians 6:14-15</a>, etc.<p>(2) if she should marry a pagan, would it not be showing that she had not as deep a conviction of the importance and truth of her religion as she ought to have? If Christians were required to be "separate," to be "a special people," not "to be conformed to the world," how could these precepts be obeyed if the society of a pagan was voluntarily chosen, and if she became united to him for life?<p>(3) she would in this way greatly hinder her usefulness; put herself in the control of one who had no respect for her religion, and who would demand her time and attention, and thus interfere with her attendance on the public and private duties of religion, and the offices of Christian charity.<p>(4) she would thus greatly endanger her piety. There would be danger from the opposition, the taunts, the sneers of the enemy of Christ; from the secret influence of living with a man who had no respect for God; from his introducing her into society that was irreligious, and that would tend to mar the beauty of her piety, and to draw her away from simple-hearted devotion to Jesus Christ. And do not these reasons apply to similar cases now? And if so, is not the law still binding? Do not such unions now, as really as they did then, place the Christian where there is no mutual sympathy on the subject dearest to the Christian heart? Do they not show that she who forms such a union has not as deep a sense of the importance of piety, and of the pure and holy nature of her religion as she ought to have? Do they not take time from God and from charity; break up plans of usefulness, and lead away from the society of Christians, and from the duties of religion? Do they not expose often to ridicule, to reproach, to persecution, to contempt, and to pain? Do they not often lead into society, by a desire to please the partner in life, where there is no religion, where God is excluded, where the name of Christ is never heard, and where the piety is marred, and the beauty of simple Christian piety is dimmed? and if so, are not such marriages contrary to the law of Christ? I confess, that this verse, to my view, proves that all such marriages are a violation of the New Testament; and if they are, they should not on any plea be entered into; and it will be found, in perhaps nearly all instances, that they are disastrous to the piety of the married Christian, and the occasion of ultimate regret, and the cause of a loss of comfort, peace, and usefulness in the married life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>39. bound by the law&#8212;The oldest manuscripts omit "by the law."<p>only in the Lord&#8212;Let her marry only a Christian (2Co 6:14).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle all along this chapter hath been speaking to several cases, which the church of Corinth had put to him concerning marriage; some that concerned persons already married, others that concerned such as were single, having been never married; he shutteth up his discourse with advice which relateth to such as had lost their husbands, with reference to second marriages. As to this he determineth, that no woman might marry again while her first husband lived; that is, unless her husband, be legally divorced from her for adultery, or unless her husband, being a heathen, had voluntarily deserted her: but if her husband were dead, she might marry to whom she would; yet she was not at such liberty, as that she might marry an unbeliever. Unbelievers are either heathens, or Christians in name, but such as are idolaters, or profane persons, or heretics, who hold such tenets as are inconsistent with any true faith in Jesus Christ. This phrase, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">only in the Lord, </span> seemeth to oblige godly women, not only to avoid marrying with heathens, but with nominal Christians; that is, such who, although they have been baptized, and own Christ with their tongues, yet hold such damnable opinions, or live such profane lives, or worship God in such an idolatrous manner, as is inconsistent with any true faith in Christ. The reason of the precept holds as well to the latter as to the former. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The wife is bound by the law as long as her husband liveth,.... That is, she is bound to her husband, by the law of marriage, during his life; nor can the bond of marriage between them be dissolved but by the death of one of them, except in the cases of adultery, and wilful desertion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>. <p>But if her husband be dead; or "asleep", for so the word may be rendered; though it designs death: death is often expressed by sleeping in Scripture; for the dead will not always remain in such a state, but be raised from thence at the last day, just as persons are awaked out of sleep. The Alexandrian copy reads  "dead"; and so seems the Ethiopic version to have read. <p>She is at liberty to marry whom she will: so that second marriages are lawful, though condemned by many of the ancients: the liberty of a widow is greater than that of a virgin, because a virgin is under the power, and at the dispose of her parents; but a widow is at her own dispose; and death having dissolved her former obligation, she is at entire liberty to marry, or not marry, and to marry whom she pleases, that is not forbidden by the laws of God: <p>only in the Lord; not that it is absolutely necessary that her husband should be in the Lord, a converted person, a believer in Christ; though such an one should be most desirable and eligible: but either that she should continue in the possession of her faith in Christ, and not relinquish it for the sake of an husband; or that she enter into this state in the fear of the Lord, calling upon him, and consulting him in such an important affair; and take care that whom she marries is not within the line prohibited by the Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{18}</span> The wife is bound by the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> law as long as her husband liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she will; only in the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> Lord.</span><p>(18) That which he spoke of a widower, he speaks now of a widow, that is, that she may marry again, but that she does it in the fear of God.

CONTACT WITH IDOLATRY, 8–10. We have traced in the previous chapters the disastrous reaction of the old leaven upon the new Christian kneading at Cor[1215] But Christian society had its <span class="ital">external</span> as well as its internal problems—a fact already evident in the discussion of ch. 6 respecting the carrying of disputes to the heathen law-courts. A much larger difficulty, involving the whole problem of social intercourse between Christians and their heathen neighbours, had been raised by the Church Letter—the question <span class="greekheb">περὶ τῶν εἰδωλοθύτων</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>). <span class="ital">Was it lawful for a Christian to eat flesh that had been offered in sacrifice to an idol?</span> Social festivities commonly partook of a religious character, being conducted under the auspices of some deity, to whom libations were poured or to whom the animals consumed had been dedicated in sacrifice. The “idol’s house” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-10.htm" title="For if any man see you which have knowledge sit at meat in the idol's temple, shall not the conscience of him which is weak be emboldened to eat those things which are offered to idols;">1 Corinthians 8:10</a>) was a rendezvous for banquets. Much of the meat on sale in the markets and found on ordinary tables came from the temples; and without inquiry it was impossible to discriminate (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-25.htm" title="Whatever is sold in the shambles, that eat, asking no question for conscience sake:...">1 Corinthians 10:25-28</a>). Jewish rule was uncompromisingly strict upon this point; and the letter of the Jerusalem Council, addressed to the Churches of Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia, had directed “the brethren from among the Gentiles” to “abstain from <span class="ital">idolothyta</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-29.htm" title="That you abstain from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication: from which if you keep yourselves, you shall do well. Fare you well.">Acts 15:29</a>). The Cor[1216] Church, in consulting Paul, had expressed its own leaning towards liberty in this matter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-8.htm" title="I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I.">1 Corinthians 7:8</a>); what will the Ap. say? It is a real dilemma for him. He has to vindicate the broad principles of spiritual religion; at the same time he must avoid wounding Jewish feeling, and must guard Gentile weakness against the seductions of heathen feasts and against the peril of relapsing into idolatry through intercourse with unconverted kindred and neighbours. In theory Paul is for <span class="ital">freedom</span>, but in practice for great <span class="ital">restrictions</span> upon the use of idolothyta. (1) He admits that the question is decided in principle by the fundamental truth of religion, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that <span class="ital">God is one</span>, from which it follows that <span class="ital">the sacrifice to the idol is an invalid transaction</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?">1 Corinthians 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-26.htm" title="For the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof.">1 Corinthians 10:26</a>). But (2) many have not grasped this inference, being still in some sense under the spell of the idol; for them to eat would be sin, and <span class="ital">for their sake stronger-minded brethren should abstain</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/8-7.htm" title="However, there is not in every man that knowledge: for some with conscience of the idol to this hour eat it as a thing offered to an idol; and their conscience being weak is defiled....">1 Corinthians 8:7-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-23.htm" title="All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but all things edify not....">1 Corinthians 10:23-30</a>). To this effect (3) P. sets forth <span class="ital">his own example</span>, (<span class="ital">a</span>) in <span class="ital">the abridgment of</span> his personal <span class="ital">liberty for the good of others</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?...">1 Corinthians 9:1-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-1.htm" title="Be you followers of me, even as I also am of Christ.">1 Corinthians 11:1</a>), and (<span class="ital">b</span>) in <span class="ital">the jealous discipline of bodily appetite</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-23.htm" title="And this I do for the gospel's sake, that I might be partaker thereof with you.">1 Corinthians 9:23</a> ff.). The last consideration leads (4) to a solemn warning against <span class="ital">contamination by idolatry</span>, drawn (<span class="ital">a</span>) from <span class="ital">the early history of Israel</span>, and further (<span class="ital">b</span>) from <span class="ital">the communion of the Lord’s Table</span>, which utterly forbids participation in “the table of demons” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-1.htm" title="Moreover, brothers, I would not that you should be ignorant, how that all our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea;...">1 Corinthians 10:1-22</a>). These instances show in a manner evident to the good sense of the readers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-15.htm" title="I speak as to wise men; judge you what I say.">1 Corinthians 10:15</a>), that to take part in a heathen sacrificial feast is in effect a recognition of idolatry and an apostasy from Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1215] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1216] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>39, 40.

See St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-52.htm" title="And the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints which slept arose,">Matthew 27:52</a>; St <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-11.htm" title="These things said he: and after that he said to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.">John 11:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-60.htm" title="And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

St Paul uses it in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-30.htm" title="For this cause many are weak and sickly among you, and many sleep.">1 Corinthians 11:30</a> and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm" title="After that, he was seen of above five hundred brothers at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some are fallen asleep.">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-18.htm" title="Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ are perished.">1 Corinthians 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-20.htm" title="But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the first fruits of them that slept.">1 Corinthians 15:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-13.htm" title="But I would not have you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not, even as others which have no hope....">1 Thessalonians 4:13-15</a>. The same idea is found in St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-24.htm" title="He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but sleeps. And they laughed him to scorn.">Matthew 9:24</a>, and in the parallel passages in St Mark and St Luke, but the word employed in the Greek is different. The writers of the Old Testament also described death thus, as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods of the strangers of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.">Deuteronomy 31:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-10.htm" title="So David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.">1 Kings 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-2.htm" title="And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and everlasting contempt.">Daniel 12:2</a>. Thus death is robbed of half its terrors. It is a condition of partially, not wholly, suspended consciousness; a waiting of the soul, in union with its Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-14.htm" title="For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him.">1 Thessalonians 4:14</a>) until the great awakening. Calvin remarks that to infer from this passage that the soul, separated from the body, was without sense or intelligence, would be to say that it was without life. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="I knew a man in Christ above fourteen years ago, (whether in the body, I cannot tell; or whether out of the body, I cannot tell: God knows;) such an one caught up to the third heaven.">2 Corinthians 12:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">only in the Lord</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>. The marriage of widows was discountenanced, but not forbidden. Under certain circumstances it was even enjoined. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1 Timothy 5:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm" title="But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;">1 Timothy 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1 Timothy 5:14</a>.
