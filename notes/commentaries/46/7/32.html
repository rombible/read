Nevertheless such shall have trouble in the flesh: but I spare you.">1Corinthians 7:28</a>. I would spare you trouble; I also wish to have you free from anxious care. That is my reason for so advising you. And here the Apostle returns to the subject immediately under consideration, and shows here what he has been saying bears upon it. This element of anxious care must be borne in mind in considering the desirability or otherwise of marriage.<p>There are some important variations in the readings of these verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:">1Corinthians 7:32-34</a>) in the Greek MSS. The emendations required in the Greek text, from which the Authorised version is translated, are, I think, as follows:—Omit the full-stop after <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm" title="But he that is married cares for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife.">1Corinthians 7:33</a>, connecting it with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm" title="There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.">1Corinthians 7:34</a> by the insertion of the word “and.” Insert “and” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm" title="There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.">1Corinthians 7:34</a> before “a wife,” and the word “unmarried” after a wife.” The whole passage will then stand thus (rendering the Greek verb as it is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-13.htm" title="Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were you baptized in the name of Paul?">1Corinthians 1:13</a>, “divided,” and, not, as in the English version here, “a difference between”): <span class= "ital">The unmarried man careth for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord. But the married man careth for the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided in his interests </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> distracted). <span class= "ital">Also the wife that is unmarried </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> a widow, or divorced), <span class= "ital">and the unmarried virgin </span>(<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the maid who is free from any contract of marriage), <span class= "ital">cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and spirit. But she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.</span><p>The whole force of the passage is that married persons have, in the fulfilment of their obligations to each other, an additional interest and concern from which the unmarried are free. It must ever be distinctly borne in mind that this advice was given solely under the impression that the end of all earthly things was impending, and that the great trial and desolation was beginning to darken over the world. The Apostle who wrote these words of warning himself expressly condemns those who applied them as involving general moral obligations, and not as suited merely to temporary requirements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1Timothy 4:3</a>). He had himself at this time a strong personal inclination for a celibate life; but still he could enjoy and show a preference for the companionship of those who were evidently otherwise minded—he abode and wrought with Aquila and Priscilla his wife, at Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-3.htm" title="And because he was of the same craft, he stayed with them, and worked: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.">Acts 18:3</a>). We can still imagine circumstances arising in individual cases to which the principle enforced by the Apostle would apply. A man might feel it his duty to devote his life to some missionary enterprise, in which marriage would hamper his movements and impede his usefulness. Such an exceptional case would hence only establish the general rule. “It may not be out of place to recall” (writes Stanley, in his <span class= "ital">Exposition of St. Paul’s View of Celibacy</span>) “a celebrated instance of a similarly emphatic preference for celibacy on precisely similar grounds—not of abstract right, but of special expediency—in the well-known speech of our great Protestant Queen, when she declared that England was her husband and all Englishmen her children, and that she desired no higher character or fairer remembrance of her to be transmitted to posterity than this inscription engraved upon her tombstone: ‘Here lies Elizabeth, who lived and died a maiden queen.’”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness.

Notwithstanding, the apostle does not condemn marriage. How opposite are those to the apostle Paul who forbid many to marry, and entangle them with vows to remain single, whether they ought to do so or not! He exhorts all Christians to holy indifference toward the world. As to relations; they must not set their hearts on the comforts of the state. As to afflictions; they must not indulge the sorrow of the world: even in sorrow the heart may be joyful. As to worldly enjoyments; here is not their rest. As to worldly employment; those that prosper in trade, and increase in wealth, should hold their possessions as though they held them not. As to all worldly concerns; they must keep the world out of their hearts, that they may not abuse it when they have it in their hands. All worldly things are show; nothing solid. All will be quickly gone. Wise concern about worldly interests is a duty; but to be full of care, to have anxious and perplexing care, is a sin. By this maxim the apostle solves the case whether it were advisable to marry. That condition of life is best for every man, which is best for his soul, and keeps him most clear of the cares and snares of the world. Let us reflect on the advantages and snares of our own condition in life; that we may improve the one, and escape as far as possible all injury from the other. And whatever cares press upon the mind, let time still be kept for the things of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I would have you - I would advise you to such a course of life as should leave you without carefulness My advice is regulated by that wish, and that wish guides me in giving it.<p>Without carefulness - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  amerimnous). Without anxiety, solicitude, care; without such a necessary attention to the things of this life as to take off your thoughts and affections from heavenly objects; see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25-31</a>.<p>careth for the things that belong to the Lord - Margin, "The things of the Lord;" the things of religion. His attention is not distracted by the cares of this life; his time is not engrossed, and his affections alienated by an attendance on the concerns of a family, and especially by solicitude for them in times of trial and persecution. He can give his main attention to the things of religion. He is at leisure to give his chief thoughts and anxieties to the advancement of the Redeemer's kingdom. Paul's own example showed that this was the course which he preferred; and showed also that in some instances it was lawful and proper for a man to remain unmarried, and to give himself entirely to the work of the Lord. But the divine commandment <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28</a>, and the commendation everywhere bestowed upon marriage in the Scriptures, as well as the nature of the case, show that it was not designed that celibacy should be general. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32. without carefulness&#8212;I would have you to be not merely "without trouble," but "without distracting cares" (so the Greek).<p>careth&#8212;if he uses aright the advantages of his condition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But I would have you without carefulness; </span> the reason why I have advised (during the present distressed estate of the church) a single rather than a married life, for those to whom God hath given the gift of continency, is, that those who are Christians might live as free from such cares as divide and distract men’s and women’s minds, as they possibly can. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:</span> the single person that hath a spiritual heart, disposed to pious performances, being free from other distractions and cares, caused by worldly occasions, will spend all his thoughts about his duty toward God, and how to please him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I would have you without carefulness,.... This is another reason, by which the apostle confirms the advice he gives to virgins to remain such, because the married state is full of cares, whereas the single life is no more free from them; and therefore he wishes them to continue in such a state, that they might be without anxious and distracting cares of temporal things, things relating to the good decorum and sustenance of a family, and so be more free and at leisure for the service of God; which he illustrates, by showing the different cares that married and unmarried persons are involved in: <p>he that is unmarried, careth for the things that belong to the Lord; such as hearing the word, reading it, meditating upon it, praying to God and attending upon all ordinances, taking every opportunity to glorify God, and do good to others; but this is not to be understood as matter of fact, that unmarried persons are so studiously concerned for these things, or that this is the case of all of them; there are many unmarried persons think nothing about them; and are not at all concerned with them; but the meaning is, that such persons are more at leisure, and can more conveniently attend to these things, and ought so to do; and they that have the grace of God will be more or less solicitous to observe them: <p>how he may please the Lord; for when these things are attended to in faith and fear, from a principle of love, and with a view to the glory of God, the good of their own souls and others, they are well pleasing to the Lord; and though they are not meritorious of eternal life, yet they are acceptable to God through Jesus Christ, and will be taken notice of with approbation, and followed with a reward of grace another day. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I would have you without carefulness.

He leaves it to all to decide for themselves according to their sense of what is most desirable and becoming in their own case. The words translated here ‘care,’ ‘carefulness,’ have the idea, as in St <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on.
