There still remains one class of marriages concerning which differences of opinion existed—viz., mixed marriages. In a church like Corinth there would have been, no doubt, many cases where one of the partners was a heathen and the other a Christian, arising from the subsequent conversion of only one of the married couple. This subject is treated of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1Corinthians 7:12-16</a>. The words are emphatically, “If any man <span class= "ital">have already</span> a wife,” &c. The case of a Christian marrying a heathen is not alluded to. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>, the marriage of a Christian to a heathen is forbidden.<p><span class= "bld">Speak I, not the Lord.</span>—The Apostle has no word of Christ’s to quote on this point, it being one which did not arise during our Lord’s life. (See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="And to the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife depart from her husband:">1Corinthians 7:10</a>.)<p>It is to be noticed that the Apostle, in giving his own apostolic instruction on this point, does not use the word “command,” which he applied to our Lord’s teaching, but the less authoritative “speak.”<p><span class= "bld">A wife that believeth not.</span>—That is, a heathen. In some modern religious circles this whole passage has been used (as also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2Corinthians 6:14</a>) as if by “unbeliever” St. Paul meant a careless Christian, or one who, in modern phraseology, was not “converted.” The Apostle is referring under this designation to heathens, and the only case to which his teaching could now or ever apply would be when two heathens had been married, and subsequently only one had embraced the Christian faith. It is <span class= "ital">to</span> be noticed that both here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.">1Corinthians 7:13</a> the being “pleased to dwell” is put only in reference to the partner who is a heathen, for the Apostle takes for granted that after the instructions he here gives to the Christian partner, no such desire for separation will arise on the part of a Christian.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_corinthians/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away....">1 Corinthians 7:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">To the rest </span>— Who are married to unbelievers; <span class="ital">speak I </span>— By revelation from God; <span class="ital">not the Lord </span>— Who, during his ministry, gave no commandment concerning the matter. <span class="ital">If any brother hath a wife that believeth not </span>— Is a heathen, not yet converted; <span class="ital">let him not put her away</span> — If she consent to dwell with him. The Jews indeed were obliged, of old, to put away their idolatrous wives, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/10-3.htm" title="Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.">Ezra 10:3</a>; but their case was quite different. They were absolutely forbid to marry idolatrous women; but the persons here spoken of were married while they were both in a state of heathenism. It is probable that some of the more zealous Jewish converts, on the authority of that example of Ezra, contended that the Corinthians, who before their conversion had been married to idolaters, were bound to put away their spouses, if they continued in idolatry. Therefore the sincere part of the church having consulted the apostle on that question, he ordered such marriages to be continued, if the parties were willing to abide together. But as a difference of religion often proves an occasion of family quarrels, and there was danger, if the believers should be connected in marriage with idolaters and open sinners, lest they should be drawn by their partners into similar vices and abominations, the apostle advised them, in his second epistle, in contracting marriages after their conversion, by no means to marry idolaters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-14.htm" title="Be you not unequally yoked together with unbelievers: for what fellowship has righteousness with unrighteousness? and what communion has light with darkness?">2 Corinthians 6:14</a>. <span class="ital">And </span>— On the other hand, if any Christian woman have an unbelieving husband, whether he be a Jew or a Gentile, and he consent <span class="ital">to dwell with her, let her not leave </span>him — Nor put him away, as the expression <span class="greekheb">αφιετω αυτον </span>(the same that is used in the preceding verse) implies. And it is certain, though the Jewish law did not put it into a woman’s power to divorce her husband, yet that in those countries, in the apostle’s days, the wives among the heathen had a power of divorce as well as the husbands; and that the Roman women practised it in a most scandalous manner, as did several Jewish ladies of distinguished rank; and among them, even Josephus’s own wife. See Lardner’s <span class="ital">Credibility, </span>part I, vol. 2. p. 890, <span class="ital">Juv.

Divorce, at that time, was very common among both Jews and Gentiles, on very slight pretexts. Marriage is a Divine institution; and is an engagement for life, by God's appointment. We are bound, as much as in us lies, to live peaceably with all men, Ro 12:18, therefore to promote the peace and comfort of our nearest relatives, though unbelievers. It should be the labour and study of those who are married, to make each other as easy and happy as possible. Should a Christian desert a husband or wife, when there is opportunity to give the greatest proof of love? Stay, and labour heartily for the conversion of thy relative. In every state and relation the Lord has called us to peace; and every thing should be done to promote harmony, as far as truth and holiness will permit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But to the rest - "I have spoken in regard to the duties of the unmarried, and the question whether it is right and advisable that they should marry, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1-9</a>. I have also uttered the command of the Lord in regard to those who are married, and the question whether separation and divorce were proper. Now in regard to "the rest of the person's and cases" referred to, I will deliver my opinion." "The rest," or remainder, here referred to, relates particularly to the cases in which one party was a Christian and the other not. In the previous verses he had delivered the solemn, explicit law of Christ, that divorce was to take place on neither side, and in no instance, except agreeably. to the law of Christ; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm">Matthew 5:32</a>. That was settled by divine authority. In the subsequent verses he discusses a different question; whether a "voluntary separation" was not advisable and proper when the one party was a Christian and the other not. The word "rest" refers to these instances, and the questions which would arise under this inquiry.<p>Not the Lord - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-6.htm">1 Corinthians 7:6</a>. "I do not claim, in this advice, to be under the influence of inspiration; I have no express command on the subject from the Lord; but I deliver my opinion as a servant of the Lord <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-40.htm">1 Corinthians 7:40</a>, and as having a right to offer advice, even when I have no express command from God, to a church which I have founded, and which has consulted me on the subject." This was a case in which both he and they were to follow the principles of Christian prudence and propriety, when there was no express commandment. Many such cases may occur. But few, perhaps none, can occur, in which some Christian principle shall not be found, that will be sufficient to direct the anxious inquirer after truth and duty.<p>If any brother - Any Christian.<p>That believeth not - That is not a Christian; one who is a pagan.<p>And if she be pleased - If it seems best to her; if she consents; approves of living together still. There might be many cases where the wife or the husband, that was not a Christian, would be so opposed to Christianity, and so violent in their opposition, that they would not be willing to live with a Christian. When this was the case, the Christian husband or wife could not prevent the separation. When this was not the case, they were not to seek a separation themselves.<p>To dwell with him - To remain in connection with him as his wife, though they differed on the subject of religion.<p>Let him not put her away - Though she is a pagan, though opposed to his religion, yet the marriage vow is sacred and inviolable. It is not to be sundered by any change which can take place in the opinions of either party. It is evident that if a man were at liberty to dissolve the marriage tie, or to discard his wife when his own opinions were changed on the subject of religion, that it would at once destroy all the sacredness of the marriage union, and render it a nullity. Even, therefore, when there is a difference of opinion on the vital subject of religion, the tie is not dissolved; but the only effect of religion should be, to make the converted husband or wife more tender, kind, affectionate, and faithful than they were before; and all the more so as their partners are without the hopes of the gospel, and as they may be won to love the Saviour, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-16.htm">1 Corinthians 7:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. to the rest&#8212;the other classes (besides "the married," 1Co 7:10, where both husband and wife are believers) about whom the Corinthians had inquired, namely, those involved in mixed marriages with unbelievers.<p>not the Lord&#8212;by any direct command spoken by Him.<p>she be pleased&#8212;Greek, "consents": implying his wish in the first instance, with which hers concurs.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But to the rest speak I, not the Lord; </span> either as to the other part of your Epistle, or as to the cases of the rest mentioned in your Epistle, I shall give you my advice so far as I am instructed by the Holy Spirit of God, though our Lord Jesus Christ hath set no certain rule concerning them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If any brother hath a wife that believeth not: that believeth not, </span> both here and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-13.htm" title="And the woman which has an husband that believes not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him.">1 Corinthians 7:13</a></span>, signifieth, that hath not embraced the Christian faith, but still remaineth a pagan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And she be pleased to dwell with him; </span> if there be no other matter of difference between such persons, save only in matter of religion, <span class="ital">let him not</span> for that <span class="ital">put her away.</span> If a Christian man or woman had their choice to make, it were unlawful for either of them to make choice of a pagan for their yoke-fellow; but if, after marriage, either the husband or the wife embraceth the Christian faith, the other correlate still abiding a pagan, their difference in religion is not a sufficient ground for a separation: this seemeth to be the apostle’s meaning. The case seemeth a little different in the opinion of some divines, when the idolater or idolatress blasphemeth God and the true religion, and is continually tempting the correlate to apostacy: but it is hard to determine against the plain precept of so great an apostle, especially considering the reason by which he backeth his precept. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But to the rest speak I, not the Lord,.... He had spoken before to married persons in general, and had delivered not his own sentiments barely, but the commandment of the Lord, that such should never separate from, or put away each other; in which he has respect to such as were upon equal foot in matters of religion, who were both of them believers in Christ; but now he speaks to the rest, to such as were unequally yoked, the one a believer, the other an unbeliever; and what he delivers on this head, concerning their living together, there being no express determination of this matter by the Lord himself, he under divine inspiration gives his sense of it; as that such marriages were valid, and that such persons ought to live together, and not separate on account of difference in religion: or the sense is, that as "to the rest" of the things they had wrote to him about, besides what he had given answer to already, he should speak to under divine illumination; though he had not an express law of Christ to point unto them, as the rule of their conduct: and particularly, whereas they had desired his judgment and advice upon this head, whether one who before conversion had married an unbeliever, ought to live with such an one, or whether it would not be advisable to leave, or put such away, to it he answers, <p>if any brother hath a wife that believeth not; that is, if any man who is now a brother, one called by the grace of God, and is in church fellowship, has a wife to whom he was married whilst in a state of unregeneracy and infidelity; who is as she was when he married her, entirely destitute of faith in Christ; not one that is weak in the faith, or only makes an outward profession, but that has no faith at all in Christ, nor in his Gospel, not so much as an historical one; who disbelieves, denies, and rejects, the truths of the Gospel: <p>and she be pleased to dwell with him; loves her husband, chooses to continue with him, notwithstanding their different sentiments of religion: <p>let him not put her away; infidelity is no reason for a divorce. The Gospel revelation does not dissolve the natural obligations men and women are in to one another. The Jews had a law prohibiting marriages with Heathens and idolaters; and such marriages were dissolved, and such wives put away, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-16.htm">Exodus 34:16</a> but this was a law peculiar to that people, and was not obligatory on other nations, and especially has no place under the Gospel dispensation. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</span><p>(8) Eighthly, he affirms that those marriages which are already contracted between a faithful and an unfaithful or infidel, are firm: so that the faithful may not forsake the unfaithful.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/7.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-12.htm" title="But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother has a wife that believes not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.">1 Corinthians 7:12</a>.
