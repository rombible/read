St. Paul gives a reason why those who wrote to him should marry, and the force of the argument does not extend beyond the immediate object in view. St. Paul’s view of the higher aspects of matrimony are fully set forth when he treats of that subject generally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm" title="For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy: for I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ.">2Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-4.htm" title="Why, my brothers, you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ; that you should be married to another, even to him who is raised from the dead, that we should bring forth fruit to God.">Romans 7:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25-32</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-9 The apostle tells the Corinthians that it was good, in that juncture of time, for Christians to keep themselves single. Yet he says that marriage, and the comforts of that state, are settled by Divine wisdom. Though none may break the law of God, yet that perfect rule leaves men at liberty to serve him in the way most suited to their powers and circumstances, of which others often are very unfit judges. All must determine for themselves, seeking counsel from God how they ought to act.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless - But (&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#768;  de). Though this is to be admitted as proper where it can be done, when a man has entire control of himself and his passions, and though in present circumstances it would be expedient, yet it may be proper also to enter into the marriage connection.<p>To avoid fornication - Greek On account of &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;  dia fornication. The word fornication is used here in the large sense of licentiousness in general. For the sake of the purity of society, and to avoid the evils of sensual indulgence, and the corruptions and crimes which attend an illicit contact, it is proper that the married state should be entered. To this vice they were particularly exposed in Corinth. See the introduction. Paul would keep the church from scandal. How much evil, how much deep pollution, how many abominable crimes would have been avoided, which have since grown out of the monastic system, and the celibacy of the clergy among the papists, if Paul's advice had been followed by all professed Christians! Paul says that marriage is honorable, and that the relations of domestic life should be formed to avoid the evils which would otherwise result. The world is the witness of the evils which flow from the neglect of his advice. Every community where the marriage tie has been lax and feeble, or where it has been disregarded or dishonored, has been full of pollution, and it will always be. Society is pure and virtuous, just as marriage is deemed honorable, and as its vows are adhered to and preserved.<p>Let every man ... - Let the marriage vow be honored by all.<p>Have his own wife - And one wife to whom he shall be faithful. Polygamy is unlawful under the gospel; and divorce is unlawful. Let every man and woman, therefore, honor the institution of God, and avoid the evils of illicit indulgence. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Here the general rule is given<p>to avoid fornication&#8212;More literally, "on account of fornications," to which as being very prevalent at Corinth, and not even counted sins among the heathen, unmarried persons might be tempted. The plural, "fornications," marks irregular lusts, as contrasted with the unity of the marriage relation [Bengel].<p>let every man have&#8212;a positive command to all who have not the gift of continency, in fact to the great majority of the world (1Co 7:5). The dignity of marriage is set forth by Paul (Eph 5:25-32), in the fact that it signifies the mystical union between Christ and the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Nevertheless, to avoid fornication; </span> in the Greek it is, Because of fornications; the sense of which can be no other than this which our translators give. The word is in the plural number, to signify that that which he meaneth by this term, is all sorts of impurities and uncleannesses, which are the products of the lusts of the flesh. These are sins of that nature and species, that if we cannot choose what in respect of some circumstances would be more convenient, we must balk it, rather than run into such a guilt. The apostle doth therefore determine, that in this case it was every man’s duty to marry, and every woman’s likewise; the reason of which must be, because God had ordained marriage as a means to bridle men, and restrain them from extravagant lusts. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">His own wife, her own husband; </span> a clear place against polygamy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication,....

It is opposed, further, by the consideration that <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὰς πορνείας</span> is a determining element of a <span class="ital">moral</span> kind, which must therefore necessarily lead not to a mere permissibility, but to a positive obligation (already noted by Erasmus). This injunction, however, is a moral rule, to which exceptions may occur from higher considerations in cases where no danger of fornication is apprehended and there is the “donum continentiae,” as Paul himself had shown by his own example,—in which, nevertheless, no support whatever is given to any sort of celibacy <span class="ital">enforced by law</span>, a thing which, on the contrary, our text decidedly discountenances. Rückert thinks further that Paul exhibits here a very poor opinion of marriage; and Baur (in the <span class="ital">theol. Jahrb.</span> 1852, p. 15 ff.) has more fully developed this idea so as to assert that the apostle’s view of marriage is at variance with the moral conception of it which now prevails.[1068] Comp also Rothe, <span class="ital">Ethik</span>, III. p. 614. But can it be true, then, that <span class="ital">he</span>, who looked upon the union with Christ itself as the analogue of wedded life, valued marriage only as a “temperamentum continentiae”? No! what he does is this: out of all the different grounds on which marriage rested in his mind, he selects just that one which, in the first place, specially concerned his readers (remember the <span class="greekheb">κορινθιάζεσθαι</span>), and in the second place, had peculiar weight in connection with the nearness of the Parousia. That approaching catastrophe might furnish him with sufficient reasons for leaving unmentioned those higher ends of marriage which reached forth into a more remote future, and confining himself to the immediate practical relations of the brief, momentous present. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-26.htm" title="I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, I say, that it is good for a man so to be.">1 Corinthians 7:26</a> ff. Keeping in view the present <span class="greekheb">ἀνάγκη</span>, the near approach of the Lord, and the necessity, therefore, of an undivided surrender to Him, Paul had, <span class="ital">under these given circumstances</span>, recognised in the state of single life what in and by itself was <span class="greekheb">καλὸν ἀνθρώπῳ</span>, <span class="ital">if only no fornication and heat were conjoined therewith</span>.

In this single word St. Paul practically refutes all the dangerous and unwarrantable inferences drawn by St. Jerome and others from the previous clause. St. Jerome argues: "If it is good for a man not to touch a woman, it must be bad to do so, and therefore celibacy is a holier state than marriage." He also says, "I suspect the goodness of a thing which the greatness of another evil enforces as a lesser evil." Such reasoning shows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> The danger of pressing words to the full extent of the logical inferences which may be deduced from them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> The errors which always arise from arguing upon isolated texts dissevered from their context, and from all consideration of the circumstances under which they were written. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> The necessity of following the guidance of the Holy Spirit when he shows, by history and experience, the need for altering precepts with reference to altered conditions. There is in celibacy a moral beauty - it is <span class="accented">kalon</span>; there are cases in which it becomes a duty. But in most cases marriage, being no less a duty, as St. Paul proceeds to show, is even fairer and more excellent. Neither state, the wedded or the unwedded, is in itself more holy than the other. Each has its own honour and loveliness, and can only be judged of in connection with surrounding circumstances. Those who make St. Paul judge slightingly of marriage contradict his own express rules and statements (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-24.htm">Ephesians 5:24, 31, 32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>), and make him speak the current heathen language of heathen epicures, who, to the great injury of morals, treated marriage as a disagreeable necessity, which was, if possible, to be avoided. If the "it is a good thing" of St. Paul in ver. 1 were to be taken absolutely, it would have to be corrected <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> by the example of Christ, who beautified with his presence the marriage at Cana (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-1.htm">John 2:1, 2</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> by the primeval law which said, "It is not good for man to be alone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-18.htm">Genesis 2:18</a>); and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> by the fact that marriage is the chosen analogue of the relation between Christ and his Church. But the very phrase he uses, as will be seen by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-15.htm">1 Corinthians 9:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm">Matthew 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-21.htm">Romans 14:21</a>, etc., is a <span class="accented">relative</span> not an <span class="accented">absolute</span> one, and St. Paul uses it here concessively, but with the object of pointing out limitations which almost reversed it. To avoid <span class="cmt_word">fornication</span>; rather, <span class="accented">because o f fornication</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> because of the many forms of impurity which were current every where, but especially at Corinth. Some have argued that St. Paul takes a "low" and "poor" view of marriage by regarding it only in the light of a remedy against fornication. The answer is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">1.</span> That the reason which he assigns is a true reason in itself, and with reference to the masses of mankind; for which reason it is adopted by our Church in her Marriage Service. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">2.</span> He is addressing those who were living in a corrupt and semi-heathen atmosphere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="Text_Heading">3.</span> He is not here speaking of the idealized and spiritual aspect of marriage, but only of large practical necessities. When he speaks of marriage as a high Christian mystery (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-2.htm">2 Corinthians 11:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-22.htm">Ephesians 5:22-33</a>), he adopts a very different tone. <span class="cmt_word">Let</span> <span class="cmt_word">every man have.</span> A rule, not a mere permission. He here implies the truth that married love bears no analogy whatever to the <span class="accented">vagae libidines</span> of those who live like "natural brute beasts." In marriage the sensuous impulse, by being controlled and placed under religious sanctions is refined and purified from a degradation into a sacrament. Instead of being any longer the source of untold curses to mankind, it becomes the condition of their continuance and an element in their peace, because it is then placed under the blessing of God and of his Church. </body></html>
