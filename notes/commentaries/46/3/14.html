Those who have built well shall have their reward in their work having survived the trial of the fire; those who have built otherwise shall lose everything—their work, which should have remained as their reward, will perish in the fire—and they themselves will be as men who only make good their escape by rushing through a conflagration, leaving all that was theirs to be destroyed.

Let it not be supposed by any that the apostle is here putting a case that never occurs, or can occur: such cases, there is reason to believe, have often occurred, and still do and will occur; in which ministers, who are themselves real partakers of the grace of Christ, and truly pious, yet, through error of judgment, attachment to certain opinions, or a particular party, or under the influence of peculiar prejudices, waste their time, and that of their hearers, in building wood, hay, and stubble, when they should be labouring to raise an edifice of <span class="ital">gold, silver, </span>and <span class="ital">precious stones; </span>employ themselves in inculcating unessential or unimportant, if not even false doctrines, when they ought to be testifying with sincerity, zeal, and diligence, the genuine gospel of the grace of God. Dr. Macknight, who considers the apostle as speaking in these verses, not of the foundation and superstructure of a system of doctrines, “but of the building or temple of God, consisting of all who profess to believe the gospel,” gives us the following commentary on the passage: <span class="ital">“Other foundation </span>of God’s temple, <span class="ital">no teacher, </span>if he teaches faithfully, <span class="ital">can lay, except what is laid </span>by me, <span class="ital">which is Jesus, the Christ, </span>promised in the Scriptures. <span class="ital">Now if any teacher build on the foundation, </span>Christ, sincere disciples, represented in this similitude by <span class="ital">gold, silver, valuable stones; </span>or if he buildeth hypocrites, represented by <span class="ital">wood, hay, stubble, every teacher’s disciples shall be made manifest </span>in their true characters; <span class="ital">for the day </span>of persecution, which is coming on them, will make every one’s character plain, because it is of such a nature as to be revealed by the fire of persecution: <span class="ital">and so that fire, </span>falling on the temple of God, <span class="ital">will try every teacher’s disciples, of what sort they are. If the disciples, which any teacher has introduced into the church, endure persecution </span>for the gospel without apostatizing, <span class="ital">such a teacher shall </span>receive the reward promised to them who turn others to righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-3.htm" title="And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever.">Daniel 12:3</a>. <span class="ital">If the disciples of any teacher shall, </span>in time of persecution, <span class="ital">fall away, </span>through the want of proper instruction, <span class="ital">he will lose his reward; </span>he <span class="ital">himself, however, </span>having in general acted sincerely, <span class="ital">shall be saved; yet, </span>with such difficulty, <span class="ital">as </span>one is saved who runs through a fire.” But, as by the <span class="ital">foundation, </span>which he says he had laid, the apostle undoubtedly meant the doctrine concerning Christ, and salvation through him, it seems more consistent with his design to interpret what refers to the superstructure attempted to be raised by different builders, of doctrines also, and not of persons introduced by them into the Christian Church: and to understand him as cautioning the Corinthians against disfiguring and destroying the beautiful edifice, by inculcating tenets which were heretical, and pernicious to the souls of men, and would not stand the test of the approaching fiery trial. Thus what follows.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:10-15 The apostle was a wise master-builder; but the grace of God made him such. Spiritual pride is abominable; it is using the greatest favours of God, to feed our own vanity, and make idols of ourselves. But let every man take heed; there may be bad building on a good foundation. Nothing must be laid upon it, but what the foundation will bear, and what is of a piece with it. Let us not dare to join a merely human or a carnal life with a Divine faith, the corruption of sin with the profession of Christianity. Christ is a firm, abiding, and immovable Rock of ages, every way able to bear all the weight that God himself or the sinner can lay upon him; neither is there salvation in any other. Leave out the doctrine of his atonement, and there is no foundation for our hopes. But of those who rest on this foundation, there are two sorts. Some hold nothing but the truth as it is in Jesus, and preach nothing else. Others build on the good foundation what will not abide the test, when the day of trail comes. We may be mistaken in ourselves and others; but there is a day coming that will show our actions in the true light, without covering or disguise. Those who spread true and pure religion in all its branches, and whose work will abide in the great day, shall receive a reward. And how great! how much exceeding their deserts! There are others, whose corrupt opinions and doctrines, or vain inventions and usages in the worship of God, shall be made known, disowned, and rejected, in that day. This is plainly meant of a figurative fire, not of a real one; for what real fire can consume religious rites or doctrines? And it is to try every man's works, those of Paul and Apollos, as well as others. Let us consider the tendency of our undertakings, compare them with God's word, and judge ourselves, that we be not judged of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any man's work abide ... - If it shall appear that he hast taught the true doctrines of Christianity, and inculcated right practices and views of piety, and himself cherished right feelings: if the trial of the great Day, when the real qualities of all objects shall be known, shall show this.<p>He shall receive a reward - According to the nature of his work.

See also Valckenaer, <span class="ital">a</span>[536]<span class="ital"> Herod.</span> vii. 39. The thought is: He will, as a punishment, not receive the recompense which he would otherwise have received as a teacher. We are not to think of <span class="ital">deposition from office</span> (Grotius), seeing that it is the time of the Parousia that is spoken of. To take the <span class="greekheb">ζημ</span>., with the Vulgate, <span class="ital">et al</span>[537]<span class="ital">: without</span> object, so that the sense would be: “<span class="ital">he shall have loss from it</span>” (Hofmann), gives too indefinite a conception, and one which would require first of all to have its meaning defined more precisely from the antithesis of <span class="greekheb">μισθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λήψεται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς δὲ σωθήσεται</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὕτω δὲ ὡς διὰ πυρός</span>] In order not to be misunderstood, as if by his <span class="greekheb">ζημιωθήσεται</span> he were denying to such teachers share in the future Messianic salvation at all, whereas he is only refusing to assign to them the higher rank of blessedness, blessedness as teachers, Paul adds: <span class="ital">Yet he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire</span>. <span class="greekheb">Αὐτός</span> refers to the <span class="greekheb">τὸν μισθόν</span>, which is to be supplied as the object of <span class="greekheb">ζημ</span>.: although he will lose his <span class="ital">recompense</span>, yet <span class="ital">he himself</span>, etc. Rückert is wrong in thinking that the builder is now regarded as the <span class="ital">inhabitant</span> of the house. Paul does not handle his figure in this confused way, but has before his mind the builder as still busied in the house with the work which he has been carrying on: all at once the fire seizes the house; he flees and yet finds safety, but not otherwise than as a man is saved through and from the midst of fire. Such an escape is wont to be coupled with <span class="ital">fear and painful injury</span>; hence the <span class="ital">idea</span> of this figurative representation is: <span class="ital">He himself, however, shall obtain the Messianic</span> <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>,[538] <span class="ital">yet still only in such a way that the catastrophe of the Parousia will be fraught with the highest anxiety for him, and will not elapse without sensibly impairing his inheritance of blessing</span>. He shall obtain the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>, but only a lower grade of it, so that he will belong to those whom Jesus calls “<span class="ital">the last</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm" title="So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.">Matthew 20:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-31.htm" title="But many that are first shall be last; and the last first.">Mark 10:31</a>). The main point in this interpretation, namely, that <span class="greekheb">σωθήσ</span>. refers to the Messianic <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span>, is accepted by most expositors; but several, such as Rosenmüller and Flatt, take the future as indicating the <span class="ital">possibility</span> (a view which the very fact of the two preceding futures should have sufficed to preclude), and Grotius[539] has foisted in a <span class="ital">problematical</span> sense into the word (equally against the definitely assertive sense of those futures): “In summo erit salutis suae periculo. Etsi eam adipiscetur (quod boni ominis causa sperare mavult apostolus) non fiet id sine gravi moestitia ac dolore.” It is a common mistake to understand <span class="greekheb">ὡς διὰ πυρός</span> in the sense of a <span class="ital">proverb</span> (<span class="ital">by a hair’s-breadth</span>, see Grotius and Wetstein <span class="ital">in loc</span>[540]; Valckenaer, p. 157; and comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-11.htm" title="I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-2.htm" title="And the LORD said to Satan, The LORD rebuke you, O Satan; even the LORD that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you: is not this a brand plucked out of the fire?">Zechariah 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-23.htm" title="And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name of the city before was Luz.)">Judges 1:23</a>), because the passage, looking back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, really <span class="ital">sets before us a conflagration</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὡς</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>). It may be added that there is no ground for bringing into the conception the fire <span class="ital">of the wrath of God</span> (Hofmann), since, according to the text, it is the <span class="ital">selfsame</span> fire which seizes upon the work <span class="ital">of the one and of the other</span>, in the one case, however, proving it to be abiding, and in the other consuming it. Bengel illustrates the matter well by the instance of a shipwrecked man: “ut mercator naufragus amissa merce et lucro servatur <span class="ital">per undas</span>.” Other commentators, again (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact), understand it to mean: <span class="ital">He shall be preserved, but so only as one is preserved through the fire of hell</span>, that is to say, eternally tormented therein. So too of late, in substance, Maier. But the interpretation is decidedly erroneous; first, because, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-13.htm" title="Every man's work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is.">1 Corinthians 3:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">πῦρ</span> cannot be allowed to have any reference to the fire of hell; secondly, because <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΏΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, which is the standing expression for being saved with the salvation of the Messiah, can least of all be used to denote anything else in a picture representing the decision of the Parousia.[542] This last consideration tells also against Schott’s explanation (<span class="ital">l.c</span>[543] p. 17): “<span class="ital">He himself shall indeed not be utterly destroyed on that account; he remains, but it is as one who has passed through flaming fire</span> (<span class="ital">seriously injured</span>),” by which is denoted the divine award of punishment which awaits such a teacher at the day of judgment. It may also be urged against the view in question, that the sentence of punishment, since it <span class="ital">dooms to the fire</span>, cannot be depicted in the figure as a <span class="ital">having passed through</span> the fire.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[534] <span class="ital">c.</span> <span class="ital">scilicet</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[536] <span class="ital">d</span> refers to the note of the commentator or editor named on the particular passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[537] <span class="ital">t al.</span> and others; and other passages; and other editions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[538] For he has after all held to the foundation. The Messianic salvation is the <span class="ital">gift of grace</span> to those who believe in Christ as such; while the teacher’s blessedness, as <span class="greekheb">μισθός</span> (which the general <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> in and by itself is <span class="ital">not</span>), must be some specially high grade of blessing in the Messiah’s kingdom.
