Men may have much doctrinal knowledge, yet be mere beginners in the life of faith and experience. Contentions and quarrels about religion are sad evidences of carnality. True religion makes men peaceable, not contentious. But it is to be lamented, that many who should walk as Christians, live and act too much like other men. Many professors, and preachers also, show themselves to be yet carnal, by vain-glorious strife, eagerness for dispute, and readiness to despise and speak evil of others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For ye are yet carnal - Though you are Christians, and are the friends of God in the main, yet your divisions and strifes show that you are yet, in some degree, under the influence of the principles which govern the people of this world.

The envy here referred to, was that which arose from the superior advantages and endowments which some claimed or possessed over others. Envy everywhere is a fruitful cause of strife. Most contentions in the church are somehow usually connected with envy.<p>And strife - Contention and dispute.<p>And divisions - Dissensions and quarrels. The margin correctly renders it "factions." The idea is, that they were split up into parties, and that those parties were embittered with mutual recriminations and reproaches, as they always are in a church.<p>And walk as men - Margin. "according to man." The word "walk" is used often in the Scriptures in the sense of "conduct" or "act." You conduct yourselves as human beings of this earth, that is, as people commonly do; you evince the same spirit that the great mass of mankind does. Instead of being filled with love; of being united and harmonious as the members of the same family ought to be, you are split up into factions as the people of the world are. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. envying&#8212;jealousy, rivalry. As this refers to their feelings, "strife" refers to their words, and "divisions" to their actions [Bengel]. There is a gradation, or ascending climax: envying had produced strife, and strife divisions (factious parties) [Grotius].

The Syriac reads it, , "ye are in the flesh": a phrase the apostle elsewhere uses of men in an unregenerate state; but this is not his meaning here, as before explained, but that carnality still prevailed among them, of which he gives proof and evidence: <p>for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? They envied each other's gifts and knowledge, strove about words to no profit, entered into warm debates and contentions about their ministers, and went into factions and parties, which were distinguished by the names they were most affected to; in all which they gave too clear evidence of their prevailing carnality, that they too much walked as other men, who make no profession of religion; that they were led by the judgment of men, and were carried away with human passions and inflections; and in their conduct could scarcely be distinguished from the rest of the world.

GOD’S RIGHTS IN THE CHURCH. One idea runs through this chapter and into the next,—that of <span class="ital">God’s</span> Church, <span class="ital">God’s</span> temple at Corinth, in whose construction so many various builders are engaged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?...">1 Corinthians 3:5-17</a>). For this building’s sake, and because it is His, God beats down the pride of human craft, making all things, persons, times, serve His people, while they serve Christ, as Christ serves God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise....">1 Corinthians 3:18-23</a>). To God His servants are responsible; it is His to judge and commend them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/4-1.htm" title="Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God....">1 Corinthians 4:1-5</a>). Thus the thought that the Gospel is “God’s power, God’s wisdom,” pursued since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-18.htm" title="For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us which are saved it is the power of God.">1 Corinthians 1:18</a>, is brought to bear upon the situation in Corinth. God who sends the message of the cross, admitting in its communication no mixture of human wisdom (ch. 1), chose and inspired His own instruments for its importation (ch. 2).

The latter, as we have seen, signifies the man whose hopes and desires are bounded by the limits of the physical principle of life. The former is applicable to those who are under the dominion of their sensual passions. He inculcates a truth which may seem strange to our ears when he tells his Corinthian converts that a taste for religious controversy is a sign of the strength of the animal nature in man. His language is less remarkable though not less true, when he reminds us (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-2.htm" title="I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for till now you were not able to bear it, neither yet now are you able.">1 Corinthians 3:2</a></span>) that an appetite for religious strife prevents us from discerning the deeper truths of the Christian faith. If it be asked how ‘they who are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints’ can at the same time be carnal, we may answer, with Olshausen, that the spiritual man becomes carnal when he mingles his old unregenerate views with the new element of life he has received in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">as men</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">after the manner of men</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅπου</span>) <span class="ital">where</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ζῆλος</span>, <span class="ital">envying</span>) This refers to the state of feeling.—<span class="greekheb">ἔρις</span>, <span class="ital">strife</span>) to the words.—<span class="greekheb">διχοστασίαι</span>, <span class="ital">divisions</span>) to the actions.
