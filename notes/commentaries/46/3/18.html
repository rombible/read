The wisdom that wordly men esteem, is foolishness with God. How justly does he despise, and how easily can he baffle and confound it! The thoughts of the wisest men in the world, have vanity, weakness, and folly in them. All this should teach us to be humble, and make us willing to be taught of God, so as not to be led away, by pretences to human wisdom and skill, from the simple truths revealed by Christ. Mankind are very apt to oppose the design of the mercies of God. Observe the spiritual riches of a true believer; All are yours, even ministers and ordinances. Nay, the world itself is yours. Saints have as much of it as Infinite Wisdom sees fit for them, and they have it with the Divine blessing. Life is yours, that you may have a season and opportunity to prepare for the life of heaven; and death is yours, that you may go to the possession of it. It is the kind messenger to take you from sin and sorrow, and to guide you to your Father's house. Things present are yours, for your support on the road; things to come are yours, to delight you for ever at your journey's end. If we belong to Christ, and are true to him, all good belongs to us, and is sure to us. Believers are the subjects of his kingdom. He is Lord over us, we must own his dominion, and cheerfully submit to his command. God in Christ, reconciling a sinful world to himself, and pouring the riches of his grace on a reconciled world, is the sum and substance of the gospel.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man deceive himself - The apostle here proceeds to make a practical application of the truths which he had stated, and to urge on them humility, and to endeavor to repress the broils and contentions into which they had fallen. Let no man be puffed up with a vain conceit of his own wisdom, for this had been the real cause of all the evils which they had experienced. Grotius renders this, "See that you do not attribute too much to your wisdom and learning, by resting on it, and thus deceive your own selves." "All human philosophy," says Grotius, "that is repugnant to the gospel is but vain deceit" - Probably there were many among them who would despise this admonition as coming from Paul, but he exhorts them to take care that they did not deceive themselves. We are taught here:<p>(1) The danger of self-deception - a danger that besets all on the subject of religion.<p>(2) the fact that false philosophy is the most fruitful source of self-deception in the business of religion. So it was among the Corinthians; and so it has been in all ages since.<p>If any man among you - Any teacher, whatever may be his rank or his confidence in his own abilities; or any private member of the church.<p>Seemeth to be wise - Seems to himself; or is thought to be, has the credit, or reputation of being wise. The word "seems" &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;  dokei implies this idea - if anyone seems, or is supposed to be a man of wisdom; if this is his reputation; and if he seeks that this should be his reputation among people. See instances of this construction in Bloomfield.<p>In this world - In this "age," or "world" (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#837; &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;  en to&#772; aio&#772;n touto&#772;). There is considerable variety in the interpretation of this passage among critics. It may be taken either with the preceding or the following words. Origen, Cyprian, Beza, Grotius, Hammond, and Locke adopt the latter method, and understand it thus: "If any man among you thinks himself to be wise, let him not hesitate to be a fool in the opinion of this age in order that he may be truly wise" - But the interpretation conveyed in our translation, is probably the correct one. "If any man has the reputation of wisdom among the people of this generation, and prides himself on it," etc. If he is esteemed wise in the sense in which the people of this world are, as a philosopher, a man of science, learning, etc.<p>Let him become a fool - <p>(1) Let him be willing to be regarded as a fool.<p>(2) let him sincerely embrace this gospel, which will inevitably expose him to the charge of being a fool.<p>(3) let all his earthly wisdom be esteemed in his own eyes as valueless and as folly in the great matters of salvation.<p>That he may be wise - That he may have true wisdom - that which is of God. It is implied here:<p>(1) That the wisdom of this world will not make a man truly wise.<p>(2) that a "reputation" for wisdom may contribute nothing to a man's true wisdom, but may stand in the way of it.<p>(3) that for such a man to embrace the gospel it is necessary that he should be willing to cast away dependence on his own wisdom, and come with the temper of a child to the Saviour.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. seemeth&#8212;that is, is, and is regarded by himself and others.<p>wise in this world&#8212;wise in mere worldly wisdom (1Co 1:20).<p>let him become a fool&#8212;by receiving the Gospel in its unworldly simplicity, and so becoming a fool in the world's sight [Alford].
