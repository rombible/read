In the closing verses of 1 Corinthians 2 St. Paul has enunciated the general method of teaching spiritual truth as being dependent upon the receptive powers of those who are being taught. He now proceeds to point out to them that their own character, as being wanting in spirituality, was the real hindrance to his teaching them the higher spiritual truth which may be called “the wisdom” of the gospel.<p><span class= "bld">As unto carnal.</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">as being carnal.</span> Our version may seem to imply that the Apostle spoke to them <span class= "ital">as if</span> they were carnal, though they really were not so; but the force of the passage is that they were indeed carnal, and that the Apostle taught them not as if they were such, but as being such. “Carnal” is here the opposite of “spiritual,” and does not involve any reference to what we would commonly speak of as carnal sin.<p><span class= "bld">Babes in Christ.</span>—This is the opposite of the “full grown” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1Corinthians 2:6</a>, to whom the “wisdom” could be taught.

Men may have much doctrinal knowledge, yet be mere beginners in the life of faith and experience. Contentions and quarrels about religion are sad evidences of carnality. True religion makes men peaceable, not contentious. But it is to be lamented, that many who should walk as Christians, live and act too much like other men. Many professors, and preachers also, show themselves to be yet carnal, by vain-glorious strife, eagerness for dispute, and readiness to despise and speak evil of others.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I, brethren - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-1.htm">1 Corinthians 2:1</a>. This is designed to meet an implied objection. He had said <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14-16</a> that Christians were able to understand all things. Yet, they would recollect that he had not addressed them as such, but had confined himself to the more elementary parts of religion when he came among them. He had not entered upon the abstruse and difficult points of theology - the points of speculation in which the subtle Greeks so much abounded and so much delighted. He now states the reason why he had not done it. The reason was one that was most humbling to their pride; but it was the true reason, and faithfulness demanded that it should be stated. It was, that they were carnal, and not qualified to understand the deep mysteries of the gospel; and the proof of this was unhappily at hand. It was too evident in their contentions and strifes, that they were under the influence of carnal feelings and views.<p>Could not speak unto you as unto spiritual - "I could not regard you as spiritual - as qualified to enter into the full and higher truths of the gospel; I could not regard you as divested of the feelings which influence carnal people - the people of the world, and I addressed you accordingly. I could not discourse to you as to far-advanced and well-informed Christians. I taught you the rudiments only of the Christian religion." He refers here, doubtless, to his instructions when he founded the church at Corinth. See the note at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-13.htm">1 Corinthians 2:13-15</a>.<p>But as unto carnal - The word "carnal" here &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2;  sarkinois is not the same which in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>, is translated "natural" &#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  psuchikos. "That" refers to one who is unrenewed, and who is wholly under the influence of his sensual or animal nature, and is no where applied to Christians. "This" is applied here to Christians - but to those who have much of the remains of corruption, and who are imperfectly acquainted with the nature of religion; babes in Christ. It denotes those who still evinced the feelings and views which pertain to the flesh, in these unhappy contentions, and strifes, and divisions. "The works of the flesh are hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, envyings" <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/5-20.htm">Galatians 5:20-21</a>; and these they had evinced in their divisions; and Paul knew that their danger lay in this direction, and he therefore addressed them according to their character. Paul applies the word to himself <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/7-14.htm">Romans 7:14</a>, "for I am carnal;" and here it denotes that they were as yet under the influence of the corrupt passions and desires which the flesh produces.<p>As unto babes in Christ - As unto those recently born into his kingdom, and unable to understand the profounder doctrines of the Christian religion. It is a common figure to apply the term infants and children to those who are feeble in understanding, or unable, from any cause, to comprehend the more profound instructions of science or religion. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>1Co 3:1-23. Paul Could Not Speak to Them of Deep Spiritual Truths, as They Were Carnal, Contending for Their Several Teachers; These Are Nothing but Workers for God, to Whom They Must Give Account in the Day of Fiery Judgment. The Hearers Are God's Temple, Which They Must Not Defile by Contentions for Teachers, Who, as Well as All Things, Are Theirs, Being Christ's.<p>1. And I&#8212;that is, as the natural (animal) man cannot receive, so I also could not speak unto you the deep things of God, as I would to the spiritual; but I was compelled to speak to you as I would to MEN OF FLESH. The oldest manuscripts read this for "carnal." The former (literally, "fleshy") implies men wholly of flesh, or natural. Carnal, or fleshly, implies not they were wholly natural or unregenerate (1Co 2:14), but that they had much of a carnal tendency; for example their divisions. Paul had to speak to them as he would to men wholly natural, inasmuch as they are still carnal (1Co 3:3) in many respects, notwithstanding their conversion (1Co 1:4-9).<p>babes&#8212;contrasted with the perfect (fully matured) in Christ (Col 1:28; compare Heb 5:13, 14). This implies they were not men wholly of flesh, though carnal in tendencies. They had life in Christ, but it was weak. He blames them for being still in a degree (not altogether, compare 1Co 1:5, 7; therefore he says as) babes in Christ, when by this time they ought to have "come unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ" (Eph 4:13). In Ro 7:14, also the oldest manuscripts read, "I am a man of flesh."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_corinthians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div><span class="bld">1 CORINTHIANS 3</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:1</a>,2</span> Paul showeth that he could not instruct the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Corinthians in the higher doctrines of Christianity<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>because of their carnal mind,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm" title="For you are yet carnal: for whereas there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not carnal, and walk as men?">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>,4</span> which temper discovered itself in their factions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-5.htm" title="Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom you believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?...">1 Corinthians 3:5-9</a></span> The most eminent preachers of the gospel are but<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>instruments employed by God in building his church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-10.htm" title="According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise master builder, I have laid the foundation, and another builds thereon.

But the latter two phrases differ from each other, not in their real meaning, but only in the form of representation.—Holsten, too, z. <span class="ital">Ev. d. Paul. u.

The <span class="ital">expositors</span> commonly do <span class="ital">not</span> enter upon <span class="ital">any</span> distinction between <span class="greekheb">σάρκινος</span> and <span class="greekheb">σαρκικός</span>, <span class="ital">either</span> (so the majority) reading <span class="greekheb">σαρκικοῖς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.">1 Corinthians 3:1</a> also, <span class="ital">or</span> (Rückert, Pott) arbitrarily giving out that the two words are alike in meaning.

The phrase denotes those who, in their relation to Christ (in Christianity), are still children under age, <span class="ital">i.e. mere beginners</span>.

The <span class="greekheb">εὐαγγελίζεσθαι</span>, on the other hand, which leads on to baptism, is <span class="ital">preparatory</span>, giving rise to faith, and forming the medium through which their calling takes place; and accordingly it has <span class="ital">not</span> yet to do with <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι ἐν Χριστῷ</span>. The inference is a mistaken one, therefore (on the part of Rückert), that Paul has in mind here a <span class="ital">second</span> residence in Corinth not recorded in the Acts.

CHRIST’S SERVANTS ANSWERABLE TO HIMSELF. The Ap. has shown his readers their own true position—so high and yet so lowly (§ 11); Paul, Apollos, Cephas are but part of a universe of ministry that waits upon them. But more is to be said about the Christian <span class="ital">leaders</span>, whose names are sc much abused at Cor[629] If the Church is to understand its proper character, it must reverence theirs. They are its servants; it is not their master. They are its property, because they are <span class="ital">Christ’s</span> property; and His instruments first of all. P. thus resumes the train of thought opened in § 10, where the work of Church-builders was discriminated in relation to <span class="ital">the building</span>; now it is viewed in its relation to <span class="ital">God the Householder</span>. Here lies another and the final ground of accusation against the Cor[630] parties: those who maintained them, in applauding this chief and censuring that, were putting themselves into Christ’s judgment-seat, from which the Apostle thrusts them down.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[629] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[630] Corinth, Corinthian or Corinthians.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_corinthians/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/3-1.htm" title="And I, brothers, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ....">1 Corinthians 3:1-4</a>.
