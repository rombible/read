The word <span class="greekheb">κυβερνησεις</span>, is properly the steering of a ship with skill by a pilot; and seems to be put here metaphorically for persons directing or managing affairs with judgment. It does not appear, however, that these two last expressions were intended by the apostle to signify distinct offices. Rather any persons might be called <span class="ital">helps </span>or <span class="ital">helpers, </span>from a particular dexterity in helping the distressed; and <span class="ital">governors </span>or <span class="ital">governments, </span>from a peculiar talent for governing or presiding in assemblies. <span class="ital">Are all </span>the members or ministers of the church <span class="ital">apostles, </span>&c. — Seeing God has not given all sorts of gifts to one, but some to one, and others to another, that each one might stand in need of the others; therefore let none despise another, but all join together in employing their gifts for the common good of the church. <span class="ital">But</span> <span class="ital">covet earnestly the best gifts </span>— For they are well worth your desire and pursuit, though but few of you can attain them; <span class="ital">and yet I show you a more excellent way </span>— I point out unto you a more excellent gift than any or all of them, and one which all may, yea, must attain, or perish. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:27-31 Contempt, hatred, envy, and strife, are very unnatural in Christians. It is like the members of the same body being without concern for one another, or quarrelling with each other. The proud, contentious spirit that prevailed, as to spiritual gifts, was thus condemned. The offices and gifts, or favours, dispensed by the Holy Spirit, are noticed. Chief ministers; persons enabled to interpret Scripture; those who laboured in word and doctrine; those who had power to heal diseases; such as helped the sick and weak; such as disposed of the money given in charity by the church, and managed the affairs of the church; and such as could speak divers languages. What holds the last and lowest rank in this list, is the power to speak languages; how vain, if a man does so merely to amuse or to exalt himself! See the distribution of these gifts, not to every one alike, ver. 29,30. This were to make the church all one, as if the body were all ear, or all eye. The Spirit distributes to every one as he will. We must be content though we are lower and less than others. We must not despise others, if we have greater gifts. How blessed the Christian church, if all the members did their duty! Instead of coveting the highest stations, or the most splendid gifts, let us leave the appointment of his instruments to God, and those in whom he works by his providence. Remember, those will not be approved hereafter who seek the chief places, but those who are most faithful to the trust placed in them, and most diligent in their Master's work.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And God hath set - That is, has appointed, constituted, ordained. He has established these various orders or ranks in the church. The apostle, having illustrated the main idea that God had conferred various endowments on the members of the church, proceeds here to specify particularly what he meant, and to refer more directly to the various ranks which existed in the church.<p>Some in the church - The word "some," in this place &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  hous, seems to mean rather whom, "and whom God hath placed in the church," or, they whom God hath constituted in the church in the manner above mentioned are, first, apostles, etc.<p>First, apostles - In the first rank or order; or as superior in honor and in office. He has given them the highest authority in the church; he has more signally endowed them and qualified them than he has others.<p>Secondarily, prophets - As second in regard to endowments and importance. For the meaning of the word "prophets," see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>.<p>Thirdly, teachers - As occupying the third station in point of importance and valuable endowments. On the meaning of this word, and the nature of this office, see the note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-7.htm">Romans 12:7</a>.<p>After that, miracles - Power. (&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  dunameis). Those who had the power of working miracles; referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-10.htm">1 Corinthians 12:10</a>.<p>Then gifts of healing - The power of healing those who were sick; see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm">1 Corinthians 12:9</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-14.htm">James 5:14-15</a>.<p>Helps - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  antile&#772;mpseis). This word occurs no where else in the New Testament. It is derived from &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  antilambano&#772;, and denotes properly, "aid, assistance, help;" and then those who render aid, assistance, or help; helpers. Who they were is not known. They might have been those to whom was entrusted the care of the poor, and the sick, and strangers, widows, and orphans, etc.; that is, those who performed the office of deacons. Or they may have been those who attended on the apostles to aid them in their work, such as Paul refers to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. "Greet Priscilla, and Aquilla, my "helpers" in Christ Jesus;" and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm">1 Corinthians 12:9</a>," Salute Urbane our helper in Christ;" see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-3.htm">Romans 16:3</a>. It is not possible, perhaps, to determine the precise meaning of the word, or the nature of the office which they discharged; but the word means, in general, those who in any way aided or rendered assistance in the church, and may refer to the temporal affairs of the church, to the care of the poor, the distribution of charity and alms, or to the instruction of the ignorant, or to aid rendered directly to the apostles. There is no evidence that it refers to a distinct and "permanent" office in the church; but may refer to aid rendered by any class in any way. Probably many persons were profitably and usefully employed in various ways as aids in promoting the temporal or spiritual welfare of the church.<p>Governments - (&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  kuberne&#772;seis). This word is derived from &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c9;  kuberiao&#772;, "to govern;" and is usually applied to the government or "steering" of a ship. The word occurs no where else in the New Testament, though the word &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  kuberne&#772;te&#772;s ("governor") occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-11.htm">Acts 27:11</a>, rendered "master," and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/18-17.htm">Revelation 18:17</a>, rendered "shipmaster." It is not easy to determine what particular office or function is here intended. Doddridge, in accordance with Amyraut, supposes that distinct offices may not be here referred to, but that the same persons may be denoted in these expressions as being distinguished in various ways; that is, that the same persons were called helpers in reference to their skill in aiding those who were in distress, and governments in regard to their talent for doing business, and their ability in presiding in councils for deliberation, and in directing the affairs of the church.<p>There is no reason to think that the terms here used referred to permanent and established ranks and orders in the ministry and in the church; or in permanent offices which were to continue to all times as an essential part of its organization. It is certain that the "order" of "apostles" has ceased, and also the "order" of "miracles," and the order of "healings," and of "diversity of tongues." And it is certain that in the use of these terms of office, the apostle does not affirm that they would be permanent, and essential to the very existence of the church; and from the passage before us, therefore, it cannot be argued that there was to be an order of men in the church who were to be called "helps," or "governments." The truth probably was, that the circumstances of the primitive churches required the aid of many persons in various capacities which might not be needful or proper in other times and circumstances.<p>Whether, therefore, this is to be regarded as a permanent arrangement that there should be "governments" in the church, or an order of men entrusted with the sole office of governing, is to be learned not from this passage, but from other parts of the New Testament. Lightfoot contends that the word which is used here and translated "governments" does not refer to the power of ruling, but to a person endued with a deep and comprehensive mind, one who is wise and prudent; and in this view Mesheim, Macknight, and Horsley coincide. Calvin refers it to the elders to whom the exercise of discipline was entrusted. Grotius understands it of the pastors <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-1.htm">Ephesians 4:1</a>, or of the elders who presided over particular churches; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-8.htm">Romans 12:8</a>. Locke supposes that they were the same as those who had the power of discerning spirits. The simple idea, however, is that of ruling, or exercising government; but whether this refers to a permanent office, or to the fact that some were specially qualified by their wisdom and prudence, and in virtue of this usually regulated or directed the affairs of the church by giving counsel, etc., or whether they were "selected" and appointed for this purpose for a time; or whether it refers to the same persons who might also have exercised other functions, and this in addition, cannot be determined from the passage before us. All that is clear is, that there were those who administered government in the church. But the passage does not determine the form, or manner; nor does it prove - whatever may be true - that such an office was to be permanent in the church.<p>(There can be little doubt that the &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;  kuberne&#772;seis, or governments, refer to offices of rule and authority in the church. Two things, therefore, are plain from this text:<p>1. That in the primitive church there were rulers distinct from the people or church members, to whom these were bound to yield obedience.<p>2. That these rulers were appointed of God. "God set them in the church." As to the question of "permanence," on which our author thinks this passage affirms nothing: a distinction must be made between these offices which were obviously of an extraordinary kind, and which therefore must cease; and those of an ordinary kind, which are essential to the edification of the church in all ages. "The universal commission which the apostles received from their Master to make disciples of all nations, could not be permanent as to the extent of it, because it was their practice to ordain elders in every city, and because the course of human affairs required, that after Christianity was established, the teachers of it should officiate in particular places. The infallible guidance of the Spirit was not promised in the same measure to succeeding teachers. But being, in their case, vouched by the power of working miracles, it directed the Christians of their day, to submit implicitly to their injunctions and directions; and it warrants the Christian world, in all ages, to receive with entire confidence, that system of faith and morality which they were authorised to deliver in the name of Christ. But as all protestants hold that this system was completed when the canon of scripture was closed - it is admitted by them, that a great part of the apostolical powers ceased with those to whom Jesus first committed them.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. set &#8230; in the church&#8212;as He has "set the members &#8230; in the body" (1Co 12:18).<p>first apostles&#8212;above even the prophets.

The Americans similarly use "helps" for "helpers." And, as instances of the latter, presbyters, or bishops, whose office it was to govern the Church (1Ti 5:17; Heb 13:17, 24). These officers, though now ordinary and permanent, were originally specially endowed with the Spirit for their office, whence they are here classified with other functions of an inspired character. Government (literally, "guiding the helm" of affairs), as being occupied with external things, notwithstanding the outward status it gives, is ranked by the Spirit with the lower functions.

As before the apostle gives an account of the various different gifts of the Spirit, qualifying men for service in the church of Christ, here he enumerates the several offices and officers: <p>first apostles; as were the twelve disciples, and Paul the apostle; men that were immediately sent by Christ himself, and had their commission and doctrine directly from him; and a power of working miracles, to confirm the truth of their mission and ministry; they were sent into all the world to preach the Gospel, to plant churches everywhere, and to ordain officers in them; they were not confined to any particular church, but had power and authority in all the churches, to preach the word, administer ordinances, advise, counsel, direct, reprove, and censure: <p>secondarily, prophets; who either had the gift of foretelling things to come, as Agabus and others; or who had a peculiar gift, by divine revelation, of explaining the prophecies of the sacred writings, and of preaching the Gospel: <p>thirdly, teachers; the same with pastors, elders, and overseers; the ordinary ministers of the word, who have a gift of expounding the Scriptures; not by extraordinary revelation, but by the ordinary gift of the Spirit, in the use of means, as reading, meditation, and prayer; and whose work is to preach the word, administer ordinances, feed and govern particular churches, over whom they are set: after that miracles; which is to be understood, not of some persons, as distinct from apostles, prophets, and teachers, who also had the power of working miracles; but from persons and officers in the church, the principal of which the apostle had mentioned, he passes to things, which belonged at least to some of them; unless it can be thought that there were in those times private Christians, who were neither apostles nor prophets, nor teachers, and yet had a power of doing miracles: <p>then gifts of healing; the sick, by anointing them with oil, which was only one species of doing miracles; and which was sometimes performed, not only by apostles, and such like extraordinary persons, but by the common elders and ordinary officers of the church: <p>helps: meaning either the ministers of the word in common, who are helpers of the faith and joy of the saints, and are means of increasing their knowledge and spiritual experience, and of establishing them in the truth; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a> or else such evangelists and ministers of the word as were assistants to the apostles, such as Mark, and Timothy, and Titus; or rather the deacons of churches, whose business it is to take care of tables; the Lord's table, the minister's, and the poor's, and all the secular affairs of the church; and so are helps to the minister, relieve him, and free him from all worldly concerns, that he may the better attend to prayer, and the ministry of the word. These, whether one or the other, are so called, in allusion to the priests and Levites, who were  "helps", or assistants to the high priest, in the burning of the red heifer, and in other things (h): <p>governments; some by these understand the same with pastors and elders, who have the rule and government of the church; others lay elders, a sort of ruling elders in the church, as distinct from pastors. Dr. Lightfoot thinks such are intended, who had the gift of discerning spirits. I rather think with De Dieu, that the word designs counsellors; see the Septuagint in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-14.htm">Proverbs 11:14</a> and here intends such as are men of wisdom and prudence, who are very proper persons to be consulted and advised with, by the pastor, elder, or overseer, in matters of moment and importance in the church: <p>diversities of tongues; such as have the gift of speaking with divers tongues; or of interpreting them, or both.

The reading is disputed, but the sense seems to be that the crisis demands Polycarp as a pilot. Lightfoot says that this is the earliest example of a simile which was afterward used largely by christian writers - the comparison of the Church to a ship. Hippolytus represents the mast as the cross; the two rudders the two covenants; the undergirding ropes the love of Christ. The ship is one of the ornaments which Clement of Alexandria allows a Christian to wear ("Apostolic Fathers," Part II., Ignatius to Polycarp, 2). </body></html>
