Christians become members of this body by baptism. The outward rite is of Divine institution; it is a sign of the new birth, and is called therefore the washing of regeneration, Tit 3:5. But it is by the Spirit, only by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are made members of Christ's body. And by communion with Christ at the Lord's supper, we are strengthened, not by drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. Each member has its form, place, and use. The meanest makes a part of the body. There must be a distinction of members in the body. So Christ's members have different powers and different places. We should do the duties of our own place, and not murmur, or quarrel with others. All the members of the body are useful and necessary to each other. Nor is there a member of the body of Christ, but may and ought to be useful to fellow-members. As in the natural body of man, the members should be closely united by the strongest bonds of love; the good of the whole should be the object of all. All Christians are dependent one upon another; each is to expect and receive help from the rest. Let us then have more of the spirit of union in our religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For as the body is one - The general sentiment which the apostle had been illustrating and enforcing was, that all the endowments which were possessed in the church were the work of the same Holy Spirit, and that they ought to be appropriately cherished and prized, as being all useful and valuable in their places. This sentiment he now illustrates 1Co. 12:12-27 by a beautiful similitude taken from the mutual dependence of the various parts of the human body. The human body is one, and yet is composed of various members and parts that all unite harmoniously in one whole.<p>Being many - Or, although they are many; or while they are in some respects separate, and perform distinct and different functions, yet they all unite in one harmonious whole.<p>So also is Christ - The church is represented as the body of Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.htm">1 Corinthians 12:27</a>, meaning that it is one, and that he sustains to it the relation of Head; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22-23</a>. As the "head" is the most important part of the body, it may be put for the whole body; and the name "Christ" here, the head of the church, is put for the whole body of which he is the head; and means here the Christian society, or the church. This figure, of a part for the whole, is one that is common in all languages; see the note at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-4.htm">Romans 12:4-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Unity, not unvarying uniformity, is the law of God in the world of grace, as in that of nature. As the many members of the body compose an organic whole and none can be dispensed with as needless, so those variously gifted by the Spirit, compose a spiritual organic whole, the body of Christ, into which all are baptized by the one Spirit.<p>of that one body&#8212;Most of the oldest manuscripts omit "one."<p>so also is Christ&#8212;that is, the whole Christ, the head and body.

The members of the church may be many, and there may be in several members of the church a diversity of gifts, of administrations, and operations, yet the church is but one, yea, Christ and the church make up but one mystical body, of which he is the Head; and they are the members; and therefore the several members, having several gifts, or several offices, or several powers and operations, had no reason, for their difference in such gifts, or powers, or offices, to envy one another, or to despise each other, or glory over one another; for they were but one body, and had all the same Head, though they had from the same Spirit divers abilities, offices, and powers for several operations. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For as the body is one,.... That is, an human body; for of this the apostle speaks, and takes a simile, and forms a comparison from, showing the union among saints, and their mutual participation of the various gifts of the Spirit; for an human body is but one body, and not more. <p>And hath many members; as eyes, ears, hands, feet, &amp;c. <p>And all the members of that one body being many are one body; as numerous as they may be, they all belong to, and make up but one body; performing different offices, for which they are naturally fitted for the good of the whole: <p>so also to Christ; not personal, but mystical; not the head alone, or the members by themselves, but head and members as constituting one body, the church. The church, in union with Christ, the head, is but one general assembly, and church of the firstborn written in heaven, though consisting of the various persons of God's elect, who are closely united one to another, and their head Christ; and therefore are denominated from him, and called by his name; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-3.htm">Romans 9:3</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: <span class="cverse3">{8}</span> so also <i>is</i> <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> Christ.</span><p>(7) He sets forth his former saying by a similitude taken from the body: this, he says, is manifestly seen in the body, whose members are different, but yet so joined together, that they make but one body.<p>(8) The applying of the similitude. So must we also think, he says, of the mystical body of Christ: for all we who believe, whether we are Jews or Gentiles, are by one person by the same baptism, joined together with our head, that by that means, there may be framed one body compact of many members.

The manifold graces, ministries, workings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:4</a> ff.), that proceed from the action of the Holy Spirit in the Christian community, stand not only in common dependence upon Him (§ 39), but are mutually bound to each other. The Church of Christ is “the body” for the Spirit of God; and these operations are its correlated functional activities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1 Corinthians 12:12</a> f.). Differentiation is of the essence of bodily life. The unity of the Church is not that of inorganic nature,—a monotonous aggregation of similars, as in a pool of water or a heap of stones; it is the oneness of a living organism, no member of which exercises the same faculty as another.

Comparison of the Unity of the Body and the Unity of the Christian Church<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">For as the body is one, and hath many members</span>] This simile is a very common one. It is used on several occasions by the Apostle. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/12-4.htm" title="For as we have many members in one body, and all members have not the same office:...">Romans 12:4-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-16.htm" title="From whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies, according to the effectual working in the measure of every part, makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love.">Ephesians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-30.htm" title="For we are members of his body, of his flesh, and of his bones.">Ephesians 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>. It was even familiar to Gentile minds from the well-known apologue of Menenius Agrippa in Livy xi. 32. Cf. Shakespeare, <span class="ital">Coriolanus</span>, Act i. Sc. 1. For other examples see Alford <span class="ital">in loc</span>. The point here is somewhat different. The unity of the body in the fable above-mentioned centres in the idea of the body politic. In the Christian scheme the unity is found in Christ, of Whose life all His members partake.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">so also is Christ</span>] The Apostle, like Christ Himself in the parable of the Vine in St John 15 (as also in ch. 17), identifies His members with Himself. The life they live (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>) is no longer theirs but His. They have put on the new man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-24.htm" title="And that you put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness.">Ephesians 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-10.htm" title=" And have put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him:">Colossians 3:10</a>), the second Adam (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-45.htm" title="And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a quickening spirit.">1 Corinthians 15:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-47.htm" title="The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven.">1 Corinthians 15:47</a>) Who was created afresh in the Image of God.
