Christians become members of this body by baptism. The outward rite is of Divine institution; it is a sign of the new birth, and is called therefore the washing of regeneration, Tit 3:5. But it is by the Spirit, only by the renewing of the Holy Ghost, that we are made members of Christ's body. And by communion with Christ at the Lord's supper, we are strengthened, not by drinking the wine, but by drinking into one Spirit. Each member has its form, place, and use. The meanest makes a part of the body. There must be a distinction of members in the body. So Christ's members have different powers and different places. We should do the duties of our own place, and not murmur, or quarrel with others. All the members of the body are useful and necessary to each other. Nor is there a member of the body of Christ, but may and ought to be useful to fellow-members. As in the natural body of man, the members should be closely united by the strongest bonds of love; the good of the whole should be the object of all. All Christians are dependent one upon another; each is to expect and receive help from the rest. Let us then have more of the spirit of union in our religion.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Which seem to be more feeble - Weaker than the rest; which seem less able to bear fatigue and to encounter difficulties; which are more easily injured, and which become more easily affected with disease. It is possible that Paul may here refer to the brain, the lungs, the heart, etc., as more feeble in their structure, and more liable to disease than the hands and the feet, etc., and in reference to which disease is more dangerous and fatal.<p>Are more necessary - The sense seems to be this. A man can live though the parts and members of his body which are more strong were removed; but not if those parts which are more feeble. A man can live if his arm or his leg be amputated; but not if his brain, his lungs or his heart be removed. So that, although these parts are more feeble, and more easily injured, they are really more necessary to life, and therefore more useful than the more vigorous portions of the frame. Perhaps the idea is - and it is a beautiful thought - that those members of the church which are most retiring and feeble apparently which are concealed from public view, unnoticed and unknown - the humble. the meek, the peaceful, and the prayerful - are often more necessary to the true welfare of the church than those who are eminent for their talent and learning. And it is so. The church can better spare many a man, even in the ministry, who is learned, and eloquent, and popular, than some obscure and humble Christian, that is to the church what the heart and the lungs are to the life. the one is strong. vigorous, active, like the hands or the feet, and the church often depends on them; the other is feeble, concealed, yet vital, like the heart or the lungs. The vitality of the church could be continued though the man of talent and learning should be removed; as the body may live when the arm or the leg is amputated; but that vitality could not continue if the saint of humble and retiring piety, and of fervent prayerfulness, were removed, any more than the body can live when there is no heart and no lungs. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. more feeble&#8212;more susceptible of injury: for example, the brain, the belly, the eye.

Such contemptuous treatment can find no warrant either in the weakness, or the less honourable character, or the unseemliness of any member; for the members which we count weak are shielded from depreciation by their necessity; those held less honourable, by their more honourable dress; and those which are unseemly, by their seemly covering.” Since, however, it is of itself undoubted that he reckoned the <span class="ital">pudenda</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὰ αἰδοῖα</span>) and the <span class="ital">breech</span> among the <span class="greekheb">ἀσχήμονα</span>, we may further, without arbitrariness, set down the delicate organs of sense, such as the <span class="ital">eye and ear</span>, among the <span class="greekheb">ἀσθενέστερα</span>, and among the <span class="greekheb">ἀτιμότερα</span> again the members specially cared for in the way of adornment by dress, such as the trunk, hips, and shoulders.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολλῷ μᾶλλον</span>] the logical <span class="ital">multo potius</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰ δοκοῦντα</span>] <span class="ital">which appear</span>, like <span class="greekheb">ἃ δοκοῦμεν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm" title="And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.">1 Corinthians 12:23</a>.

Ed[1923] reads the assertion as directed against philosophy; “where Aristotle says ‘nature,’ P. says ‘God’ ”.—<span class="greekheb">τῷ ὑστερουμένῳ περισσοτέραν δοὺς τιμήν</span>, “to the part which suffers lack (<span class="ital">opus habenti</span>, Cv[1924]: <span class="ital">cf.</span>, note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm" title="So that you come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>) having assigned more abundant honour”; so that the human instinct respecting the ignobler organs of the body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-23.htm" title="And those members of the body, which we think to be less honorable, on these we bestow more abundant honor; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness.">1 Corinthians 12:23</a>) is the reflex of a Divine ordinance: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-14.htm" title="Does not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame to him?">1 Corinthians 11:14</a> f., to the like effect.—“That there may not be division (<span class="greekheb">σχίσμα</span>: see parls.) in the body”—the manifestation of the jealousy or scorn depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-16.htm" title="And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?">1 Corinthians 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-21.htm" title="And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.">1 Corinthians 12:21</a>, which have their counterpart at present in the Cor[1925] Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-10.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.">1 Corinthians 1:10</a> ff., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="And these things, brothers, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you be puffed up for one against another.">1 Corinthians 4:6</a>, etc.).—The opposite state of things (<span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>), so desirable in the spiritual organism, is realised by Divine art in the natural: “God tempered the body together” in this way, “that … the members might have the same solicitude for one another”. The physical members are obliged, by the structure of the frame, to care for one another; the hand is as anxious to guard the eye or the stomach, to help the mouth or the foot, as to serve itself; the eye is watchman for every other organ; each feels its own usefulness and cherishes its fellows; all “have the same care,” since they have the same interest—that of “the one body”. This <span class="ital">societas membrorum</span> makes the physical order both a parable of and a basis for the spiritual.
