Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1Corinthians 8:1</a>), and the Apostle replies to inquiries regarding the comparative value and importance of certain spiritual gifts. In this early age the Church was full of the divine energy of spiritual youth. From the indwelling Spirit of God resulted certain marvellous “gifts,” some of which ceased with the apostolic age—some of which seem to have lingered for centuries, even to our own day—declaring themselves intermittently in times of profound religious awakening. The party spirit with which the Corinthian Church seems to have been saturated naturally led to diverse views as to the relative importance of certain of these gifts—some were unduly exalted, some unduly depreciated. The truth that these gifts are valuable as evidence of the indwelling Spirit, and so far as they could be useful for the Church, was forgotten. The Apostle reserves for consideration in more detail (see 1 Corinthians 13) the special gift of tongues, which was, perhaps, the gift most exaggerated and most misunderstood at Corinth, and deals in this chapter with the subject of spiritual gifts generally. The subject of the chapter is <span class= "ital">The Source, Object, and Value of Spiritual Gifts,</span> and the chapter may be thus subdivided:—<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1Corinthians 12:1-3</a>.

The abundance of these gifts in the churches of Greece, strongly refuted the idle learning of the Greek philosophers. But the Corinthians did not use those gifts wisely, which occasioned the apostle’s writing concerning them. In doing this, after putting the brethren at Corinth in mind that before their conversion they were worshippers of idols, which, being themselves dumb, could not impart to their votaries the ability of speaking foreign languages, as Christ had done to many of his disciples; and after giving the Corinthians a rule by which they might judge correctly of every one who pretended to possess those gifts by divine inspiration, He, 1st, Speaks of the diversity of the gifts, which God by his Spirit had conferred on his church, of the various administrations and offices appointed by the same Lord, and of the different operations of Him that <span class="ital">worketh all in all, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1 Corinthians 12:1 to 1Co 11:2</a> dly, He describes the unity of the body, with its various members, and their uses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ....">1 Corinthians 12:12-30</a>. 3dly, Shows the way of exercising gifts rightly, namely, by love, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>. throughout; and adds, 4thly, A comparison of several gifts with each other in chap. 14. <span class="ital">I would not have you ignorant </span>— Of the Author, nature, ends, and uses of these gifts. <span class="ital">Ye know that ye were Gentiles</span> — Idolatrous heathen, and were then destitute of all spiritual gifts.

Gifts and graces greatly differ. Both were freely given of God. But where grace is given, it is for the salvation of those who have it. Gifts are for the advantage and salvation of others; and there may be great gifts where there is no grace. The extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit were chiefly exercised in the public assemblies, where the Corinthians seem to have made displays of them, wanting in the spirit of piety, and of Christian love. While heathens, they had not been influenced by the Spirit of Christ. No man can call Christ Lord, with believing dependence upon him, unless that faith is wrought by the Holy Ghost. No man could believe with his heart, or prove by a miracle, that Jesus was Christ, unless by the Holy Ghost. There are various gifts, and various offices to perform, but all proceed from one God, one Lord, one Spirit; that is, from the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, the origin of all spiritual blessings. No man has them merely for himself. The more he profits others, the more will they turn to his own account. The gifts mentioned appear to mean exact understanding, and uttering the doctrines of the Christian religion; the knowledge of mysteries, and skill to give advice and counsel. Also the gift of healing the sick, the working of miracles, and to explain Scripture by a peculiar gift of the Spirit, and ability to speak and interpret languages. If we have any knowledge of the truth, or any power to make it known, we must give all the glory of God. The greater the gifts are, the more the possessor is exposed to temptations, and the larger is the measure of grace needed to keep him humble and spiritual; and he will meet with more painful experiences and humbling dispensations. We have little cause to glory in any gifts bestowed on us, or to despise those who have them not.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now concerning - it is now time that I should speak of spiritual endowments.

The Use and the Abuse of Spiritual Gifts, Especially Prophesying and Tongues.<p>This is the second subject for correction in the Corinthian assemblies: the "first" was discussed (1Co 11:18-34).<p>1. spiritual gifts&#8212;the signs of the Spirit's continued efficacious presence in the Church, which is Christ's body, the complement of His incarnation, as the body is the complement of the head. By the love which pervades the whole, the gifts of the several members, forming reciprocal complements to each other, tend to the one object of perfecting the body of Christ. The ordinary and permanent gifts are comprehended together with the extraordinary, without distinction specified, as both alike flow from the divine indwelling Spirit of life. The extraordinary gifts, so far from making professors more peculiarly saints than in our day, did not always even prove that such persons were in a safe state at all (Mt 7:22). They were needed at first in the Church: (1) as a pledge to Christians themselves who had just passed over from Judaism or heathendom, that God was in the Church; (2) for the propagation of Christianity in the world; (3) for the edification of the Church. Now that we have the whole written New Testament (which they had not) and Christianity established as the result of the miracles, we need no further miracle to attest the truth. So the pillar of cloud which guided the Israelites was withdrawn when they were sufficiently assured of the Divine Presence, the manifestation of God's glory being thenceforward enclosed in the Most Holy Place [Archbishop Whately]. Paul sets forth in order: (1). The unity of the body (1Co 12:1-27). (2). The variety of its members and functions (1Co 12:27-30). (3). The grand principle for the right exercise of the gifts, namely, love (1Co 12:31; 1Co 13:1-13). (4) The comparison of the gifts with one another (1Co 14:1-40).<p>I would not have you ignorant&#8212;with all your boasts of "knowledge" at Corinth.

Therefore the apostle tells them, that as to them, he would not have them <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ignorant, </span> either of the favour of God in enriching them with them, as he had said, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-5.htm" title="That in every thing you are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;">1 Corinthians 1:5</a></span>, or yet in the due and right use of them, so as God might have glory from their good use of them: or of the errors that they had ran into, or might further run into, in the ill use of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now concerning spiritual gifts,.... Though the word "gifts" is not in the original text, it is rightly supplied by our translators, as it is in the Arabic version: for the apostle does not mean spiritual graces, nor spiritual words, or doctrines, nor spiritual meats and drinks, nor spiritual men, each of which are mentioned before in this epistle; though the latter is thought by some to be here intended, and that the apostle's view is to show the difference between those that are spiritual, and those that are not; but as spiritual gifts are the subject of the apostle's discourse throughout this chapter, and the two following, they seem very manifestly to be designed here. The apostle having gone through various heads of discourse, which he either of himself, or at the request of others, wrote upon, proceeds to a new subject, that of spiritual gifts, which he seems to have been desired to give his thoughts upon, and advice about; since there were some in this church who were discouraged, because they had not the gifts which some had; and others that had them were elated and puffed up with them, and treated those below them with neglect and contempt; and with a view to both these the apostle writes as follows, <p>brethren, I would not have you ignorant; neither of the author of these gifts, who is the Spirit of God, who dispenses them according to his sovereign will and pleasure, and not according to the deserts of men, and are not acquired by the industry, or through the merit of any, but are his free grace gifts; nor of the nature of them, for there are differences and diversities of them, some have one, and some another, but no man all; nor of the design and use of them, which is the edification of the whole body; and every gift, though ever so mean, is of service; and therefore as, on the one hand, none ought to be discouraged, so, on the other hand, none should be lifted up with pride, or give way to a boasting spirit. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_corinthians/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_corinthians/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δέ</span>] leads over from the matter previously discussed to another, in connection with which also abuses had crept into the church (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-18.htm" title="For first of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that there be divisions among you; and I partly believe it.">1 Corinthians 11:18</a>).

The words <span class="greekheb">διαιρέσεις</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-4.htm" title="Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit.">1 Corinthians 12:4</a> and <span class="greekheb">πάντα ταῦτα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1 Corinthians 12:11</a> give the clue to Paul’s intent in this §. Many Cor[1812] took a low and half superstitious view of the Holy Spirit’s influence, seeing in such charisms as the “tongues”—phenomena analogous to, though far surpassing, pagan manifestations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm" title="You know that you were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as you were led.">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>)—the proper evidence of His working, while they underrated endowments of a less striking but more vital and serviceable nature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="And now stays faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.">1 Corinthians 13:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-12.htm" title="Even so you, for as much as you are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that you may excel to the edifying of the church.">1 Corinthians 14:12</a>).

Spiritual Gifts; their origin and character<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“We have often to remind ourselves that this Epistle was addressed to a Church in a state of faction. One cause of rivalry was the merits of their respective teachers; another was the endowments of various kinds given to the members of the Church.”—Robertson. This and the next two chapters are concerned with the great outpouring of spiritual energy which followed the preaching of the Gospel. St Paul deals with it in his usual manner. He characteristically lays down broad principles in this and the next chapter before he proceeds to the details of ch. 14. He is specially solicitous to do so here because of the danger, so often since experienced in the Church (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-32.htm" title="And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.">1 Corinthians 14:32</a>), of the belief that a condition of great spiritual exaltation absolved men from the necessity of consulting their reason. The Apostle teaches that spiritual gifts are no less to be restrained in their exercise by considerations of decency, of order, of what is due to others, than gifts of a more ordinary kind. Therefore he takes occasion to shew (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant....">1 Corinthians 12:1-11</a></span>) that <span class="ital">all</span> gifts proceed from one source, and that miraculous powers are no more gifts of the Spirit than some others not supposed to be miraculous, and then (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ....">1 Corinthians 12:12-30</a></span>) that neither he who possesses them has any right to despise him who does not, nor he who does not possess them to envy him who does, since ‘each has his own proper gift of God.’ He goes on further (ch. 13) to point out the ‘more excellent way’ of love, and finally, in ch. 14, proceeds to lay down the regulations necessary for the preservation of order in the Christian assemblies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_corinthians/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-1.htm" title="Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I would not have you ignorant.">1 Corinthians 12:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Περὶ δε τῶν πνενματικῶν</span>, <span class="ital">Now concerning spiritual gifts</span>) This is in the Neuter gender, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-1.htm" title="Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.">1 Corinthians 14:1</a>. Some may wonder, that there is no discussion in the other epistles also on the gifts, in which however other churches were not wanting, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-36.htm" title="What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-5.htm" title="He therefore that ministers to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?">Galatians 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/1-5.htm" title="For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Ghost, and in much assurance; as you know what manner of men we were among you for your sake.">1 Thessalonians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="For this cause also thank we God without ceasing, because, when you received the word of God which you heard of us, you received it not as the word of men, but as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually works also in you that believe.">1 Thessalonians 2:13</a>. The abundance of gifts in the Greek churches was a powerful confutation of the learned but vain curiosity of the Greeks. The abuse of them afforded Paul an occasion of writing to the Corinthians; and here we may observe the mark of divine wisdom, inasmuch as every book of the Sacred Scripture, even of the New Testament, has discussed certain subjects peculiar to itself. The Corinthians abounded in <span class="ital">spiritual</span> gifts, and yet Paul had occasion to write to them, as well on other matters, as also on this topic, and that too without delay: comp. ch. 11 at the end. Now, there is set forth here; I. The unity of the body, verses 1–27. II. The variety of its members and functions, verses 27–30. III. The grand principle, on which the gifts may be rightly exercised, viz., by love, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-31.htm" title="But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet show I to you a more excellent way.">1 Corinthians 12:31</a>, and in the whole of the following chapter. 4. The comparison of the gifts with one another, ch. 14.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ θἐλω ὑμᾶς ἀγνοεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">I would not have you ignorant</span>) This expression is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-3.htm" title="Why I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calls Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.">1 Corinthians 12:3</a> in synonymous terms, as if after a parenthesis.—<span class="greekheb">ἀγνοεῖν</span>, to <span class="ital">be ignorant</span>) ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-38.htm" title="But if any man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.">1 Corinthians 14:38</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_corinthians/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-11.</span> - <span class="accented">On spiritual gifts in general.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Now concerning spiritual gifts;</span> rather, <span class="accented">things spiritual.</span> The context, however, shows that St. Paul is thinking almost exclusively of the gifts (<span class="accented">charismata</span>) of the Spirit. <span class="cmt_word">I would not have you ignorant</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-1.htm">1 Corinthians 10:1</a>).

"Before this consciousness of a higher power than their own, the ordinary and natural faculties of the human mind seemed to retire, to make way for loftier aspirations, more immediate intimations of the divine will, more visible manifestations of the divine power.... It resembled in some degree the inspiration of the Jewish judges, psalmists, and prophets; it may be illustrated by the ecstasies and visions of prophets in all religions; but in its energy and universality it was peculiar to the christian society of the apostolic age" (Stanley). </body></html>
