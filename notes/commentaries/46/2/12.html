The original word, <span class="greekheb">συγκρινοντες</span>, is rightly translated <span class="ital">interpreting, </span>or <span class="ital">explaining, </span>being used by the LXX. to denote the interpretation of dreams, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-16.htm" title="When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had three white baskets on my head:">Genesis 40:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-22.htm" title="But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to them.">Genesis 40:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/41-12.htm" title="And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did interpret....">Genesis 41:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-15.htm" title="And Pharaoh said to Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of you, that you can understand a dream to interpret it.">Genesis 41:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-4.htm" title="Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.">Daniel 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-7.htm" title="The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spoke, and said to the wise men of Babylon, Whoever shall read this writing, and show me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be the third ruler in the kingdom.">Daniel 5:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/5-12.htm" title="For as much as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.">Daniel 5:12</a>. Pearce translates the clause, <span class="ital">explaining spiritual things to spiritual men; </span>a sense which the original will doubtless bear; but it does not agree so well with the first part of the verse, where words taught by the Holy Spirit are mentioned. This language of the apostle, as Doddridge justly observes, “may certainly convince us of the great regard which we ought always to maintain to the words of Scripture; and may especially teach ministers how attentively they should study its beauties, and how careful they should be to make it the support of their discourses.” Indeed, “this language, in which the doctrines of the gospel were revealed to the apostles, and in which they delivered these doctrines to the world, is what Paul calls <span class="ital">the form of sound words, </span>which Timothy had heard from him, and was to <span class="ital">hold fast, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm" title="Hold fast the form of sound words, which you have heard of me, in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.">2 Timothy 1:13</a>. Every one, therefore, ought to beware of altering or wresting the inspired language of Scripture, in their expositions of the articles of the Christian faith. Taylor, in the sixth chapter of his <span class="ital">Key, </span>explains the verse under consideration thus: <span class="ital">Which things we speak, not in philosophical terms of human invention, but which the Spirit teacheth in the writings of the Old Testament; </span>and contends that the apostle’s meaning is, that he expressed the Christian privileges in the very same words and phrases by which the Spirit expressed the privileges of the Jewish Church, in the writings of the Old Testament. But if the Spirit suggested these words and phrases to the Jewish prophets, why might not he suggest to the apostles the words and phrases in which they communicated the gospel revelation to the world? especially as there are many discoveries in the gospel, which could not be expressed clearly, if at all, in the words by which the prophets expressed the privileges of the Jewish Church. Besides, it is evident, that when the apostles introduce into their writings the words and phrases of the Jewish prophets, they explain them in other words and phrases, which no doubt were suggested to them by the Spirit.” — See Macknight, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm" title="All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:">2 Timothy 3:16</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_corinthians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-16 God has revealed true wisdom to us by his Spirit. Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now we have received - We who are Christians; and especially we, the apostles.

The Spirit is given to us in order that we might fully understand the favors which God has conferred on us in the gospel. It was not only necessary that God should grant the blessings of redemption by the gift of His Son, but, such was the hardness and blindness of the human heart, it was needful that he should grant His Holy Spirit also, so that people might be brought fully to see and appreciate the value of those favors. For people do not see them by nature; neither does anyone see them who is not enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God.<p>The things that are freely given us - That are conferred on us as a matter of grace or favor. He here refers to the blessings of redemption - the pardon of sin, justification, sanctification, the divine favor and protection, and the hope of eternal life - These things we Know; they are not matters of conjecture; but are surely and certainly confirmed to us by the Holy Spirit. It is possible for all Christians to know and be fully assured of the truth of those things, and of their interest in them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. we &#8230; received, not &#8230; spirit of &#8230; world&#8212;the personal evil "spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience" (Eph 2:2).

So Theophylact, and after him Beza, Calvin, Grotius, and many others, including Morus, Rosenmüller, Flatt, Heydenreich, de Wette, Maier, and similarly Pott. But, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα</span> <span class="ital">must</span> denote, in keeping with the context, the <span class="ital">objective</span> spirit opposed to the Spirit of God; and that is, according to the decided dualistic view of the apostle (comp esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm" title="Wherein in time past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now works in the children of disobedience:">Ephesians 2:2</a>), the <span class="ital">diabolic</span> <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, which has blinded the understanding of the unbelievers, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-4.htm" title="In whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not, lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ, who is the image of God, should shine to them.">2 Corinthians 4:4</a>. Billroth’s explanation: that it is the <span class="ital">non-absolute</span> spirit, the finite, in so far as it persists for itself and does not resolve itself into the divine, is a modern un-Pauline importation; and this holds, too, of Hofmann’s exposition: that it is the spirit, in virtue of which the world is conscious of itself, knowing itself, however, only in that way in which alone its sinful estrangement from God leaves it possible for it to do so, not in God, namely, but out of God. If that is not to be taken as the diabolic spirit, then the conception is simply an un-Pauline fabrication, artificially worded so as to explain away the diabolic character. Lastly, Rückert’s view, that Paul meant: “we have received our <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> not from the world, but from God,” cannot even be reconciled with the words of the passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐκ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>] The <span class="greekheb">ἐκ</span> is employed by Paul here not in order to avoid the appearance of making this <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> the principle that determines the action of God (so Kling in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.
