Here is a proof of the Divine authority of the Holy Scriptures, 2Pe 1:21. In proof of the Divinity of the Holy Ghost, observe, that he knows all things, and he searches all things, even the deep things of God. No one can know the things of God, but his Holy Spirit, who is one with the Father and the Son, and who makes known Divine mysteries to his church. This is most clear testimony, both to the real Godhead and the distinct person of the Holy Spirit. The apostles were not guided by worldly principles. They had the revelation of these things from the Spirit of God, and the saving impression of them from the same Spirit. These things they declared in plain, simple language, taught by the Holy Spirit, totally different from the affected oratory or enticing words of man's wisdom. The natural man, the wise man of the world, receives not the things of the Spirit of God. The pride of carnal reasoning is really as much opposed to spirituality, as the basest sensuality. The sanctified mind discerns the real beauties of holiness, but the power of discerning and judging about common and natural things is not lost. But the carnal man is a stranger to the principles, and pleasures, and actings of the Divine life. The spiritual man only, is the person to whom God gives the knowledge of his will. How little have any known of the mind of God by natural power! And the apostles were enabled by his Spirit to make known his mind. In the Holy Scriptures, the mind of Christ, and the mind of God in Christ, are fully made known to us. It is the great privilege of Christians, that they have the mind of Christ revealed to them by his Spirit. They experience his sanctifying power in their hearts, and bring forth good fruits in their lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_corinthians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For what man ... - The design of this is, to illustrate what he had just said by a reference to the way in which man acquires the knowledge of himself. The purpose is to show that the Spirit has an exact and thorough knowledge of the things of God; and this is done by the very striking thought that no man can know his own mind, his own plans and intentions, but himself - his own spirit. The essential idea is, that no man can know another; that his thoughts and designs can only be known by himself, or by his own spirit; and that unless he chooses to reveal them to others, they cannot ascertain them. So of God. No man can penetrate his designs; and unless he chooses to make them known by his Spirit, they must forever remain inscrutable to human view.<p>The things of a man - The "deep things" - the hidden counsels, thoughts, plans, intentions.<p>Save the spirit of man ... - Except his own mind; that is, himself. No other man can fully know them. By the spirit of man here, Paul designs to denote the human soul - or the intellect of man. It is not to be supposed that he here intends to convey the idea that there is a perfect resemblance between the relation which the soul of man bears to the man, and the relation which the Holy Spirit bears to God. The illustration is to be taken in regard to the point immediately before him - which is, that no one could know and communicate the deep thoughts and plans of God except his Spirit - just as no one could penetrate into the intentions of a man, and fully know them, but himself. The passage proves, therefore, that there is a knowledge which the Spirit has of God, which no man, no angel can obtain, just as every man's spirit has a knowledge of his own plans which no other man can obtain; that the Spirit of God can communicate his plans and deep designs, just as a man can communicate his own intentions; and consequently, that while there is a distinction of some kind between the Spirit of God and God, as there is a distinction which makes it proper to say that a man has an intelligent soul, yet there is such a profound and intimate knowledge of God by the Spirit, that he must be equal with him; and such an intimate union, that he can be called "the Spirit of God," and be one with God, as the human soul can be called "the spirit of the man," and be one with him.<p>In all respects we are not to suppose that there is a similarity. In these points there is - It may be added that the union, the oneness of the Spirit of God with God, is no more absurd or inexplicable than the union of the spirit of man with the man; or the oneness of the complex person made up of body and soul, which we call man. When people have explained all the difficulties about themselves - in regard to their own bodies and spirits, it will be time to advance objections against the doctrines here stated in regard to God.<p>Even so - To the same extent; in like manner.<p>The things of God - His deep purposes and plans.<p>Knoweth no man - Man cannot search into them - any more than one man can search the intentions of another. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_corinthians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. what man, &c.&#8212;literally, "who of men knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of that man?"<p>things of God knoweth no man&#8212;rather, "none knoweth," not angel or man.

It is true as it is with man; when he hath by his tongue discovered his mind to others, they know it so far as he hath so delivered it; but there is no man that discovereth all his thoughts and counsels: so God having in his word revealed his will so far as he hath plainly revealed it men may know it; but there are <span class="ital">deep things of God, </span> mysteries in Scripture, which, till the Spirit of God hath revealed to men, they know not nor understand; for none knoweth them originally, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">but the Spirit of God, </span> who is himself God, and <span class="ital">searcheth the deep things of God.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_corinthians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For what man knoweth the things of a man,....

We are neither, therefore, to understand it so that the Spirit of God appears as the soul of the divine substance (Hallet; see, on the other hand, Heilmann, <span class="ital">Opusc.</span> II.), nor as if He were not distinct from God (see, on the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1 Corinthians 2:10</a>), but simply so that the Spirit of God, the ground of the divine personal life, appears in His relation to God <span class="ital">as the principle of the divine self-knowledge</span>, in the same way as the principle of the human self-knowledge is the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> of the man, which constitutes his personal life. Hence God is known only by His Spirit, as the man is only by his spirit, as the vehicle of his own self-consciousness, not by another man. With <span class="greekheb">τὸ πνεῦμα τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, Paul does not again join <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐν αὐτῷ</span>, because the <span class="ital">man’s</span> spirit indeed is shut up <span class="ital">in</span> the man, but not so the Divine Spirit in God; the latter, on the contrary, goes forth also from Him, is communicated, and is <span class="greekheb">τὸ τνεῦμα τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_corinthians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-11.htm" title="For what man knows the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knows no man, but the Spirit of God.">1 Corinthians 2:11</a>. “For amongst men, who knows (<span class="greekheb">οἶδεν</span>) the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that is within him? So also the things of God none has perceived (<span class="greekheb">ἔγνωκεν</span>), except the Spirit of God.” Far from being otiose, <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπων</span> is emphatic: P. argues from human to Divine personality; each heart of man has its secrets (<span class="greekheb">τὰ τοῦ ἀνθρώπου</span>); “nor even the dearest soul, and next our own, knows half the reasons why we smile or sigh”; there is a corresponding region of inner personal consciousness with <span class="ital">God</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὰ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>). As the man’s own spirit lifts the veil and lights the recesses penetrable by no reasoning from without, so God’s Spirit must communicate His thoughts,—or we shall never know them. This reserve belongs to the rights of self-hood. Paul’s axiomatic saying assumes the personality of God, and man’s affinity to God grounded therein. P. does not in this analogy limit the <span class="greekheb">Ἅγιον Πνεῦμα</span> by human conditions, nor reduce Him to a mere Divine self-consciousness (<span class="greekheb">τὸ ἐκ τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-12.htm" title="Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God.">1 Corinthians 2:12</a>, guards us against this); the argument is <span class="ital">a minori ad majus</span> (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-15.htm" title="Brothers, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man cancels, or adds thereto.">Galatians 3:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-7.htm" title="For scarcely for a righteous man will one die: yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die.">Romans 5:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-13.htm" title="If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?">Luke 11:13</a>), and valid for the point in question.
