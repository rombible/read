The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Before Him went (goeth) the pestilence - then to consume His enemies. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-27.htm">Exodus 23:27</a> : "I will send My fear before thee, and will destroy all the people, to whom thou shalt come," and the lightnings are a token that, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68-1.htm">Psalm 68:1-2</a>, "they which hate Him, flee before Him, and the wicked perish at the Presence of God."

Some interpret it of hot diseases, burning fevers, so Kimchi; which are at the command of God, and sent forth by him when he pleases, to do his will.

For "pestilence" the LXX. reads "word." Burning coals went forth at his feet. "Fiery belts" followed his advance, "hailstones and coals of fire" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12, 13</a>); as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-8.htm">Psalm 97:8</a>, "A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies on every side."

"And it comes to pass at the end of the days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house will be established on the head of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and nations stream to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>. And many nations go, and say, Up, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways, and we may walk in His paths: for from Zion will law go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. And He will judge between many nations, and pronounce sentence on strong nations afar off; and they forge their swords into coulters, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>. And they will sit, every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it."<p>(Note: This promise is placed by Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) at the head of his prophecy of Zion's way through judgment from the false glory to the true. The originality of the passage in Micah is open to no question. Delitzsch acknowledges this, and has given the principal arguments in its favour in the Commentary on Isaiah. For still more elaborate proofs, see Caspari's Micha, pp. 444-5.)<p>By the phrase "at the end of the days," which always denotes the Messianic era when used by the prophets (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), the predicted exaltation of the temple mountain is assigned to the period of the completion of the kingdom of God. The mountain of the house of Jehovah is the temple mountain, strictly speaking, Moriah, as the distinction made between the mountain of the house and Zion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> clearly shows; but as a subordinate peak of Zion, it is embraced along with Zion in what follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>) as the seat of Jehovah's rule, from which the law proceeds. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean placed or set up, but established, founded. By connecting the participle with &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the founding is designated as a permanent one. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, upon (not at) the top of the mountains, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-13.htm">1 Samuel 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; whereas such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a> are of a different character, and have no bearing upon the point. The temple mountain, or Zion, will be so exalted above all the mountains and hills, that it will appear to be founded upon the top of the mountains. This exaltation is of course not a physical one, as Hofmann, Drechsler, and several of the Rabbins suppose, but a spiritual (ethical) elevation above all the mountains. This is obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, according to which Zion will tower above all the mountains, because the law of the Lord issues from it. The assumption of a physical elevation cannot be established from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, for in the visions described in both these passages the earthly elevation is a symbol of a spiritual one. "Through a new revelation of the Lord, which is made upon it, and which leaves the older revelations far behind, whether made upon Sinai or upon itself, Zion becomes the greatest and loftiest mountain in the world" (Caspari), and the mountain seen from afar, to which "nations" stream, and not merely the one nation of Israel.<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is more precisely defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> as &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The attractive power which this mountain exerts upon the nations, so that they call upon one another to go up to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), does not reside in its height, which towers above that of all other mountains, but in the fact that the house of the God of Jacob stands upon it, i.e., that Jehovah is enthroned there, and teacher how to walk in His ways. &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, to teach out of the ways, so that the ways of God form the material from which they derive continual instruction. The desire for salvation, therefore, is the motive which prompts them to this pilgrimage; for they desire instruction in the ways of the Lord, that they may walk in them. The ways of Jehovah are the ways which God takes in His dealing with men, and by which men are led by Him; in reality, therefore, the ordinances of salvation which He has revealed in His word, the knowledge and observance of which secure life and blessedness. The words "for the law goes forth from Zion," etc., are words spoken not by the nations, but by the prophet, and assign the reason why the heathen go with such zeal to the mountain of Jehovah. The accent is laid upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (from Zion), which stands at the head, and &#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; (from Jerusalem), which is parallel to it. Thence does to&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., instruction in the ways of God, proceed, - in other words, the law as the rule of a godly life, and debhar Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the word of Jehovah), or the word of revelation as the source of salvation. It is evident from this that the mountain of the house of God is not thought of here as the place of worship, but as the scene of divine revelation, the centre of the kingdom of God. Zion is the source of the law and word of the Lord, from which the nations draw instruction how to walk in the ways of God, to make it their own, take it to their homes, and walk according to it. The fruit of this adoption of the word of the Lord will be, that they will not longer fight out their disputes with weapons of war, but let Jehovah judge and settle them, and thus acknowledge Him as their King and Judge. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; signifies to act as judge; &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; (lit., to set right), to settle and put a stop to a dispute. "Many nations," in contrast with the one nation, which formerly was alone in acknowledge Jehovah as its King and Judge. This is strengthened still further by the parallel "strong, mighty nations afar off." In consequence of this they will turn their weapons into instruments of peaceful agriculture, and wage no more war; in fact, they will learn war no more, no longer exercise themselves in the use of arms. For the words &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, where the summons to the nations to a decisive conflict with the kingdom of God is described as turning the instruments of agriculture into weapons of war. With the cessation of war, universal peace will ensue, and Israel will have no further enemies to fear, so that every one will have undisturbed enjoyment of the blessings of peace, of which Israel had had a foretaste during the peaceful reign of Solomon. The words "sit under his vine" are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), and &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; from the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. All this, however incredible it might appear, not only for the Israel of that time, but even now under the Christian dispensation, will assuredly take place, for the mouth of Jehovah the true God has spoken it. </body></html>
