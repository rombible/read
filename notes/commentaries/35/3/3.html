The Authorised Version has unfortunately rendered all the verbs in this section in the <span class= "ital">past</span> tense, thus obscuring the sense of the poem. They all refer to a scene really future, but brought by the grasp of faith into the immediate <span class= "ital">present.</span> In the Hebrew some of these verbs are in the future tense, others in the past used with the force of a present, the “prophetic perfect” as it is sometimes termed. Such a use of the Hebrew preterite is common in Biblical poetry, notably in the Book of Psalms. It is almost impossible to reproduce in English the slight distinction between these tenses. While, however, his eyes are thus fixed on a future deliverance, the basis of all Habakkuk’s anticipations is God’s doings in time past; the chief features in the portraiture are, in fact, borrowed from the Books of Exodus and Judges.<p>(3) <span class= "bld">God came</span>.—Render “<span class= "ital">God shall come from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran. Selah. His glory covers the heavens, and the earth is full of His praise.</span>” Jehovah reveals Himself from the south: <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> from Mount Sinai, as in Deuteronomy 32, Judges 5, Psalms 68. The southern country is here designated as “Teman,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> Edom to the S.E., and “Paran,” the mountainous region to the S.W., between Edom and Egypt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/habakkuk/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.">Habakkuk 3:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">God came from Teman, </span>&c. — Bishop Lowth observes, that “this chapter affords us a remarkable instance of that sublimity which is peculiar to the <span class="ital">ode, </span>and which is principally owing to a bold and yet easy digression, or transition. The prophet, foreseeing the judgments of God, the calamities which were to be brought upon his countrymen by the Chaldeans, and then the punishments which awaited the Chaldeans themselves; partly struck with terror, partly revived with hope and confidence in the divine mercy, he prays that God would hasten the redemption and deliverance of his people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.">Habakkuk 3:3</a>. Now here immediately occurs to every one’s mind a similitude between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivity; that it was possible an equal deliverance might be procured by the help of God; and how aptly the prophet might so have continued his prayer, namely, that God, who had wrought so many miracles in ancient days for the sake of his people, would likewise continue his providential regard toward them; and how much it would contribute to confirm and strengthen the minds of the pious, who should remember, that the God who formerly had manifested his infinite power in rescuing the Israelites out of such great calamities, was able to do the same by avenging their posterity likewise. But the prophet has omitted all these topics, for this very reason, because they so readily occur to the mind; and instead of expatiating in so large a field, he bursts forth with an unexpected impetuosity, <span class="ital">God came from Teman, </span>&c.” — <span class="ital">Præl. Hebrews </span>28. Habakkuk, therefore, having offered up his petitions to God for the preservation and support of his people during their captivity, proceeds, from hence to <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm" title="When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he comes up to the people, he will invade them with his troops.">Habakkuk 3:16</a>, to recount, for their encouragement, the wonderful works which Jehovah had formerly wrought for them to deliver them from Egyptian slavery, and to put them in possession of the land of Canaan, intimating by this, that he would in due time show himself equally powerful in delivering them from the Babylonish captivity, and restoring them to their own land. In recounting these wonderful works he first exhibits a description of Jehovah, as king and commander of the thousands of Israel, marching at their head in a pillar of a cloud, to conduct them, and put them in possession of the promised land. When Jehovah sets out from <span class="ital">Teman </span>and <span class="ital">Paran, </span>so great is the majesty and glory with which he is arrayed, that the heaven and the earth are too little to contain them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm" title="God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah. His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his praise.">Habakkuk 3:3</a>.

As soon as he enters the land of Canaan, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm" title="He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.">Habakkuk 3:6</a>,) he takes possession of it as rightful Lord; and the seven nations of Canaan, conscious that they had forfeited it by their wickedness, flee at the sight of him. The mountains of the land disperse to make way for him, the hills bow to pay him obeisance, and the highways own him for their Lord; and so great is the dread of him, that the neighbouring nations tremble while he passes by, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-7.htm" title="I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.">Habakkuk 3:7</a>. “Throughout the whole passage the prophet preserves the same magnificence with which he begins, choosing the noblest images which so copious a subject could afford, and illustrating them with the most splendid colours, images, figures, and the most elevated style. What crowns the sublimity of this piece, is the singular elegance of the close; and were it not that antiquity hath here and there thrown its veil of obscurity over it, there could not be conceived a more perfect and masterly poem of the kind.” — Bishop Lowth. “The grandest images,” adds Bishop Newcome, “are selected; and the diction is as splendid as the subjects.” <span class="ital">Teman </span>is thought to have been first the name of an encampment, and afterward of an Idumean city: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm" title="Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was come on him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come to mourn with him and to comfort him.">Job 2:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm" title="Concerning Edom, thus said the LORD of hosts; Is wisdom no more in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is their wisdom vanished?">Jeremiah 49:7</a>. <span class="ital">Paran </span>was a part of Arabia Petræa, near mount Sinai: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm" title="And he dwelled in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt.">Genesis 21:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm" title="And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir to them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law for them.">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. <span class="ital">His glory covered the heavens — </span>That excessive splendour which filled the air when God descended on mount Sinai, in flames of fire, lightnings, and thunders, to give the law to his people. <span class="ital">And the earth was full of his praise — </span>Green reads, <span class="ital">And his glory filled the earth.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:3-15 God's people, when in distress, and ready to despair, seek help by considering the days of old, and the years of ancient times, and by pleading them with God in prayer. The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>God came - literally, shall come<p>From Teman - "God shall come," as He came of old, clothed with majesty and power; but it was not mere power. The center of the whole picture is, as Micah and Isaiah had prophesied that it was to be, a new revelation Isa 2:3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> : "The law shall go forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem." <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-5.htm">Isaiah 44:5</a>, "I will give Thee for a covenant to the people (Israel), for a light of the Gentiles." So now, speaking of the new work in store, Habakkuk renews the imagery in the Song of Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, in Deborah's Song <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-5.htm">Judges 5:5</a>, and in David; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm">Psalm 68:7</a> but there the manifestation of His glory is spoken of wholly in time past, and Mount Sinai is named. Habakkuk speaks of that coming as yet to be, and omits the express mention of Mount Sinai, which was the emblem of the law . And so he directs us to another Lawgiver, whom God should raise up like unto Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15-18</a>, yet with a law of life, and tells how He who spake the law, God, shall come in likeness of our flesh. And the Holy One from Mount Paran In the earliest passage three places are mentioned, in which or from which the glory of God was manifested; with this difference however, that it is said <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, The Lord came from Sinai, but His glory arose, as we should say "dawned"  unto them from Seir, and flashed forth  from Mount Paran  Seir and Mount Paran are joined together by the symbol of the light which dawned or shone forth from them. In the second passage, the Song of Deborah, Seir and the field of Edom are the place whence God came forth; Sinai melted <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4-5</a> at His presence.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> the mention of Edom is dropped; and the march through the wilderness under the leading of God, is alone mentioned, together with the shaking of Sinai. In Habakkuk, the contrast is the same as in Moses; only Tehran stands in place of Seir . Theman and Mount Paran are named probably, as the two opposed boundaries of the journeyings of Israel through the desert. They came to Mount Sinai through the valley, now called Wady Feiran  or Paran; Edom was the bound of their wanderings to their promised land <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/20-14.htm">Numbers 20:14-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2.htm">Deuteronomy 2</a>. God who guided, fed, protected them from the beginning, led them to the end. Between Paran also and Edom or Teman was the gift of the Spirit to the seventy, which was the shadow of the day of Pentecost; there, was the brass serpent lifted up, the picture of the healing of the Cross . If Mount Paran is near Kadesh, then Moses in the opening of his song describes the glory of God as manifested from that first revelation of His Law on Mount Sinai; then in that long period of Israel's waiting there to its final departure for the promised land, when Mount Hor was consecrated and God's awful Holiness declared in the death of Aaron.<p>He who "shall come," is God , "the Holy One" (a proper name of gods) . Perfect in Holiness, as God, the Son of God, and as Man also all-holy, with a human will, always exactly accompanying the Divine Will, which was:<p>"The passion of His Heart<p>Those Three-and-thirty years."<p>On this there follows a pause denoted by "Selah"  (which occurs thrice according to the mystery of that number,) that the soul may dwell on the greatness of the majesty and mercy of God.<p>Selah - There is no doubt as to the general purport of the word, that it is a musical direction, that there should be a pause, the music probably continuing alone, while the mind rested upon the thought, which had just been presented to it; our "interlude" . It is always placed at some pause of thought, even when not at the end of a strophe, or, as twice in this hymn , at the end of the verse.<p>Gregory of Nyssa modifies this thought, supposing "Selah" to express a pause made by the writer, that  "while the psalmody, with which David's prophesying was accompanied, went on in its course, another illumining of the Holy Spirit, and an addition to the gift according to knowledge, came for the benefit of those who received the prophecy, he, holding in his verse, gave time for his mind to receive the knowledge of the thought, which took place in him from the divine illumining. He defines it to be "a sudden silence in the midst of the Psalmody for the reception of the illumining."<p>His Glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of His praise - This is plainly no created glory, but anticipates the Angelic Hymn <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm">Luke 2:14</a> "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will toward men," or, as the Seraphim sing first glory to God in Heaven <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-3.htm">Isaiah 6:3</a>, "Holy Holy Holy is the Lord God of Sabaoth," and then, the whole earth is full of His glory; and Uncreated Wisdom saith (Ecclesiasticus 24:5), "I alone compassed the circuit of Heaven, and walked in the bottom of the deep." Nor are they our material heavens, much less this lowest heaven over our earth nor is "His glory" any  of God, which rules, encompasses, fills, penetrates the orbs of heaven and all its inhabitants, and yet is not enclosed nor bounded thereby. Those who are made as the heavens by the indwelling of God He spiritually "covers," filling  them with the light of glory and splendor of grace and brightness of wisdom, as it saith, "Is there any number of His armies, and upon whom doth not His light arise? <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/25-3.htm">Job 25:3</a> and so the earth was full of His praise," i. e., the Church militant spread throughout the world, as in the Psalm Psa 112:3, "The Lord's name is praised from the rising up of the sun unto the going down of the same, and, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-1.htm">Psalm 8:1</a>, O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is Thy name in all the earth, who hast set Thy glory above the heavens." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. God&#8212;singular in the Hebrew, "Eloah," instead of "Elohim," plural, usually employed. The singular is not found in any other of the minor prophets, or Jeremiah, or Ezekiel; but it is in Isaiah, Daniel, Job, and Deuteronomy.<p>from Teman&#8212;the country south of Judea and near Edom, in which latter country Mount Paran was situated [Henderson]. "Paran" is the desert region, extending from the south of Judah to Sinai. Seir, Sinai, and Paran are adjacent to one another, and are hence associated together, in respect to God's giving of the law (De 33:2). Teman is so identified with Seir or Edom, as here to be substituted for it. Habakkuk appeals to God's glorious manifestations to His people at Sinai, as the ground for praying that God will "revive His work" (Hab 3:2) now. For He is the same God now as ever.<p>Selah&#8212;a musical sign, put at the close of sections and strophes, always at the end of a verse, except thrice; namely, here, and Hab 3:9, and Ps 55:19; 57:3, where, however, it closes the hemistich. It implies a change of the modulation. It comes from a root to "rest" or "pause" [Gesenius]; implying a cessation of the chant, during an instrumental interlude. The solemn pause here prepares the mind for contemplating the glorious description of Jehovah's manifestation which follows.<p>earth &#8230; full of his praise&#8212;that is, of His glories which were calculated to call forth universal praise; the parallelism to "glory" proves this to be the sense.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">God, </span> the God of our fathers, our God, came; appeared, discovered himself, for that is his coming, who, since he fills all places at all times, cannot be said to come by any change of place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Teman; </span> either appellatively, the south, or else as a proper name of a mountain or country. so called from Teman, son of Eliphaz, and grandson of Esau.

Or, "may God come from Teman" (t); since it is part of the prayer of Habakkuk: or, as "from Teman" (u); as he of old came from thence, a city in the land of Edom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7</a> it was five miles from Petra, in Idumea, where was Mount Seir, from whence the Lord arose, and shone forth from Mount Paran, at the giving of the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> to which the allusion is here. So the Targum, <p>"at the giving of the law to his people, God was revealed from the south;'' <p>for so Teman signifies. The prophet, to encourage his own faith, and the faith of others, takes notice, in this and the following verses, of the instances of the grace, goodness, and power of God to his people Israel, in appearing to them at Mount Sinai, going before them in the wilderness, destroying their enemies, casting them out before them, and introducing them into the land of Canaan, and settling them there; suggesting, that he that had done these great and wonderful things would support and maintain, carry on and promote, his own kingdom and interest in the world; in order to which the prophet prays to God the Father for the coming of his Son, either in the flesh, that the incarnate God would appear in the world, and set up his kingdom in it; or, in prayer, he prophesies of it, and expresses his faith in it: "God cometh from the south"; or, "he shall come" (w), as it may be rendered: he knew, from the prophecy of Micah, that he that was to be ruler in Israel was to come from Bethlehem, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-2.htm">Micah 5:2</a> which lay to the south of Jerusalem; and from hence he expected him, and believed he would come, and prayed for it as being most desirable and welcome: or else this respects the coming of the Messiah, in the ministration of the word to Jews and Gentiles, after his resurrection from the dead, and ascension to heaven, and the pouring forth of his Spirit on the day of Pentecost; that as the Lord came from the places here mentioned, when he gave the law on Mount Sinai, so he would send forth his Gospel out of Zion and Jerusalem, and go forth himself along with it, riding in his glory, and in his majesty, conquering and to conquer; causing his ministers to triumph in him, and by them subdue multitudes of souls to him, both in Judea, and in the Gentile world, whereby his kingdom might appear in it: <p>and the Holy One from Mount Paran; or, "even the Holy One" (x); that came or shined forth "from Mount Paran" formerly; for it was Christ then that appeared on Mount Sinai, and gave to Moses the lively oracles of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a> he, as he is truly God, God manifest in the flesh, "Immanuel", God with us; so he is the holy One of God, infinitely and essentially holy, as a divine Person; and holy, and harmless, and without sin in his human nature and life; and is the sanctifier and sanctification of his people. Mount Paran was situated to the south of the land of Canaan, as well as Teman, which so signifies, as before observed. It is called by Ptolemy, Pomponius Mela, and others, Strobilus, from its likeness to a pineapple. It had its name from the city Paran, which lay between Egypt and Arabia (y); see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-18.htm">1 Kings 11:18</a> which Jerom says (z) was three days' journey from Aila to the east; mention is made of Ail, or Elparan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-6.htm">Genesis 14:6</a> near to which was the wilderness of Paran, frequently spoken of in Scripture,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-21.htm">Genesis 21:21</a> the same which Josephus (a) calls the valley or plain of Pharan, where Simon of Gerasa made caves and dens, and hid the treasure he plundered from the people: according to Adrichomius (b), it was a most dreadful barren desert, where nothing grew, or was to be had, through which the children of Israel journeyed; and was sometimes taken for the first part of the desert of Arabia, near Mount Sinai, and sometimes for the last part of it, towards the land of promise; sometimes it was called the desert of Sin, and sometimes the desert of Sinai, from that mountain; but its most general name was that of Paran, and contained eleven days' journey from Mount Sinai to Kadeshbarnea. Mount Paran (he says (c)) is thick and shady, near to Mount Sinai, and even "contiguous", as it should seem to be from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a> to which the reference is here. So Hillerus (d) interprets it, "full of boughs", or "branches"; or else he would have it to signify "the corner of Aran", the son of Dishan, a son of Seir the Horite, who inhabited this country; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-20.htm">Genesis 36:20</a> and both Teman and Paran being to the south, may point to the place of the Redeemer, by whom the great work was to be done, referred unto. Jerom says he heard a Hebrew man discourse on this passage, thus, <p>"that Bethlehem lies to the south, where the Lord and Saviour was born: and that he it is of whom it is here said, "the Lord shall come from the south"; that is, shall be born in Bethlehem, and thence arise; and because he who is born in Bethlehem formerly gave the law on Mount Sinai, he is "the Holy One" that came from "Mount Paran"; seeing Paran is a place near to Mount Sinai; and the word "Selah" signifies "always"; and the sense is, he who is born in Bethlehem, and who on Mount Sinai, that is, on Mount Paran, gave the law, always is the author and giver of all blessings, past, present, and to come.'' <p>The word <p>Selah stands here in the middle of the verse. It is interpreted, by several of the Jewish writers, "for ever", as by the aforementioned Hebrew; and by others as an affirmation, and render it, "verily, truly", as answering to "Amen".

As he then came in glory to make a covenant with his people, so will he appear again in majesty to deliver them from the power of evil and to execute judgment. The verbs throughout are best rendered in the present. The prophet takes his stand in time preceding the action of the verb, and hence uses the future tense, thus also showing that he is prophesying of a great event to come, symbolized by these earlier manifestations. Habakkuk here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a> trees the word <span class="accented">Eloah</span>, which is not found in Jeremiah, Ezekiel, or the other minor prophets; it occurs once in Isaiah, twice in Deuteronomy, and frequently in Job.

This term occurs also in vers. 9, 13, and frequently in the Psalms, but nowhere else, and indicates some change in the music when the ode was sung in the temple service. What is the exact change is a matter of great uncertainty. Some take it to indicate "a pause;" others, connecting it with <span class="accented">salah</span>, "to lift up," render it "elevation," and suppose it means the raising of the voice, or the strengthening of the accompaniment, as by the blast of trumpets. The meaning must be left undetermined, though it must be added that it is always found at the end of a verse or hemistich, where there is a pause or break in the thought, or, as some say, some strongly accented words occur. <span class="cmt_word">His glory covered the heavens.</span> His majestic brightness spread over the heavens, dimming the gleam of sun and stars; or it may mean his boundless majesty fills the highest heavens and encompasses its inhabitants. His praise. This is usually explained to signify that the earth and all that dwell therein, at this glorious manifestion, utter their praise. But there is no allusion as yet to the manner in which the appearance is received, and in ver. 6 it produces fear and trembling; so it is best to take "praise" in the sense of "matter of praise," that glory "which was calculated to call forth universal adoration" (Henderson). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise of salvation opens, in closest connection with the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, with a picture of the glory awaiting in the remotest future the temple mountain, which has now become a wild forest-height. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>. "And it comes to pass at the end of the days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house will be established on the head of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and nations stream to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>. And many nations go, and say, Up, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways, and we may walk in His paths: for from Zion will law go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. And He will judge between many nations, and pronounce sentence on strong nations afar off; and they forge their swords into coulters, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>. And they will sit, every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it."<p>(Note: This promise is placed by Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) at the head of his prophecy of Zion's way through judgment from the false glory to the true. The originality of the passage in Micah is open to no question. Delitzsch acknowledges this, and has given the principal arguments in its favour in the Commentary on Isaiah. For still more elaborate proofs, see Caspari's Micha, pp. 444-5.)<p>By the phrase "at the end of the days," which always denotes the Messianic era when used by the prophets (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), the predicted exaltation of the temple mountain is assigned to the period of the completion of the kingdom of God. The mountain of the house of Jehovah is the temple mountain, strictly speaking, Moriah, as the distinction made between the mountain of the house and Zion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> clearly shows; but as a subordinate peak of Zion, it is embraced along with Zion in what follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>) as the seat of Jehovah's rule, from which the law proceeds. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean placed or set up, but established, founded. By connecting the participle with &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the founding is designated as a permanent one. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, upon (not at) the top of the mountains, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-13.htm">1 Samuel 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; whereas such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a> are of a different character, and have no bearing upon the point. The temple mountain, or Zion, will be so exalted above all the mountains and hills, that it will appear to be founded upon the top of the mountains. This exaltation is of course not a physical one, as Hofmann, Drechsler, and several of the Rabbins suppose, but a spiritual (ethical) elevation above all the mountains. This is obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, according to which Zion will tower above all the mountains, because the law of the Lord issues from it. The assumption of a physical elevation cannot be established from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, for in the visions described in both these passages the earthly elevation is a symbol of a spiritual one. "Through a new revelation of the Lord, which is made upon it, and which leaves the older revelations far behind, whether made upon Sinai or upon itself, Zion becomes the greatest and loftiest mountain in the world" (Caspari), and the mountain seen from afar, to which "nations" stream, and not merely the one nation of Israel.<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is more precisely defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> as &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The attractive power which this mountain exerts upon the nations, so that they call upon one another to go up to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), does not reside in its height, which towers above that of all other mountains, but in the fact that the house of the God of Jacob stands upon it, i.e., that Jehovah is enthroned there, and teacher how to walk in His ways. &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, to teach out of the ways, so that the ways of God form the material from which they derive continual instruction. The desire for salvation, therefore, is the motive which prompts them to this pilgrimage; for they desire instruction in the ways of the Lord, that they may walk in them. The ways of Jehovah are the ways which God takes in His dealing with men, and by which men are led by Him; in reality, therefore, the ordinances of salvation which He has revealed in His word, the knowledge and observance of which secure life and blessedness. The words "for the law goes forth from Zion," etc., are words spoken not by the nations, but by the prophet, and assign the reason why the heathen go with such zeal to the mountain of Jehovah. The accent is laid upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (from Zion), which stands at the head, and &#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; (from Jerusalem), which is parallel to it. Thence does to&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., instruction in the ways of God, proceed, - in other words, the law as the rule of a godly life, and debhar Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the word of Jehovah), or the word of revelation as the source of salvation. It is evident from this that the mountain of the house of God is not thought of here as the place of worship, but as the scene of divine revelation, the centre of the kingdom of God. Zion is the source of the law and word of the Lord, from which the nations draw instruction how to walk in the ways of God, to make it their own, take it to their homes, and walk according to it. The fruit of this adoption of the word of the Lord will be, that they will not longer fight out their disputes with weapons of war, but let Jehovah judge and settle them, and thus acknowledge Him as their King and Judge. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; signifies to act as judge; &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; (lit., to set right), to settle and put a stop to a dispute. "Many nations," in contrast with the one nation, which formerly was alone in acknowledge Jehovah as its King and Judge. This is strengthened still further by the parallel "strong, mighty nations afar off." In consequence of this they will turn their weapons into instruments of peaceful agriculture, and wage no more war; in fact, they will learn war no more, no longer exercise themselves in the use of arms. For the words &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, where the summons to the nations to a decisive conflict with the kingdom of God is described as turning the instruments of agriculture into weapons of war. With the cessation of war, universal peace will ensue, and Israel will have no further enemies to fear, so that every one will have undisturbed enjoyment of the blessings of peace, of which Israel had had a foretaste during the peaceful reign of Solomon. The words "sit under his vine" are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), and &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; from the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. All this, however incredible it might appear, not only for the Israel of that time, but even now under the Christian dispensation, will assuredly take place, for the mouth of Jehovah the true God has spoken it. </body></html>
