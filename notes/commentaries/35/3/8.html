The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was the Lord displeased against the rivers? - The prophet asks the question thrice, as to the two miracles of the dividing of the Red Sea and the Jordan River, thereby the more earnestly declaring, that God meant somewhat by these acts and beyond them. He asks, as Daniel Dan 7:16. and Zechariah asked, what was the truth of the things which they saw. God's defilings with His former people were as much ensamples of what should be with us <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>. as the visions shown to the prophets. Hereafter too, there shall be <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-25.htm">Luke 21:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/8-6.htm">Revelation 8:6</a> "signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring;" there shall be deepening plagues upon the sea and the rivers and fountains of waters; and every living soul in the sea shall die <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-3.htm">Revelation 16:3</a>. But God's purpose therein aforetime was not as to the sea or the rivers, but for the salvation of His elect; so shall it be to the end. Mighty as may be the "mighty waves of the sea" which lift themselves up against the Lord, "mightier on high is the Lord" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/93-4.htm">Psalm 93:4</a>. Jerome: "As Thou didst dry up the Jordan and the Red Sea, fighting for us; for Thou wert not wroth with the rivers or the sea, nor could things without sense offend Thee; so now mounting Thy chariots, and taking Thy bow, Thou wilt give salvation to Thy people; and the oaths which Thou swarest to our fathers and the tribes, Thou wilt fulfill forever."<p>Thou didst ride upon Thy horses - as though God set His army <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/103-12.htm">Psalm 103:12</a>. "the Hosts which do His pleasure," against the armies of earth, as the prophet's servant had his eyes opened to see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-15.htm">2 Kings 6:15</a>. "the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha." Jerome: "Yet amidst so many thousands of horses and chariots, there was no rider; He was the Rider and Ruler of those horses, of whom the Psalmist says <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-1.htm">Psalm 80:1</a>. 'Thou that sittest above the Cherubim, shew Thyself.' With such horses and such chariots was Elijah also taken up into Heaven."<p>And Thy chariots of salvation - literally "Thy chariots are salvation." Not, as in human armies, except as far as they are the armies of God, to destruction. The end of God's armies, His visitations and judgments, is the salvation of His elect, even while they who are inwardly dead, perish outwardly also. Nor, again, do they prepare for the deliverance for which He intends them. With God, to will is to do. His chariots are salvation. His help is present help. His chariots are the tokens and channels of His Presence to aid. And so, they who bore His "Name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel, chosen vessels" to bear it, are, in a yet fuller sense, His chariots, which are salvation. Jerome said that they "are holy souls, upon which the word of God cometh, to save them and others by them Sol 1:9.. 'I have compared thee,' saith the Spouse, 'to a company of horses in Pharaoh's chariots.' However holy the soul, yet compared to God, it is like the chariot of Pharaoh; and a beast, yet still a beast, before Thee." <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-23.htm">Psalm 73:23</a>.. Yet such an one, as endowed with might and ready obedience, and swiftness and nobleness to bear the Word of God, and through His might whom they bore, not their own, nor making it their own, bearing down everything which opposed itself.<p>Cyril: "The object of the prophet, is to show that the second dispensation is better and more glorious, and of incomparably better things than the old. For of old He led Israel forth, through the bodily service of Moses, changing into blood the rivers of Egypt, and doing signs and wonders; then dividing the Red Sea, and carrying over the redeemed, and choking in the waters the most warlike of the Egyptians. But when the only-begotten Word of God became Man, He withdrew the whole human race under heaven from the tyranny of Satan, not changing rivers into blood, nor pouring forth His anger upon waters, nor dividing waves of the sea, nor bringing destruction upon people, but rather destroying the murderous Serpent himself, and taking away the sin which had been invented by him and for him, and loosing the unconquered might of death, and calling all to the knowledge of God, through the holy apostles, who, running forth their course under the whole heaven and bearing about the name of Christ, were very rightly had in admiration.<p>He saith then, O Lord, most worthy to be heard are those things, of which Thou hast Thyself been the Doer, and what Thou hast done anew is far better than what Thou didst through Moses. For Thou wilt not inflict wrath on rivers, nor show Thy might on the sea; not in these things will Thy divine and marvelous power gleam forth, but 'Thou wilt ride upon Thy horses,' and 'Thy chariots are Salvation.' What may these horses be? The blessed disciples, apostles and evangelists, they who took on them wholly the yoke of all His divine will, they, the noble, the obedient, ready for all things, whatsoever should please Him; who had Christ to sit upon them, whereof one is the blessed Paul, of whom Himself saith, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> : 'He is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My Name before the Gentiles.' Of fiery speed were these Horses, encompassing the whole earth; so then the chariots of God are said to be 'ten thousand times ten thousand' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-17.htm">Psalm 68:17</a>. For countless, each in their times, and after them, became leaders of the people, and subjected the neck of the understanding to the yoke of the Saviour, and bare about His glory throughout the whole earth, and rightly divided the word of truth, and subdued the whole earth, as with the speed of horsemen."<p>His chariots are salvation - Cyril: "for they ran not in vain, but to save cities and countries and nations together, Christ overthrowing the empires of devils, who, so to speak, divided among themselves the whole earth, subduing its dwellers to their own will." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?&#8212;"Was the cause of His dividing the Red Sea and Jordan His displeasure against these waters?" The answer to this is tacitly implied in "Thy chariots of salvation." "Nay; it was not displeasure against the waters, but His pleasure in interposing for His people's salvation" (compare Hab 3:10).<p>thy chariots&#8212;in antithesis to Thy foe, Pharaoh's chariots," which, notwithstanding their power and numbers, were engulfed in the waters of destruction. God can make the most unlikely means work for His people's salvation (Ex 14:7, 9, 23, 25-28; 15:3-8, 19). Jehovah's chariots are His angels (Ps 68:17), or the cherubim, or the ark (Jos 3:13; 4:7; compare So 1:9).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet recalls to memory the miraculous dividing of the Red Sea and Jordan, when God divided them to make a passage for his people, when by a miracle he made the devouring element to be a safeguard to his people, when it was not displeasure against the sea or the river, but favour to Israel, that moved him to do this. The prophet repeats the question, to impress the mind of the captive Jews with deeper apprehensions of the mercy of their God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The rivers:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm" title="He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.">Nahum 1:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sea; </span> the Red Sea. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Didst ride, </span> as a general at the head of his army, leading them forward on some great exploit.

Such sudden transitions are not uncommon (camp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-12.htm">Judges 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-19.htm">Psalm 78:19</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Was the Lord displeased against the rivers?</span> <span class="accented">Was it against the rivers, O Jehovah? was thy wrath kindled against the rivers?</span> Was God angry with inanimate nature, when he showed his power, for instance, in the Nile and the Jordan and the Red Sea?

"In that day, is the saying of Jehovah, will I assemble that which limps, and gather together that which has been thrust out, and which I have afflicted. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>. And I will make that which limps into a remnant, and that which is far removed into a strong nation; and Jehovah will rule over them from henceforth, even for ever." "In that day" points back to the end of the days in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>. At the time when many nations shall go on pilgrimage to the highly exalted mountain of the Lord, and therefore Zion-Jerusalem will not only be restored, but greatly glorified, the Lord will assemble that which limps and is scattered abroad. The feminines &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1500;&#1506;&#1492; and &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; are neuters, and to be understood collectively. Limping denotes the miserable condition into which the dispersed have been brought (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-15.htm">Psalm 35:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/38-18.htm">Psalm 38:18</a>). And this misery is inflicted by God. The limping and dispersed are those whom Jehovah has afflicted, whom He has punished for their sins. The gathering together of the nation has already been promised in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>; but there the assembling of all Israel was foretold, whereas here it is merely the assembling of the miserable, and of those who are scattered far and wide. There is no discrepancy in these two promises. The difference may easily be explained from the different tendencies of the two addressed. "All Jacob" referred to the two separate kingdoms into which the nation was divided in the time of the prophet, viz., Israel and Judah, and it was distinctly mentioned there, because the banishment of both had been foretold. This antithesis falls into the background here; and, on the other hand, prominence is given, in connection with what precedes, to the idea of happiness in the enjoyment of the blessings of the holy land. The gathering together involves reinstatement in the possession and enjoyment of these blessings. Hence only the miserable and dispersed are mentioned, to express the thought that no one is to be excluded from the salvation which the Lord will bestow upon His people in the future, though now he may be pining in the misery of the exile inflicted upon them. But just as the whole of the nation of Israel to be gathered together, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>, consists of the remnant of the nation only, so does the gathering together referred to here point only to the restoration of the remnant, which is to become a strong nation, over which Jehovah reigns as King in Zion. &#1502;&#1500;&#1498; is emphatic, expressing the setting up of the perfected monarchy, as it has never yet existed, either in the present or the past.<p>(Note: "Micah does not mention the descendants of David here, but Jehovah Himself, not to exclude the kingdom of David, but to show that God will prove that He was the author of that kingdom, and that all the power is His. For although God governed the ancient people by the hand of David, and by the hand of Josiah and Hezekiah, yet there was as it were a cloud interposed, so that God then reigned obscurely. The prophet therefore indicates a certain difference here between that shadowy kingdom and the new kingdom which God will openly manifest at the advent of the Messiah." - Calvin.)<p>This dominion will never be interrupted again, as it formerly was, by the banishment of the nation into exile on account of its sins, but will endure &#1502;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; (henceforth), i.e., from the future, which is regarded as present, even for ever.<p>So far as the realization of this exceedingly glorious promise is concerned, the expression standing at the head, be'acha&#774;r&#305;&#772;th hayya&#770;m&#305;&#772;m (at the end of the days), already points to the Messianic times: and the substance of the promise itself points to the times of the completion of the Messianic kingdom, i.e., to the establishment of the kingdom of glory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm">Matthew 19:28</a>). The temple mountain is a type of the kingdom of God in its New Testament form, which is described by all the prophets after the forms of the Old Testament kingdom of God. Accordingly, the going of the nations to the mountain of the house of Jehovah is, as a matter of fact, the entrance of the heathen who have been brought to the faith into the kingdom of Christ. This commenced with the spread of the gospel among the Gentiles, and has been continued through all the ages of the Christian church. But however many nations have hitherto entered into the Christian church, the time has not yet come for them to be so entirely pervaded with the spirit of Christ, as to allow their disputes to be settled by the Lord as their King, or to renounce war, and live in everlasting peace. Even for Israel the time has not yet come for the limping and exiled to be gathered together and made into a strong nation, however many individual Jews have already found salvation and peace within the bosom of the Christian church. The cessation of war and establishment of eternal peace can only take place after the destruction of all the ungodly powers on earth, at the return of Christ to judgment and for the perfecting of His kingdom. But even then, when, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-25.htm">Romans 11:25</a>., the pleroma of the Gentiles shall have entered into the kingdom of God, and Israel as a nation (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x399;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bb;  equals  &#1497;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-12.htm">Micah 2:12</a>) shall have turned to its Redeemer, and shall be assembled or saved, no physical elevation of the mountain of Zion will ensue, nor any restoration of the temple in Jerusalem, or return of the dispersed of Israel to Palestine. The kingdom of glory will be set up on the new earth, in the Jerusalem which was shown to the holy seer on Patmos in the Spirit, on a great and lofty mountain (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>). In this holy city of God there will be no temple, "for the Lord, the Almighty God, and the Lamb, are the temple thereof" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/21-22.htm">Revelation 21:22</a>). The word of the Lord to the Samaritan woman concerning the time when men would neither worship God on this mountain, nor yet in Jerusalem, but worship Him in spirit and in truth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-23.htm">John 4:23</a>), applies not only to the kingdom of God in its temporal development into the Christian church, but also to the time of the completion of the kingdom of God in glory. </body></html>
