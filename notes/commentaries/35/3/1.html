It is impossible to give the English reader an idea of the rhythmical structure of this beautiful composition. We will only observe that it is independent of the arrangement in verses, and that the poem (except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/habakkuk/3-7.htm" title="I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of the land of Midian did tremble.">Habakkuk 3:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-13.htm" title="You went forth for the salvation of your people, even for salvation with your anointed; you wounded the head out of the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation to the neck.

The "prayer" of the prophet, in the strictest sense of the word, is contained in the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-2.htm">Habakkuk 3:2</a>. The rest is, in its form, praise and thanksgiving, chiefly for God's past mercies in the deliverance from Egypt and the entering into the promised land. But thanksgiving is an essential part of prayer, and Hannah is said to have "prayed," whereas the hymn which followed is throughout one thanksgiving . In that also these former deliverances were images of things to come, of every deliverance afterward, and, especially, of that complete divine deliverance which our Lord Jesus Christ performed for us from the power of Satan <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>, the whole is one prayer: "Do, O Lord, as Thou hast done of old; forsake not Thine own works. Such were Thy deeds once; fulfill them now, all which they shadowed forth." It is then a prayer for the manifestation of God's power, and therewith the destruction of His enemies, thenceforth to the Day of Judgment. Cyril: "Having completed the discourse about Babylon, and having fore-announced most clearly, that those who destroyed the holy city and carried Israel captive shall be severely punished, he passes suitably to the mystery of Christ, and from the redemption which took place partially in one nation, he carries on the discourse to that universal redemption, whereby the remnant of Israel, and no less the whole world has been saved."<p>Upon Shigionoth - The title, "Shiggaion," occurs only once besides <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/7.htm">Psalm 7</a>. Upon, in the titles of the Psalms, is used with the instrument , the melody , or the first words of the hymn, whose melody has been adopted  The two first are mentioned by a Jewish Commentator (Tanchum) with others, "in his delight," or "his errors," in the sense, that God will forgive them. This, which the versions and Jewish commentators mostly adopt, would be a good sense, but is hardly consistent with the Hebrew usage. "Shiggaion of David," as a title of a Psalm, must necessarily describe the Psalm itself, as "Mismor of David," "Michtam of David," "Tephillah of David," "Maschil of David." But "Shiggaion," as a "great error," is not a title: nor does it suit the character of the Psalm, which relates to calumny not to error.<p>It probably, then, means a psalm with music expressive of strong emotion, "erratic" or "dithyrambic." Habakkuk's title, on Shigionoth (plural) then would mean upon, or (as we should say,) "set to" music of psalms of this sort  The number "three" remarkably predominates in this psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-6.htm">Habakkuk 3:6</a> has 15 words, in five combinations of three words; <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-10.htm">Habakkuk 3:10</a> have 12 words, in four 3's: <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-4.htm">Habakkuk 3:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-9.htm">Habakkuk 3:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a> have 9 words in three 3's: <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-5.htm">Habakkuk 3:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-12.htm">Habakkuk 3:12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-15.htm">Habakkuk 3:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-18.htm">Habakkuk 3:18</a> have 6 words in two 3's: <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-17.htm">Habakkuk 3:17</a> is divided into 4-3-3-4-3-3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-8.htm">Habakkuk 3:8</a> is 3-3-3-3-2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a> is 4-3-3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-16.htm">Habakkuk 3:16</a> is 3-3-3-2-2-2-3.

Habakkuk's Prayer to God: God's Glorious Revelation of Himself at Sinai and at Gibeon, a Pledge of His Interposing Again in Behalf of Israel against Babylon, and All Other Foes; Hence the Prophet's Confidence Amid Calamities.<p>This sublime ode begins with an exordium (Hab 3:1, 2), then follows the main subject, then the peroration (Hab 3:16-19), a summary of the practical truth, which the whole is designed to teach. (De 33:2-5; Ps 77:13-20 are parallel odes). This was probably designed by the Spirit to be a fit formula of prayer for the people, first in their Babylonian exile, and now in their dispersion, especially towards the close of it, just before the great Deliverer is to interpose for them. It was used in public worship, as the musical term, "Selah!" (Hab 3:3, 9, 13), implies.<p>1. prayer&#8212;the only strictly called prayers are in Hab 3:2. But all devotional addresses to God are called "prayers" (Ps 72:20). The Hebrew is from a root "to apply to a judge for a favorable decision." Prayers in which praises to God for deliverance, anticipated in the sure confidence of faith, are especially calculated to enlist Jehovah on His people's side (2Ch 20:20-22, 26).<p>upon Shigionoth&#8212;a musical phrase, "after the manner of elegies," or mournful odes, from an Arabic root [Lee]; the phrase is singular in Ps 7:1, title. More simply, from a Hebrew root to "err," "on account of sins of ignorance." Habakkuk thus teaches his countrymen to confess not only their more grievous sins, but also their errors and negligences, into which they were especially likely to fall when in exile away from the Holy Land [Calvin]. So Vulgate and Aquila, and Symmachus. "For voluntary transgressors" [Jerome]. Probably the subject would regulate the kind of music. Delitzsch and Henderson translate, "With triumphal music," from the same root "to err," implying its enthusiastic irregularity.Habakkuk’s prayer, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-1.htm" title="A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet on Shigionoth.">Habakkuk 3:1</a>,2</span>.

Of the name, character, and office of the prophet; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-1.htm">Habakkuk 1:1</a>. This chapter is entitled a "prayer" of his, a supplicatory one, put up in an humble and earnest manner, and in the exercise of faith, and under the influence of a spirit of prophecy. He before had a vision of the coming of Christ, and of what enemies would rise up, and obstruct his kingdom and interest in the world; and here lie prays that these obstructions might be removed, and that the kingdom of Christ, in its full extent and glory, might take place in the world; and is a prayer of faith, as he prayed it might be, he believed it would be; and left this prayer behind him, for the use and instruction of the church in all ages, until the whole should be accomplished. It seems to be composed after the manner of the psalms of David, to make it the more pleasant and agreeable; and that it might be the more regarded, and be more fitted for the public use and service of the sanctuary: this appears from the style of it, which is poetical, lofty, and sublime; from the frequent use of the word "Selah", peculiar to the psalms of David, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-3.htm">Habakkuk 3:3</a> and from the direction of it to the chief singer on the stringed instruments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-19.htm">Habakkuk 3:19</a> and from the phrase "upon", or "according to Shigionoth" here, which the Septuagint version renders "with a song"; and so the Arabic version, "after the manner of a song"; for this word seems to be the plural of Shiggaion, the title of the seventh psalm Psa 7:1; which was either the name, title, or first word of some song or songs, according to which this was to be sung; or the name of the tune with which it was to be sung; or of the instrument on which was to be sung: it very probably designs, and may called, an "erratic" or "wandering" song, because of the variableness of its metre, and of its tune. The Vulgate Latin version wrongly interprets it, "for ignorances"; as if this was a prayer of the prophet's for the pardon sins of error and ignorance committed by himself, or by others, or both; which sense is favoured by the Targum, <p>"a prayer which Habakkuk the prophet prayed, when it was revealed unto him concerning the length (of time) which (God) gave to the wicked; that, if they would return to the law with a perfect heart, they should be forgiven all the sins which they had committed before him as ignorance:'' <p>but there does not appear throughout the whole prayer one single petition for the pardon of any sin at all. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> upon Shigionoth.</span><p>(a) upon Shigionoth or for the ignorance.

The Revised Version gives, "set to Shigionoth;" and the expression is best explained to mean, in an impassioned or triumphal strain, with rapid change of emotion, a dithy rambic song - a description which admirably suits this ode. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Therefore will Zion for your sake be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem become stone heaps, and the mountain of the house become forest heights." La&#770;khe&#772;n (therefore) applies primarily to <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>, directing the threat of punishment by &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1500;&#1500;&#1499;&#1501; to all the sinners mentioned there; but it also points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>, expressing what is there indicated by "this." Zion is not "the site on which the city stood," or Jerusalem, "the mass of houses in the city," as Maurer and Caspari suppose; but Zion is that portion of the city which contained the royal palace, and Jerusalem the rest of the city (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-8.htm">Micah 4:8</a>). The mountain of the house, i.e., the temple hill, is also specially mentioned, for the purpose of destroying all false trust in the temple (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>). The predicates are divided rhetorically, and the thought is this: the royal palace, the city, and the temple shall be so utterly destroyed, that of all the houses and palaces only heaps of rubbish will remain, and the ground upon which the city stood will be partly used as a ploughed field, and partly overgrown with bushes (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-13.htm">Isaiah 32:13-14</a>). On sa&#770;deh as an accusative of effect (as a field  equals  becoming a field), see Ewald, 281, e; and for the plural form &#1506;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503;, see Ewald, 177, a. Habbayith (the house) is probably chosen intentionally instead of be&#772;th Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the house of Jehovah), because the temple ceased to be the dwelling-place of Jehovah as soon as it was destroyed. Hence in Ezekiel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-18.htm">Ezekiel 10:18</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>.) the Schechinah departs before the Babylonians destroy it. With regard to the fulfilment of this threat, see the points discussed at <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. </body></html>
