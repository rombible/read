The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>and His brightness - that wherein God dwelleth <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-4.htm">Ezekiel 10:4</a>, "the brightness of the Lord's glory," before which darkness fleeth <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18-12.htm">Psalm 18:12</a>, "was as the light," or as the sun. Out of the midst of the darkness, wherewith God, as it were <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-9.htm">Exodus 19:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-21.htm">Exodus 20:21</a>, hid Himself, the brightness of the "inapproachable Light" wherein "He dwelleth," gleams forth <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-10.htm">Exodus 24:10</a>, bright as the brightest "light" gathered into one, which man knows of and whereon he cannot gaze. So amid the darkness of the humiliation of His presence in the flesh, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a> : "We beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father;" and, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, "the people that walked in darkness see a great light," not dim. Theoph.: "nor weak, nor shadowed, like that of Moses, but pure unimaginable light of the knowledge of God." The brightness too of His flesh was like the light of the Godhead on Mount Tabor; for the Godhead flashed through. Rup.: "As often as He did His marvelous works, He put forth His "brightness" (tempered for His creatures, since they could not approach the depth of His light, yet) as "light" to enlighten people to know Him. Yet the brightness issues from the Light, co-existing with it, and in it, while issuing from it. And so the words aptly express, how He who is the, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>, "brightness of the Father's Glory and the express Image of His Person." Wisdom <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-25.htm">Hebrews 7:25</a>, "brightness of the eternal light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of His goodness," is as the Light from whom He is. Nicene Creed: "Light of Light," Equal to the Father by whom He was begotten. As John says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a> : "That was the true Light, which lighteneth every man that cometh into the world." As He prayeth in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>, "Glorify thou me with thine own self with the glory which I had with Thee before the world was."<p>He had horns coming out of His Hand - Jerome Dion: "Horns are everywhere in Holy Scripture the emblem of strength." It may be, that here "rays" are likened to horns, as the face of Moses is said, with the same image, to have "sent forth rays" after he had long been in the presence of God. So it may be a mingled image of the Glory and might; Light, which was also might. But "horns," though they may be a symbol of "light," are not of "lightning;" and the Hand of God is used as an emblem of His power, His protection, His bounty, His constraining force on His prophets. It is nowhere used of the side or sides. We have two images combined here; "horns" which in every other place in which they are used as a metaphor, is an emblem of power; and "from the hand of" which, wherever it is used of a person, means that the thing spoken of had been in his hand or power really or virtually. Both then combine in the meaning that the might came forth from the directing agency of God who wielded it.<p>When then did light or might, which lay, as it were, before in the hand of God, go forth from it? For "the hand of God" is always symbolic of His might, whether put forth, or for the time laid up in it. The form of the words remarkably corresponds to those of Moses, in the preface to the blessing on the tribes, which Habakkuk had in mind <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, "From His right hand was a fiery law for them," and Paul says that the glory of Moses' face which he received from the Presence of God, was a symbol of the glory of the law. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-7.htm">2 Corinthians 3:7</a> says, "The ministration of death written and engraven on stone was glorious, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance." The law, being given by God, had a majesty of its own. The Psalms bear witness to its power in converting, enwisening, rejoicing, enlightening the soul <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-8.htm">Psalm 19:8</a>. They in whose heart it was, none of their steps slipped <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-31.htm">Psalm 37:31</a>. The whole 119th Psalm is one varied testimony of its greatness and its power. It was a guide on the way; it was a schoolmaster unto Christ <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/3-24.htm">Galatians 3:24</a>, by whom it was fulfilled. But itself bare witness of the greater glory which should come forth from the Hand of God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-11.htm">2 Corinthians 3:11</a> states, "If that which is done away were glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious." Cyril: "The horn signifieth power, when it is spoken of God the Father exhibiting to us God the Son, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-69.htm">Luke 2:69</a>, 'He hath raised up a horn of salvation for us,' and again, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/111-9.htm">Psalm 111:9</a>, 'His horn shall be exalted in honor.' For all things which were marvelously done were glorious. The only-begotten One then came in our form, and, in regard to the flesh and the manhood, enduring the appearance of our weakness, but, as God, invisible in might and easily subduing whom He willed."<p>And what has been the weapon of His warfare, whereby He has subdued the might of Satan and the hearts of people, but "the horns" of His cross, whereto His sacred hands were once fastened by the sharp nails, where was the "hiding of His Power," when His almightiness lay hid in His passion <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-3.htm">Isaiah 53:3</a>, and He was <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-6.htm">Psalm 22:6</a> "a worm and no man; a reproach of men and the despised of the people?" Now it is the scepter laid upon His shoulder <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>, the ensign and trophy of His rule, the rod of His strength <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-2.htm">Psalm 110:2</a>, terrible to devils, salvation to mankind. In it lay His might, although concealed, as He said, "The words, horns are in His hands, show the insignia of His kingdom, by which horns, pushing and thrusting the invisible and opposing powers, He drove them away." Eusebius Dem. Evang. vi. 15. Add Cyprian Test. ad Quirin. ii. 21. p. 57. Oxford Translation: "The horns in His hands, what are they but the trophy of the cross?"<p>Augustine, de Civ. Dei xviii. 32), "I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto Me" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-32.htm">John 12:32</a>. His Might was lodged there, although hidden. It was "the hiding-place of His power." The cross was, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23-24</a>, "to the Jews a stumbling-block, and unto the Greeks foolishness; but unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ crucified was the Power of God and the Wisdom of God." Through the Cross was, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, "all power given to Him both in Heaven and earth." <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-14.htm">Daniel 7:14</a> : "there was given Him dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages should serve Him." From Him shall go forth all power in earth; by His hands shall be given the vacant thrones in Heaven, as He says in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-21.htm">Revelation 3:21</a>, "To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with Me in My Throne, even as I also overcame and am set down with My Father in His Throne." There too was the hiding of His Power, in that there, in His Cross, is our shelter , and in His pierced Side our hiding place, where we may take refuge from Satan and our sins; for therein is power.<p>Consider <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-28.htm">John 10:28</a>, "Neither shall any pluck them out of My Hand." Light and darkness always meet in God. His inapproachable light is darkness to eyes which would gaze on it. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm">Psalm 104:2</a>, "he covereth Himself with Light as with a garmemt." His light is the very veil which hideth Him. His Light is darkness to those who pry into Him and His Nature; His darkness is light to those who by faith behold Him. He "emptied Himself" <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a> and hid Himself; He hid the power of His Godhead in the weakness of the Manhood, and so, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>, "He who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, hath shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the Face of Jesus Christ." Jerome: "In the Cross was for a while His might hidden, when He said to His Father, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-38.htm">Matthew 26:38-39</a>, 'My soul is exceeding sorrowful even unto death, and, Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from Me,' and on the Cross itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-13.htm">Luke 23:13</a>, 'Father, into Thy Hands I commend My Spirit.

"Rays" emanating from "His hand," compared by the Arabs to the horns of the gazelle (compare "hind of the morning," Ps 22:1, title, Margin). The Hebrew verb for to "emit rays," is from the root meaning "horns" (Ex 34:29, 30, 35) [Grotius]. The rays are His lightnings (Ps 18:8), [Maurer].<p>there&#8212;in that "brightness." In it, notwithstanding its brilliancy, there was but the veil "(the hiding) of His power." Even "light," God's "garment," covers, instead of revealing fully, His surpassing glory (Ps 104:2) [Henderson]. Or, on Mount Sinai [Drusius]. (Compare Ex 24:17). The Septuagint and Syriac versions read for "there," He made a hiding, &c.; He hid Himself with clouds. English Version is better, which Calvin explains, there is said to be "a hiding of God's power," because God did not reveal it indiscriminately to all, but specially to His people (Ps 31:20). The contrast seems to me to be between the "horns" or emanations out of His power ("hand"), and that "power" itself. The latter was hidden, whereas the "horns" or emanations alone were manifested. If the mere scintillations were so awfully overwhelming, how much more so the hidden power itself! This was especially true of His manifestation at Sinai (Ps 18:11; compare Isa 45:15, 17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">His brightness, </span> that lustre in which God appeared, that unparalleled splendour which shined from him, was as the light; pure, clear as the sun, but much more dazzling and overcoming. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Horns:</span> some read it beams or rays of light, and so the Hebrew will bear, and thus it is plain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of his hand:</span> our God is all glory and light; Moses’s face shined; the face, yea hands, of our God shine with glorious light; he dwelleth in light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There; </span> either in that place where he thus appeared, or in that light wherewith he appeared· <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was the hiding of his power:</span> one would think his brightness should have discovered, not hid his power; it did both, it discovered much of it, but hid much more; it was light inaccessible, and therefore a hiding light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Power; </span> strength or might: by what was there done it did evidently appear, God, who was there, could do much more, but it could not appear how much he could do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">His brightness, </span> that lustre in which God appeared, that unparalleled splendour which shined from him, was as the light; pure, clear as the sun, but much more dazzling and overcoming. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Horns:</span> some read it beams or rays of light, and so the Hebrew will bear, and thus it is plain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Out of his hand:</span> our God is all glory and light; Moses’s face shined; the face, yea hands, of our God shine with glorious light; he dwelleth in light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">There; </span> either in that place where he thus appeared, or in that light wherewith he appeared· <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Was the hiding of his power:</span> one would think his brightness should have discovered, not hid his power; it did both, it discovered much of it, but hid much more; it was light inaccessible, and therefore a hiding light. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Power; </span> strength or might: by what was there done it did evidently appear, God, who was there, could do much more, but it could not appear how much he could do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/habakkuk/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his brightness was as the light,.... Of fire, of devouring fire on the top of the mount, to which the sight of his glory was like, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-16.htm">Exodus 24:16</a> to which Kimchi refers it. Aben Ezra thinks the pillar of fire is intended, in which the Lord went before his people in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/13-21.htm">Exodus 13:21</a> or as the light and splendour of Bereshith, as the Targum, of that primogenital light which was produced on the first day of the creation; or as the light of the seven days of the creation, as Jarchi; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-26.htm">Isaiah 30:26</a> or rather as the light of the sun shining in its full strength, Christ being the light of the world, and the sun of righteousness; and so may describe him as the brightness of his Father's glory; or his glory, as the only begotten of the Father, seen by his own disciples in the days of his flesh, shining through his works and miracles; or as exhibited in the light of his glorious Gospel, which is the great light that shined on men; and in and by which they that sat in darkness saw light, and who were darkness itself were made light in the Lord: what a glory, lustre, brightness, and light, did the Gospel spread in the world at the first publication of it! <p>he had horns coming out of his hand; which the Jewish interpreters understand of Moses having horns or beams of light and glory from the hand and power of God, when he conversed with him on the mount, and the skin of his face shone, where the same word is used as here,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-29.htm">Exodus 34:29</a> though some of them interpret it of the two tables of the law, which came from the hand of the Lord, edged with glory and brightness, and looked like fire; hence called a "fiery law", <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>. The words may be rendered, as in the margin, "he had beams" coming "out of his side" (g); and be understood of Christ, who has beams and rays of glory on all sides of him, all around him; he is all glory (h); he is crowned with glory and honour, and highly exalted at his Father's right hand, above all principalities and powers: and "horns" being an emblem of power and might, authority and dominion, the phrase may denote that power and authority in heaven and in earth are given to him as Mediator, and exercised by him. Van Till observes, that the word "horn" is a military term, and is used for the wings of armies, the right and left; and as Christ is here described as a General of an army, marching forth in a warlike manner; these may denote the armies or companies under him, at his hand, and under his command, accoutred, and ready to obey his orders; and particularly may have respect to the division made among the apostles, whom he sent forth to subdue men to him; committing the Gospel of the circumcision to Peter, and of the uncircumcision to Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-7.htm">Galatians 2:7</a> whose ministrations were made successful to the pulling down of the strong holds of sin and Satan, and reducing many to the obedience of Christ: <p>and there was the hiding of his power; that is, in his hand; there his power, which before was hidden, was made manifest; and yet so little displayed, in comparison of what it is in itself, that it may be rather said to be hid than revealed; or there, in his hand, lies his power, with which he hides and covers his people in the day of battle; especially his ministering servants, whom he holds in his right hand, and preserves them amidst a thousand dangers and difficulties, and keeps them for further usefulness; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-10.htm">Acts 18:10</a>. The Targum is, <p>"sparks went out from the chariot of his glory; there he revealed his majesty, which was hid from the children of men, with sublime power.'' <p>Aben Ezra thinks the ark is meant by "the hiding of his power", called "the ark of his strength", <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-8.htm">Psalm 132:8</a>. <p>(g)   "e lateribus utrinque emicabant cornua", i. e.

In the original passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-2.htm">Deuteronomy 33:2</a>, we read, "At his right hand was a fiery Law unto them" - a reference to the two tables of stone, perhaps resplendent with light. The "hand" in our text is a general expression, and is not to be taken with any special reference to lightning launched by the hand (which is not a scriptural expression), nor to works effected by God's agency, but simply as signifying that the light of his presence streamed forth from both sides, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> everywhere. <span class="cmt_word">There was the hiding of his power.</span> There, in that ineffable light, was the hiding place of his majesty.

"And it comes to pass at the end of the days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house will be established on the head of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and nations stream to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>. And many nations go, and say, Up, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways, and we may walk in His paths: for from Zion will law go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. And He will judge between many nations, and pronounce sentence on strong nations afar off; and they forge their swords into coulters, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>. And they will sit, every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it."<p>(Note: This promise is placed by Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) at the head of his prophecy of Zion's way through judgment from the false glory to the true. The originality of the passage in Micah is open to no question. Delitzsch acknowledges this, and has given the principal arguments in its favour in the Commentary on Isaiah. For still more elaborate proofs, see Caspari's Micha, pp. 444-5.)<p>By the phrase "at the end of the days," which always denotes the Messianic era when used by the prophets (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), the predicted exaltation of the temple mountain is assigned to the period of the completion of the kingdom of God. The mountain of the house of Jehovah is the temple mountain, strictly speaking, Moriah, as the distinction made between the mountain of the house and Zion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> clearly shows; but as a subordinate peak of Zion, it is embraced along with Zion in what follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>) as the seat of Jehovah's rule, from which the law proceeds. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean placed or set up, but established, founded. By connecting the participle with &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the founding is designated as a permanent one. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, upon (not at) the top of the mountains, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-13.htm">1 Samuel 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; whereas such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a> are of a different character, and have no bearing upon the point. The temple mountain, or Zion, will be so exalted above all the mountains and hills, that it will appear to be founded upon the top of the mountains. This exaltation is of course not a physical one, as Hofmann, Drechsler, and several of the Rabbins suppose, but a spiritual (ethical) elevation above all the mountains. This is obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, according to which Zion will tower above all the mountains, because the law of the Lord issues from it. The assumption of a physical elevation cannot be established from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, for in the visions described in both these passages the earthly elevation is a symbol of a spiritual one. "Through a new revelation of the Lord, which is made upon it, and which leaves the older revelations far behind, whether made upon Sinai or upon itself, Zion becomes the greatest and loftiest mountain in the world" (Caspari), and the mountain seen from afar, to which "nations" stream, and not merely the one nation of Israel.<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is more precisely defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> as &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The attractive power which this mountain exerts upon the nations, so that they call upon one another to go up to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), does not reside in its height, which towers above that of all other mountains, but in the fact that the house of the God of Jacob stands upon it, i.e., that Jehovah is enthroned there, and teacher how to walk in His ways. &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, to teach out of the ways, so that the ways of God form the material from which they derive continual instruction. The desire for salvation, therefore, is the motive which prompts them to this pilgrimage; for they desire instruction in the ways of the Lord, that they may walk in them. The ways of Jehovah are the ways which God takes in His dealing with men, and by which men are led by Him; in reality, therefore, the ordinances of salvation which He has revealed in His word, the knowledge and observance of which secure life and blessedness. The words "for the law goes forth from Zion," etc., are words spoken not by the nations, but by the prophet, and assign the reason why the heathen go with such zeal to the mountain of Jehovah. The accent is laid upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (from Zion), which stands at the head, and &#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; (from Jerusalem), which is parallel to it. Thence does to&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., instruction in the ways of God, proceed, - in other words, the law as the rule of a godly life, and debhar Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the word of Jehovah), or the word of revelation as the source of salvation. It is evident from this that the mountain of the house of God is not thought of here as the place of worship, but as the scene of divine revelation, the centre of the kingdom of God. Zion is the source of the law and word of the Lord, from which the nations draw instruction how to walk in the ways of God, to make it their own, take it to their homes, and walk according to it. The fruit of this adoption of the word of the Lord will be, that they will not longer fight out their disputes with weapons of war, but let Jehovah judge and settle them, and thus acknowledge Him as their King and Judge. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; signifies to act as judge; &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; (lit., to set right), to settle and put a stop to a dispute. "Many nations," in contrast with the one nation, which formerly was alone in acknowledge Jehovah as its King and Judge. This is strengthened still further by the parallel "strong, mighty nations afar off." In consequence of this they will turn their weapons into instruments of peaceful agriculture, and wage no more war; in fact, they will learn war no more, no longer exercise themselves in the use of arms. For the words &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, where the summons to the nations to a decisive conflict with the kingdom of God is described as turning the instruments of agriculture into weapons of war. With the cessation of war, universal peace will ensue, and Israel will have no further enemies to fear, so that every one will have undisturbed enjoyment of the blessings of peace, of which Israel had had a foretaste during the peaceful reign of Solomon. The words "sit under his vine" are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), and &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; from the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. All this, however incredible it might appear, not only for the Israel of that time, but even now under the Christian dispensation, will assuredly take place, for the mouth of Jehovah the true God has spoken it. </body></html>
