The petition “in wrath remember mercy,” is explained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a> <span class= "ital">et seq.</span> It implies—though Thy visitation be well deserved, yet mercifully limit its duration, as on former occasions.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/habakkuk/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-2.htm" title="O LORD, I have heard your speech, and was afraid: O LORD, revive your work in the middle of the years, in the middle of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.">Habakkuk 3:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">O Lord, I have heard thy speech and was afraid — </span>I have heard what thou hast revealed to me concerning thy judgments to be executed, first upon thy own people, and afterward upon their enemies the Chaldeans, and the terribleness of them hath filled me with a reverential awe and dread. <span class="ital">O Lord, revive, </span>or <span class="ital">preserve alive, thy work in the midst of the years — </span>Habakkuk having understood, by divine revelation, that some time would intervene between the desolation of Judea and the punishment of the Chaldeans, here entreats God, that, during that interval, he would preserve or take care of his work; that is, his Israel, that <span class="ital">work of his hands which he had formed for himself, </span>that they might <span class="ital">show forth his praise: </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-21.htm" title="This people have I formed for myself; they shall show forth my praise.">Isaiah 43:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-11.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker, Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning the work of my hands command you me.">Isaiah 45:11</a> :) together with the work of his grace in and among them; that he would keep that spark alive amidst the waters of tribulation and temptation through which they had to pass. Although all men are the work of God, yet the Jews might be called so more emphatically, because he had, by many extraordinary interpositions, raised them to be a peculiar people to himself, and had formed them such by laws given to them in a singular manner, not used with regard to any other people. <span class="ital">In the midst of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy</span> — Or, as Grotius interprets the clause, <span class="ital">In that intervening time show, that although thou art angry, thou rememberest mercy. </span>In the midst of these years of calamity let thy people experience, that even in thy indignation thou thinkest upon mercy, and dost not lay more upon them than thou enablest them to bear. The years here referred to seem plainly to be those in which the Jews were under the power of the Chaldeans, and Judea lay desolate. Mr. Green translates the verse, <span class="ital">O Jehovah, I have heard thy report: </span>(that is, what thou hast revealed concerning the captivity:) <span class="ital">I am in pain, O Jehovah, for thy work: </span>(that is, the Jewish people:) <span class="ital">in the midst of the years revive it: </span>(restore the Jews to their own land before the years appointed for their captivity are expired:) <span class="ital">in the midst of the years show compassion; in wrath remember mercy.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1,2 The word prayer seems used here for an act of devotion. The Lord would revive his work among the people in the midst of the years of adversity. This may be applied to every season when the church, or believers, suffer under afflictions and trials. Mercy is what we must flee to for refuge, and rely upon as our only plea. We must not say, Remember our merit, but, Lord, remember thy own mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, I have heard - i. e., with the inward ear of the heart, "Thy speech," (rather as English margin, Thy report, i. e., the report of Thee)  i. e., what may he heard and known of God, or, what he had himself heard . The word contains in one both what God had lately declared to the prophet, the judgments of God upon the wicked of the people, and upon those who, with their own injustice, done upon them the righteous judgments of God, and that the work of the Lord would be performed in His time for those who in patience wait for it; and also still more largely, what might be heard of God, although, as it were, but a little whisper of His greatness and of the majesty of His workings.<p>And was afraid - not "fearful" but "afraid in awe," as a creature, and amazed at the surpassing wonderfulness of the work of God. Well may man stand in awe  "at the incarnation of the only-begotten Son, how earth should contain Him uncontained by space, how a body was prepared for Him of the virgin by the Holy Spirit, and all the works whereby He shall work the salvation of mankind, the cross, the death, resurrection and ascension, uniting things opposite, a body with one incorporeal, death with life, resurrection with death, a body in heaven. All is full of wonder and awe." Rup.: "This is not a servile fear, but a holy fear which endureth forever, not one which 'love casteth out,' but which it bringeth in, wherein angels praise, dominions adore, powers stand in awe at the majesty of the Eternal God."<p>O Lord, revive Thy work - God's Word seems, often, as it were, dead and "come utterly to an end for evermore" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/77-8.htm">Psalm 77:8</a>, while it is holding on its own course, as all nature seems dead for a while, but all is laid up in store, and ready to shoot forth, as by a sort of resurrection Rup.: "The prophet prophesying prayeth, that it should come quickly, and praying prophesieth that it shall so come." All God's dealings with His people, His Church, each single soul, are part of one great work, perfect in itself <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-4.htm">Deuteronomy 32:4</a>; glory and majesty <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>; all which the godly meditateth on <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/77-3.htm">Psalm 77:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-5.htm">Psalm 143:5</a>; which those busied with their own plans, do not look to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; it is manifested in great doings for them or with them, as in the Exodus the Psalmist says, "We have heard with our ears, yea, our fathers have told us what work Thou didst in their days, in the times of old" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-2.htm">Psalm 44:2</a>; "They proved Me and saw My work" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm">Psalm 95:9</a>; with it He makes His own glad <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/92-3.htm">Psalm 92:3</a>; after it has been withdrawn for a while, "He sheweth it to His servants" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/90-6.htm">Psalm 90:6</a>; it issues in judgments on the ungodly, which people consider and declare .<p>The great work of God on earth, which includes all His works and is the end of all, is the salvation of man through Jesus Christ. This great work seemed, as it were, asleep, or dead, as trees in winter, all through those 4,000 years, which gave no token of His coming. Included in this great work is the special work of the Hand of God, of which alone it is said, "God said, Let Us make man in Our image after Our Likeness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; and, "we are the clay and Thou our Potter, and we are all the work of Thy Hands" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-8.htm">Isaiah 64:8</a>; and "Thy Hands have made me and fashioned me together round about" <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-8.htm">Job 10:8</a>, man; whom, being dead as to the life of the soul through the malice of Satan, Christ revived by dying and rising again. He was "dead in trespasses and sins," and like a carcass putrefying in them, and this whole world one great charnel-house, through man's manifold corruptions, when Christ came to awaken the dead, and they who heard lived <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-25.htm">John 5:25</a>.<p>Again, the Center of this work, the special Work of God, that wherein He made all things new, is the Human Body of our Lord, the Temple which was destroyed by death, and within three days was raised up.<p>The answer to Habakkuk's enquiry, "How long?" had two sides: It had given assurance as to the end. The trial-time would not be prolonged for one moment longer than the counsel of God had fore-determined. The relief would "come, come; it would not be behind-hand." But meantime? There was no comfort to be given. For God knew that deepening sin was drawing on deepening chastisement. But in that He was silent as to the intervening time and pointed to patient expectation of a lingering future, as their only comfort, He implies that the immediate future was heavy. Habakkuk then renews his prayer for the years which had to intervene and to pass away. "In the midst of the years," before that "time appointed" , when His promise should have its full fulfillment, before those years should come to their close, he prays; "revive Thy work." The years include all the long period of waiting for our Lord's first coming before He came in the Flesh; and now for His second coming and the "restitution of all things." in this long period, at times God seems to be absent, as when our Lord was asleep in the boat, while the tempest was raging; at times He bids "the storm to cease and there is a great calm."<p>This, in those long intervals, when God seems to be absent, and to leave all things to time and chance, and love waxes cold, and graces seem rare, is the prayer of Habakkuk, of prophets and Psalmists, of the Church <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/80-14.htm">Psalm 80:14</a>, "Return, we beseech Thee, O God of hosts, look down from heaven, behold and visit this vine <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm">Psalm 74:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11-12</a>. O God, why hast Thou cast us off forever? Why withdrawest Thou Thy hand, Thy right hand? For God is my king of old, working salvation in the midst of the earth. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-9.htm">Isaiah 51:9-10</a> awake, awake, put on strength, Thou Arm of the Lord; awake, as in the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not It which did smite Rahab, didst wound the dragon? Art thou not It which didst dry the sea, the waters of the great deep, which didst make the depths of the sea a way for the ransomed to pass over? <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-3.htm">Psalm 80:3</a>. Stir up Thy might and come, save us <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/5-21.htm">Lamentations 5:21</a>. Renew our days, as of old." So our Lord taught His Church to pray continually, whenever she prayed, "Thy kingdom come," longing not for His final coming only, but for the increase of His glory, and the greater dominion of His grace, and His enthronement in the hearts of people, even before its complete and final coming. "In the midst of the years revive Thy work," is the Church's continual cry.<p>In the midst of the years make known - literally, "Thou wilt make known: in wrath Thou wilt remember mercy;" and so (as we use the word "wilt") the prophet, at once, foretelleth, expresseth his faith, prayeth. God had made known His work and His power in the days of old. In times of trouble He seems "like a God who hideth Himself." Now, he prays Him to shine forth and help; make known Thy work, before Thou fulfill it, to revive the drooping hopes of man, and that all may see that "Thy word is truth." Make Thyself known in Thy work, that, when the time cometh to <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-24.htm">Daniel 9:24</a> "make an end of sin" by the Death of Thy Son, Thy Awful Holiness, and the love wherewith Thou hast <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-16.htm">John 3:16</a> "so loved the world," may be the more known and adored.<p>In wrath Thou wilt remember mercy - So David prayed <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/25-6.htm">Psalm 25:6</a>, "Remember Thy tender-mercies and Thy loving-kindnesses; for they are from old." "Thou wilt remember" that counsel for man's redemption which has been from the foundation of the world: for we seem in our own minds to be forgotten of God, when He delayeth to help us. God remembereth mercy <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-54.htm">Luke 1:54</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-72.htm">Luke 1:72</a> in anger, in that in this life He never chastens without purposes of mercy, and His Mercy ever softeneth His judgments. His Promise of mercy, that the Seed of the woman shall bruise the serpent's head, went before the sentence of displeasure <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>, "Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return." Jerome: "He reveals His wrath that He may scare us from sin and so may not inflict it;" and when at last He inflicteth it, He hath mercy on the remnant who flee to His Mercy, that we be not like Sodom and Gomorrah. <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-8.htm">Romans 5:8</a>, "while we were yet sinners," and God was angry, "Christ died for us," and, <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>, "He saved us, not for works which we had done, but out of His great Mercy," and took away sin, and restored us to life and interruption.<p>God had already promised by Micah M<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-15.htm">1 Corinthians 7:15</a>, "According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt, I will show him marvelous things." Isaiah had often used the great events of that deliverance as the symbols of the future. So now Habakkuk, in one vast panorama, as it were, without distinction of time or series of events, exhibits the future in pictures of the past. In the description itself which follows, he now speaks in the past, now in the future; of which times the future might be a vivid present; and the past a prophetic past. As a key to the whole, he says, "God shall come," indicating that all which follows, however spoken, was a part of that future. In no other way was it an answer to that prayer, "Revive Thy work." To foretell future deliverances in plain words, had been a comfort; it would have promised a continuance of that work. The unity and revival of the work is expressed, in that the past is made, as it was, the image of the future. That future was to be wondrous, superhuman; elsewhere the past miracles had been no image of it. It was to be no mere repetition of the future; and to mark this, the images are exhibited out of their historical order. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. I have heard thy speech&#8212;Thy revelation to me concerning the coming chastisement of the Jews [Calvin], and the destruction of their oppressors. This is Habakkuk's reply to God's communication [Grotius]. Maurer translates, "the report of Thy coming," literally, "Thy report."<p>and was afraid&#8212;reverential fear of God's judgments (Hab 3:16).<p>revive thy work&#8212;Perfect the work of delivering Thy people, and do not let Thy promise lie as if it were dead, but give it new life by performing it [Menochius]. Calvin explains "thy work" to be Israel; called "the work of My hands" (Isa 45:11). God's elect people are peculiarly His work (Isa 43:1), pre-eminently illustrating His power, wisdom, and goodness. "Though we seem, as it were, dead nationally, revive us" (Ps 85:6). However (Ps 64:9), where "the work of God" refers to His judgment on their enemies, favors the former view (Ps 90:16, 17; Isa 51:9, 10).<p>in the midst of the years&#8212;namely, of calamity in which we live. Now that our calamities are at their height; during our seventy years' captivity. Calvin more fancifully explains it, in the midst of the years of Thy people, extending from Abraham to Messiah; if they be cut off before His coming, they will be cut off as it were in the midst of their years, before attaining their maturity. So Bengel makes the midst of the years to be the middle point of the years of the world. There is a strikingly similar phrase (Da 9:27), In the midst of the week. The parallel clause, "in wrath" (that is, in the midst of wrath), however, shows that "in the midst of the years" means "in the years of our present exile and calamity."<p>make known&#8212;Made it (Thy work) known by experimental proof;

Or, "thy hearing" (p); which the Lord had caused to be heard from and of himself; the report that had been made to him, and other prophets before him, particularly Isaiah, who says, "who hath believed our report?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a> where the same phrase is used as here: though it seems here not so much to regard the evangelical part of that report, concerning the coming of Christ, his sufferings and death, in order obtain redemption and salvation for his people; for this would have been, and was, matter of joy, and not of fear and consternation: but the truth is this, the Lord in the preceding speech, being a report he made to the prophet concerning the Messiah, had signified that Christ would have many enemies from the Jews and from the Gentiles, from Rome Pagan and Rome Papal; that the church of Christ would meet with great afflictions and persecutions, and be attended with many conflicts, temptations, and difficulties; that the interest of the Redeemer would be sometimes very low, and the work of the Lord at a stand in the world, yea, seemingly dead, quite lost and gone; this is what caused the fear and distress in the prophet's mind, and gave him that pain and uneasiness: and hence the following petition, <p>O Lord, revive thy work in the midst of the years; which refers not to the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity, which was fixed to a term of years, when, and not before, not in the midst of them it would be wrought; but to the great work of the Lord in the times of the Gospel. There is a double reading of these words in the Septuagint version of them, and both very different from the Hebrew text. The one is, "in the midst of two lives thou shalt be known"; the life that now is, and that which is to come. The other, by a change of the accent, is, "in the midst of two animals thou shall be known"; so the Arabic version. Theodoret makes mention of both, and inclines to the former; <p>"some (he says) by two animals understand angels and men; some the incorporeal powers near the divine Glory, the cherubim and seraphim; others the Jews and Babylonians; but to me it seems that the prophet does not say animals, but lives, the present and future, in the midst of which he was a just Judge:'' <p>but the latter reading is followed by many of the ancients, whose different senses are given by Jerom on the place; some interpreting them of the Son and Spirit, by whom the Father is made known; others of the two cherubim in Exodus, and of the two seraphim in Isaiah; and there were some who understood them of the two Testaments, the Old and New, in the midst of which the Lord may be known; and others of Christ's being crucified between two thieves, by which be might be known: but, besides these different sentiments, many of the ancients concluded from hence that Christ lay in the manger between two animals, the ox and the ass, and to which they refer in their ancient hymns (q); but though this is a wrong version of the text, and a wrong sense which is put upon it, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>; yet, as Burkius observes, there is in this mistake a certain and ancient truth, that the text of Habakkuk belongs to the work of God in Christ, and especially to the nativity of our Lord Jesus; and so some later writers apply this to the wonderful work of the incarnation of Christ, that new, unheard of, and amazing thing the Lord would work in the earth; the promise of which, being delayed, might seem to be dead; and therefore it is entreated it might be revived, and the performance of it hastened; and others to the work of redemption by Christ, which the Father gave him to do, and he promised to come and perform; but, being deferred, the Old Testament saints were impatient of it. Cocceius and Van Till restrain it to the resurrection of Christ from the dead, his coming being prophesied of before; and render the words, "O Lord, thy work is his life (r), in the midst of the years"; the resurrection of Christ from the dead, or the quickening of him, is prophesied of in many places as a work that would be done, and in which the hope and expectation of the saints were placed; this being a work of great importance both to Christ, his exaltation and glory, and to his people; their quickening together with him; their regeneration, or passing from death to life; their justification of life, and resurrection from the dead, depending upon it; and this is the Lord's work, and owing to the exceeding greatness of his power, and is frequently ascribed to God the Father, who raised Christ from the dead, and gave him glory: and this was "in the midst of the years", or between the years of the Old and of the New Testament; the former was the year of God's longsuffering and forbearance, the time when the Jewish church, like children, were under governors and tutors, until the time appointed of the Father; the latter is the acceptable year of the Lord, and the year of the redeemed; and between these two years, at the end of the one, and the beginning of the other, the Messiah came, was cut off or died, and was quickened and raised again: but I should choose rather to understand this more generally of the work of the Lord in the Christian churches throughout the whole Gospel dispensation, or at least in some certain periods of it. The church itself is the work of the hands of the Lord, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-11.htm">Isaiah 45:11</a> which sometimes has seemed to have been in a very dead and lifeless state and condition, as in the dark times of Popery; and though there was a reviving of it upon the Reformation, yet there has been a decline since; and the Sardian church state, in which we now are, is described as having a "name", that it "lives", and yet is "dead"; and the interest of religion, and the church of Christ, will be lower still when the witnesses are slain, and their dead bodies lie unburied, before the Spirit of the Lord enters into them, and revives them: now the prophet having in view these various intervals, and especially the last, prays for a reviving of the interest and church of Christ, and the work of the Lord in it; and which will be done when Christ will come in a spiritual manner, and destroy antichrist; when the Spirit will be poured down plentifully from on high; when the Gospel will be purely and powerfully preached all over the world; when the ordinances of it will be administered as at the beginning; when multitudes of churches will be raised and formed, the Jews will be converted, and the fulness of the Gentiles brought in: this will be a reviving time indeed! and there never will be a thorough one till this time comes; and this will be in "the midst of the years"; between the years of the reign of antichrist, the 1260 days or years of it, which will now expire, and the thousand years of Christ's personal reign on earth; between these two will be this reviving time or spiritual reign of Christ (s). The words may to good purpose be applied to the work of grace in the hearts of true believers in Christ, which is the Lord's work, and his only; not men, not ministers, not angels, but Jehovah only is the author and finisher of it. This sometimes seems as it were to be dead, when the graces of the Spirit are not in exercise; when saints are in dead and lifeless frames of soul; when they are backward to spiritual and religious exercises; when the world, and the things of it, have got power over them, and they are unconcerned for the things of Christ, the honour of his name, and the good of their own souls; when they are under the power of some sin, and are carried captive by it, as was the case of David, Peter, and others: now this work is revived, when the graces of the Spirit are called forth again into lively exercise; when the affections go out strongly after divine objects and things; when the thoughts of the mind, and the meditations of the heart, are on spiritual subjects; when the talk and conversation turns chiefly on things of a religious and heavenly nature; when there is a forwardness to spiritual exercises, a stirring up of themselves and others to them, and a continuance in them; when there is a visible growing in grace, and a fruitfulness in every good work: this is to be prayed for, and is from the Lord; and is owing to his setting his hand a second time to the work; to his being as the dew to his people; to Christ the sun of righteousness arising on them, with healing in his wings; and to the south wind of the Spirit blowing upon them, and causing their spices to flow out; and this is desirable in the midst of their years, before the years come on in which they have no pleasure, or before they go hence, and be no more: <p>in the midst of the years make known; which Cocceius and Van Till restrain to the notification of Christ's resurrection from the dead by the ministry of the Gospel, for the benefit of the Lord's people, both Jews and Gentiles; as being a matter of great consequence to them, and for the confirmation of the Christian religion, as it undoubtedly was: but it seems better to understand it in a more general sense, that God would make known more of himself, as the covenant God and Father of his people, of his mind and will, of his love, grace, and mercy in Christ; that he would make known more of Christ, of his person, offices, and grace; that he would make known more clearly the work of his Spirit and grace upon their hearts, and display his power, and the efficacy of his grace, in reviving it, and carrying it on; that he would make known more largely his covenant and promises, his truth and faithfulness in the performance of them; that he would grant a larger measure of knowledge of all divine things of the Gospel, and the truths of it; such as is promised, and is expected will be in the latter day, when the earth shall be everywhere filled with the knowledge of the Lord, <a href="http://www.bibleapps.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm">Habakkuk 2:14</a>, <p>in wrath remember mercy; the above interpreters refer this to the time of God's wrath and vengeance upon the Jewish nation for their rejection of the Messiah; and which the prophet does not pray might be averted, but that mercy might be remembered to his own people among them, as was; who had the Gospel first preached to them, and were called by grace and saved; and who had an opportunity given them of escaping from Jerusalem, before the destruction of that city: but it may be more agreeable to interpret this of the state of the churches of Christ and true believers; who, when under affliction and distress, or in temptation and desertion, are ready to conclude that God is dealing with them in wrath; and whom the prophet personates, and by him they are taught to pray, that at such seasons God would remember his covenant, his promises, his lovingkindness and tender mercies, the favour he bears to his own people, and smile on them again, and comfort their souls. <p>(p) "tuam auditionem", V.

It seems also always to refer to something past and actual (unless <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-12.htm" title="When they shall go, I will spread my net on them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation has heard.">Hosea 7:12</a> be an exception); and this suggests that the allusion is to the divine manifestation at the Exodus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and <span class="ital">was afraid</span>] Or, <span class="ital">am afraid</span>. Of course the prophet or the community in whose name he speaks (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-14.htm" title="You did strike through with his staves the head of his villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.">Habakkuk 3:14</a></span>) did not fear hurt from the Theophany so long past, but the recital or the thought of it created alarm.

The term “revive” might mean to recall or bring back to life that which is dead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/6-2.htm" title="After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.">Hosea 6:2</a>), or to call into life and being what does not yet exist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-39.htm" title="See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.">Deuteronomy 32:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-6.htm" title="The LORD kills, and makes alive: he brings down to the grave, and brings up.">1 Samuel 2:6</a>). The “work” of Jehovah is that which He does, any operation which He performs, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm" title="Behold you among the heathen, and regard, and wonder marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which you will not believe, though it be told you.">Habakkuk 1:5</a>; but the word is often used of His great historical acts done for His people, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-1.htm" title="We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us, what work you did in their days, in the times of old.">Psalm 44:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-9.htm" title="When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.">Psalm 95:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-7.htm" title="But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which he did.">Deuteronomy 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/2-7.htm" title="And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.">Jdg 2:7</a>. The sense is thus either: bring into being a great act of Thine; or, renew, recall into life again, Thy former great work of redemption. The second sense is the more natural, and most in harmony with the following phrase “in the midst of the years.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in the midst of the years</span>] This cannot mean “within a few years” (Gesen.), a sense ill-suited to the tone of importunity in the passage; nor “amidst the years of distress,” because the idea of distress must have been expressed. The expression must describe the poet’s own time, for his prayer is for immediate divine interposition. Looking back to the far past event of the Exodus, the many years that have rolled by since then, he conceives of the position of himself and his people as amidst the years.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">midst of the years make known</span>] i.e. at this late time in our history make thy work known. Sept. regarded the verbal form as reflexive: <span class="ital">make thyself</span> (ox, let thyself be) <span class="ital">known</span>. So Wellh.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">In wrath remember mercy</span>] The “wrath” might be that lying on the people now; but it is more natural to understand it of the wrath which the judge will manifest when He intervenes among men. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm" title="Come, my people, enter you into your chambers, and shut your doors about you: hide yourself as it were for a little moment, until the indignation be over.">Isaiah 26:20</a>, “Come, O my people, enter into thy chambers, hide thyself for a little moment until the indignation be overpast.” At the thought or the recital of God’s interposition in the past—type of every interposition of His—the poet trembled; yet he would encounter it for the sake of that which will come after it, and he prays that it may come again; then he prays that in that day of universal wrath he and his people may have mercy shewn them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-10.htm" title="Because you have kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation, which shall come on all the world, to try them that dwell on the earth.">Revelation 3:10</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - &sect; 2. <span class="accented">The proemium, in which the prophet expresses his fear at the coming judgment, and prays God in his wrath to</span> remember mercy. <span class="cmt_word">Thy speech;</span> or, <span class="accented">the report of thee</span>; the declaration made by God in the preceding chapters concerning the punishment of the Jews and the destruction of the Chaldeans. The LXX., regarding the ambiguity of the Hebrew, gives a double rendering, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, and <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x1f15;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span>, "I heard thy report," and "I considered thy works." Pusey considers that both meanings are intended, viz. both what God had lately declared, and all that might be heard of God, his greatness and his workings. <span class="cmt_word">Was afraid.</span> The revelation of God's interposition makes the prophet tremble. <span class="cmt_word">Revive thy work.</span> God's work is the twofold judgment spoken of above; and the prophet prays God to "quicken" and make it live, because, though it brings temporary distress upon his countrymen, it will also cause the destruction of their enemies, and re-establish the Jews and crown them with salvation, and make the glory of God known to all the earth. Dr. Briggs ('Messianic Prophecy,' p. 234) translates, "Jahveh, I have heard the report of thee; I fear, Jahveh, thy work. In the midst of the years revive him (Israel)." He explains God's "work" to be his acts in theophany - his judgment, especially as in ver. 16, the cause of fear to the psalmist. <span class="cmt_word">In the midst of the years.</span> The "years" are the period between the announcement of the judgment and its final accomplishment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-3.htm">Habakkuk 2:3</a>); the prophet prays that God would manifest his power, not merely at the extreme limit of this epoch, but earlier, sooner. This overthrow of the world power forms, as it were, the central point of history, the beginning of a new age which shall culminate in the Messianic kingdom. <span class="cmt_word">Make known.</span> Let all the earth know and acknowledge thy work. The LXX. have given two or more versions of this passage, one of which is remarkable. Thus they read, "In the midst of two animals (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bf;&#x20;&#x3b6;&#x1f7d;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>) thou shalt be known; when the years draw nigh thou shalt be well known; when the time is come thou shalt be revealed." The rendering, "two animals," arises from a confusion of words  but many of the Fathers, who were conversant with the Greek Scriptures, saw herein a reference to the incarnation of our blessed Lord, as lying in the stable at Bethlehem between the ox and the ass, which was the mystical explanation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-3.htm">Isaiah 1:3</a>, "The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib." Others interpreted the two animals of the two thieves between whom Christ was crucified; or of angels and men; or Jews and Gentiles; or the two Testaments; or Moses and Elias. Others again accented the word <span class="greek">&#x3b6;&#x1ff6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> so as to understand "two lives," the present and the future, in the midst of which the Judge shall appear; or the life of Christ before his death and after his resurrection. There is a great truth underlying most of these interpretations, namely, that this magnificent hymn is concerned with the victories of Christ and his Church. In wrath remember mercy. When thine anger is displayed by sending the Chaldeans against us, remember thy mercy, and make a speedy end of our misery, and mitigate our enemies' cruelty (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-13.htm">Habakkuk 1:13</a>; and vers. 9, 13, 18, 19 of this chapter). The LXX. gives a double version, "In the troubling of my soul, in wrath, thou wilt remember mercy." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/4.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise of salvation opens, in closest connection with the destruction of Jerusalem and of the temple, with a picture of the glory awaiting in the remotest future the temple mountain, which has now become a wild forest-height. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>. "And it comes to pass at the end of the days, that the mountain of Jehovah's house will be established on the head of the mountains, and it will be exalted above the hills, and nations stream to it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>. And many nations go, and say, Up, let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, and to the house of the God of Jacob, that He may teach us of His ways, and we may walk in His paths: for from Zion will law go forth, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>. And He will judge between many nations, and pronounce sentence on strong nations afar off; and they forge their swords into coulters, and their spears into pruning-hooks: nation will not lift up sword against nation, nor will they learn war any more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-4.htm">Micah 4:4</a>. And they will sit, every one under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and no one will make them afraid: for the mouth of Jehovah of hosts hath spoken it."<p>(Note: This promise is placed by Isaiah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2-4</a>) at the head of his prophecy of Zion's way through judgment from the false glory to the true. The originality of the passage in Micah is open to no question. Delitzsch acknowledges this, and has given the principal arguments in its favour in the Commentary on Isaiah. For still more elaborate proofs, see Caspari's Micha, pp. 444-5.)<p>By the phrase "at the end of the days," which always denotes the Messianic era when used by the prophets (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/3-5.htm">Hosea 3:5</a>), the predicted exaltation of the temple mountain is assigned to the period of the completion of the kingdom of God. The mountain of the house of Jehovah is the temple mountain, strictly speaking, Moriah, as the distinction made between the mountain of the house and Zion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a> clearly shows; but as a subordinate peak of Zion, it is embraced along with Zion in what follows (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-7.htm">Micah 4:7</a>) as the seat of Jehovah's rule, from which the law proceeds. &#1504;&#1499;&#1493;&#1503; does not mean placed or set up, but established, founded. By connecting the participle with &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, the founding is designated as a permanent one. &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1492;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, upon (not at) the top of the mountains, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-7.htm">Judges 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-13.htm">1 Samuel 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-16.htm">Psalm 72:16</a>; whereas such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-13.htm">Micah 2:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-7.htm">Amos 6:7</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-9.htm">1 Kings 21:9</a> are of a different character, and have no bearing upon the point. The temple mountain, or Zion, will be so exalted above all the mountains and hills, that it will appear to be founded upon the top of the mountains. This exaltation is of course not a physical one, as Hofmann, Drechsler, and several of the Rabbins suppose, but a spiritual (ethical) elevation above all the mountains. This is obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>, according to which Zion will tower above all the mountains, because the law of the Lord issues from it. The assumption of a physical elevation cannot be established from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-2.htm">Ezekiel 40:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-10.htm">Revelation 21:10</a>, for in the visions described in both these passages the earthly elevation is a symbol of a spiritual one. "Through a new revelation of the Lord, which is made upon it, and which leaves the older revelations far behind, whether made upon Sinai or upon itself, Zion becomes the greatest and loftiest mountain in the world" (Caspari), and the mountain seen from afar, to which "nations" stream, and not merely the one nation of Israel.<p>&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is more precisely defined in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> as &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;. The attractive power which this mountain exerts upon the nations, so that they call upon one another to go up to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a>), does not reside in its height, which towers above that of all other mountains, but in the fact that the house of the God of Jacob stands upon it, i.e., that Jehovah is enthroned there, and teacher how to walk in His ways. &#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1502;&#1503;, to teach out of the ways, so that the ways of God form the material from which they derive continual instruction. The desire for salvation, therefore, is the motive which prompts them to this pilgrimage; for they desire instruction in the ways of the Lord, that they may walk in them. The ways of Jehovah are the ways which God takes in His dealing with men, and by which men are led by Him; in reality, therefore, the ordinances of salvation which He has revealed in His word, the knowledge and observance of which secure life and blessedness. The words "for the law goes forth from Zion," etc., are words spoken not by the nations, but by the prophet, and assign the reason why the heathen go with such zeal to the mountain of Jehovah. The accent is laid upon &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1503; (from Zion), which stands at the head, and &#1502;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1501; (from Jerusalem), which is parallel to it. Thence does to&#772;ra&#770;h, i.e., instruction in the ways of God, proceed, - in other words, the law as the rule of a godly life, and debhar Yeho&#772;va&#770;h (the word of Jehovah), or the word of revelation as the source of salvation. It is evident from this that the mountain of the house of God is not thought of here as the place of worship, but as the scene of divine revelation, the centre of the kingdom of God. Zion is the source of the law and word of the Lord, from which the nations draw instruction how to walk in the ways of God, to make it their own, take it to their homes, and walk according to it. The fruit of this adoption of the word of the Lord will be, that they will not longer fight out their disputes with weapons of war, but let Jehovah judge and settle them, and thus acknowledge Him as their King and Judge. &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1501; signifies to act as judge; &#1492;&#1493;&#1499;&#1497;&#1492; (lit., to set right), to settle and put a stop to a dispute. "Many nations," in contrast with the one nation, which formerly was alone in acknowledge Jehovah as its King and Judge. This is strengthened still further by the parallel "strong, mighty nations afar off." In consequence of this they will turn their weapons into instruments of peaceful agriculture, and wage no more war; in fact, they will learn war no more, no longer exercise themselves in the use of arms. For the words &#1493;&#1499;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-10.htm">Joel 3:10</a>, where the summons to the nations to a decisive conflict with the kingdom of God is described as turning the instruments of agriculture into weapons of war. With the cessation of war, universal peace will ensue, and Israel will have no further enemies to fear, so that every one will have undisturbed enjoyment of the blessings of peace, of which Israel had had a foretaste during the peaceful reign of Solomon. The words "sit under his vine" are taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-5.htm">1 Kings 5:5</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/3-10.htm">Zechariah 3:10</a>), and &#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491; from the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>. All this, however incredible it might appear, not only for the Israel of that time, but even now under the Christian dispensation, will assuredly take place, for the mouth of Jehovah the true God has spoken it. </body></html>
