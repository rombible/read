The resemblance between the Babylonish and Egyptian captivities, naturally presents itself to the mind, as well as the possibility of a like deliverance through the power of Jehovah. God appeared in his glory. All the powers of nature are shaken, and the course of nature changed, but all is for the salvation of God's own people. Even what seems least likely, shall be made to work for their salvation. Hereby is given a type and figure of the redemption of the world by Jesus Christ. It is for salvation with thine anointed. Joshua who led the armies of Israel, was a figure of Him whose name he bare, even Jesus, our Joshua. In all the salvations wrought for them, God looked upon Christ the Anointed, and brought deliverances to pass by him. All the wonders done for Israel of old, were nothing to that which was done when the Son of God suffered on the cross for the sins of his people. How glorious his resurrection and ascension! And how much more glorious will be his second coming, to put an end to all that opposes him, and all that causes suffering to his people!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou didst march the earth in indignation - The word "tread"  is used of very solemn manifestations of God, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-8.htm">Psalm 68:8</a>; of the procession of the ark, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm">2 Samuel 6:13</a>.

"And now many nations have assembled together against thee, who say, Let her be profaned, and let our eyes look upon Zion. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>. But they know not the thoughts of Jehovah, and understand not His counsel; for He has gathered them together like sheaves for the threshing-floor. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>. Rise up and thresh, O daughter Zion: for I make thy horn iron, and I make thy hoofs brass; and thou wilt crush many nations: and I ban their gain to Jehovah, and their substance to the Lord of the whole earth." With &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, corresponding to &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, there commences a new scene, which opens to the prophet's mental eye. Many nations have assembled together against the daughter Zion (&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; pointing back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>), with the intention of profaning her, and feasting their eyes upon the profaned one. It is the holiness of Zion, therefore, which drives the nations to attack her. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1504;&#1507;, let her be or become profaned: not by the sins or bloodguiltiness of her inhabitants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-2.htm">Jeremiah 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-5.htm">Isaiah 24:5</a>), for this is not appropriate in the mouths of heathen; but through devastation or destruction let her holiness be taken from her. They want to show that there is nothing in her holiness, and to feast their eyes upon the city thus profaned. &#1495;&#1494;&#1492; with &#1489;, to look upon a thing with interest, here with malicious pleasure. On the singular tachaz, followed by the subject in the plural, see Ewald 317, a. To this design on the part of the heathen, the prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>) opposes the counsel of the Lord. Whilst the heathen assemble together against Zion, with the intention of profaning her by devastation, the Lord has resolved to destroy them in front of Zion. The destruction which they would prepare for Zion will fall upon themselves, for the Lord gathers them together like sheaves upon the threshing-floor, to thresh, i.e., destroy, them. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; does not mean "that," but "for." The sentence explains the assertion that they do not understand the counsel of the Lord. &#1499;&#1468;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;, with the generic article, equivalent to "like sheaves." This judgment Zion is to execute upon the heathen. The figurative expression, "Rise up, and thresh," etc., rests upon the oriental custom of threshing out corn with oxen, i.e., of having it trodden out with their hoofs (see Paulsen, Ackerbau der Morgenlnder, 41). In this, of course, only the strength of the hoofs was considered. But as the horn of the ox is a figure frequently used for destructive power (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-17.htm">Deuteronomy 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm">Amos 6:13</a>, etc.), the prophet combines this figure, to strengthen the idea of crushing power, and express the thought that the Lord will equip Zion perfectly with the strength requisite to destroy the nations. &#1493;&#1492;&#1495;&#1512;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is the first person, and must not be altered into or regarded as the second, as it has been in the lxx and Syriac, and by Jerome. The prophet does not speak in the name of the theocratic nation, as Jerome supposes, but continues to represent Jehovah as speaking, as in &#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1501;, with which, however, instead of &#1500;&#1497;, the noun &#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is used, to give greater clearness to the thought that it is Jehovah, the God and Lord of the whole earth, who will destroy the nations that have rebelled against Him and His kingdom, wresting their possessions from them, and taking them back to Himself. For everything laid under the ban belonged to the Lord, as being most holy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-28.htm">Leviticus 27:28</a>). &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, property, wealth, the sum and substance of the possessions. Israel is not to enrich itself by plundering the defeated foe, but Jehovah will sanctify the possessions of the heathen to Himself, to whom they belong as Lord of the whole earth, by laying them under the ban: that is to say, He will apply them to the glorification of His kingdom.<p>There has been a diversity of opinion as to the historical allusion, or the fulfilment of these verses. So much, however, is obvious at the very outset, namely, that they cannot be made to refer to the same event as <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, that is to say, to the siege of Jerusalem by the Assyrians, without bringing the prophet into the most striking contradiction to himself. For, since <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a> predicts not a partial deportation, but the complete carrying away of Israel to Babel, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a> the perfect deliverance of Jerusalem, the people wandering out of Jerusalem into captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>) cannot possibly be the enemies who lead it away, beating it utterly before Jerusalem, and banning their possessions to the Lord. There is more to favour the allusion to the victorious conflicts of the Maccabees with the Syrians, for which Theodoret, Calvin, Hengstenberg, and others decide, since these conflicts occurred in the period intervening between the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>) and the coming of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-12.htm">Micah 5:12</a>). But even this allusion corresponds far too little to the words of the promise for us to be able to regard it as correct. Although, for example, the war of the Maccabees was a religious war in the strict sense of the word, since the Syrians, and with them the small neighbouring nations of the Jews, set themselves to attack Judah as the nation of God, and to exterminate Judaism, the go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m who have assembled against Zion, and whom the Lord gathers together thither (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>), point to a much greater even than the attacks made by the Syrians and the surrounding tribes upon Jerusalem in the time of the Maccabees. Go&#772;y&#305;&#772;, rabb&#305;&#772;m (many nations) points back to go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m and &#8219;amm&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a>, so that, both here and there, all the nations of the world that are hostile to God are included. Again, the defeat which they suffer before Jerusalem is much greater than the victory which the Maccabees achieved over their enemies. On the other hand, the circumstance that the Babylonian captivity is predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>, and the birth of the Messiah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1-2</a>, and that the victorious conflicts of the Maccabees with the Syrians and the heathen neighbours of the Jews lie in the interim between these events, furnishes no sufficient proof that these conflicts must be referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11-13</a>, simply because the assumption that, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a> -14, the attacks of the Chaldaeans, the Graeco-Syrians, and the Romans upon Zion are foretold in the order in which they followed one another in history, has no firm basis in the threefold recurrence of &#8219;atta&#770;h (now) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>. As an event is introduced with &#8219;atta&#770;h in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-9.htm">Micah 5:9</a>, which does not follow the one predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-8.htm">Micah 5:8</a> in chronological sequence, but, on the contrary, the prophet comes back in ve&#8219;atta&#770;h from the more remote to the more immediate future, it cannot be inferred from the &#8219;atta&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a> that the oppression mentioned there must follow the victory over many nations predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11-13</a> in chronological order, or that the siege and capture of Jerusalem by the Romans are referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm">Romans 5:1</a>. Moreover, the proclamation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a> already goes beyond the Chaldaean catastrophe, and the liberation of the Jews from the Chaldaean exile, so that if the ve&#8219;atta&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a> announces a conflict with Zion which will follow the events predicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-9.htm">Romans 5:9</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/5-10.htm">Romans 5:10</a>, we must not restrict the conflict to the wars of the Maccabees. We must therefore understand these verses as referring to the events already predicted by Joel (ch. 3), and afterwards by Ezekiel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38.htm">Ezekiel 38</a>, 39) and Zechariah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-1.htm">Zechariah 12:1-14</a>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-8.htm">Revelation 20:8</a>.: i.e., to the last great attack which the nations of the world will make upon the church of the Lord, that has been redeemed from Babel and sanctified, with the design of exterminating the holy city of God from the face of the earth, and to which the attacks of the Syrians, and the rest of the nations surrounding Judah, upon the covenant nation in the times of the Maccabees, furnished but a feeble prelude. This view is favoured by the unmistakeable similarity between our verses and both Joel and Ezekiel.<p>The &#1504;&#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>, compared with &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, points clearly back to &#1493;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>, compared with &#1493;&#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-11.htm">Micah 4:11</a>; and the figure in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-12.htm">Micah 4:12</a>, of the gathering together of the nations like sheaves for the threshing-floor, to the similar figures of the ripening of the harvest and the treading of the full wine-press in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-13.htm">Joel 3:13</a>. And the use of go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m in Micah is no reason for supposing that it differs in meaning from the kol-haggo&#772;y&#305;&#772;m of Joel, since Micah uses go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-2.htm">Micah 4:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-3.htm">Micah 4:3</a> for the totality of the nations of the world. Ezekiel, also, simply speaks of go&#772;y&#305;&#772;m rabb&#305;&#772;m as assembling together with Gog to attack the mountains of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-9.htm">Ezekiel 38:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-15.htm">Ezekiel 38:15</a>); and in his case also, this attack of the nations upon Jerusalem is appended to the redemption of Israel effected at Babel. Again, the issue of this attack is the same in Micah as in Joel, Ezekiel, and Zechariah, - namely, the complete overthrow of the hostile nations by the people of Israel, who fight in the strength of the Lord, by which Jehovah manifests Himself to all nations as Lord of the whole earth, and proves Himself to be the Holy One (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a> with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-12.htm">Joel 3:12-13</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-3.htm">Ezekiel 39:3</a>.). Lastly, a decisive proof of the correctness of this allusion is to be found in the circumstance, that the attack of the nations is directed against Zion, which has now become holy, that it proceeds from hatred and enmity to His holiness, and has for its object the desecration of the city of God. This feature is by no means applicable to Jerusalem and Judah in the time of the Maccabees, but can only apply to the time when Israel, redeemed from Babel, forms a holy church of God, i.e., to the last period of the development of the kingdom of God, which began with Christ, but has not yet reached its fullest manifestation. "From the fact, however, that Zion, when sanctified, is to be delivered out of much greater danger than that from which it will not be delivered in the immediate future, and also that the refined and sanctified Zion will conquer and destroy an incomparably greater hostile force than that to which it will now soon succumb, it follows, in the clearest and most conclusive way, that in the nearest future it must be given up to the power of the world, because it is now unholy" (Caspari). This thought prepares the way for the transition to <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>, where the prophecy returns to the oppression foretold in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-9.htm">Micah 4:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>. </body></html>
