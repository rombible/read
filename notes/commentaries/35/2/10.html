(Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm" title="Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and offend, imputing this his power to his god.">Habakkuk 1:11</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/habakkuk/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:5-14 The prophet reads the doom of all proud and oppressive powers that bear hard upon God's people. The lusts of the flesh, the lust of the eye, and the pride of life, are the entangling snares of men; and we find him that led Israel captive, himself led captive by each of these. No more of what we have is to be reckoned ours, than what we come honestly by. Riches are but clay, thick clay; what are gold and silver but white and yellow earth? Those who travel through thick clay, are hindered and dirtied in their journey; so are those who go through the world in the midst of abundance of wealth. And what fools are those that burden themselves with continual care about it; with a great deal of guilt in getting, saving, and spending it, and with a heavy account which they must give another day! They overload themselves with this thick clay, and so sink themselves down into destruction and perdition. See what will be the end hereof; what is gotten by violence from others, others shall take away by violence. Covetousness brings disquiet and uneasiness into a family; he that is greedy of gain troubles his own house; what is worse, it brings the curse of God upon all the affairs of it. There is a lawful gain, which, by the blessing of God, may be a comfort to a house; but what is got by fraud and injustice, will bring poverty and ruin upon a family. Yet that is not the worst; Thou hast sinned against thine own soul, hast endangered it. Those who wrong their neighbours, do much greater wrong to their own souls. If the sinner thinks he has managed his frauds and violence with art and contrivance, the riches and possessions he heaped together will witness against him. There are not greater drudges in the world than those who are slaves to mere wordly pursuits. And what comes of it? They find themselves disappointed of it, and disappointed in it; they will own it is worse than vanity, it is vexation of spirit. By staining and sinking earthly glory, God manifests and magnifies his own glory, and fills the earth with the knowledge of it, as plentifully as waters cover the sea, which are deep, and spread far and wide.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hast consulted shame to thy house, the cutting off many people, and sinning against thy soul - The wicked, whether out of passion or with his whole mind and deliberate choice and will, takes that counsel, which certainly brings shame to himself and his house, according to the law of God, whereby, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm">Exodus 20:5</a>, He "visits the iniquities of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate Him," i. e., until by righteousness and restitution the curse is cut off. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-27.htm">Proverbs 15:27</a> : "he that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house." So Jeremiah says <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-19.htm">Jeremiah 7:19</a> : "Thus saith the Lord, Is it Me they are vexing? Is it not themselves, for the confusion of their faces?" i. e., with that end and object. Holy Scripture overlooks the means, and places us at the end of all. Whatever the wicked had in view, to satisfy ambition, avarice, passion, love of pleasure, or the rest of man's immediate ends, all he was doing was leading on to a further end - shame and death. He was bringing about, not only these short-lived, but the lasting ends beyond, and these far more than the others, since that is the real end of a thing which abides, in which it at last ends. He consulted to cut off many people and was thereby (though he did not know it) by one and the same act, "guilty of and forfeiting his OWN soul" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-36.htm">Proverbs 8:36</a>. The contemporaneousness of the act is expressed by the participle; the pronoun is omitted as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-5.htm">Habakkuk 1:5</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

This is virtually correct. The verb in the present text is in the infinitive, and may depend upon the verb in the first clause.

The Greek and Latin Versions have, "Thy soul hath sinned." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>First strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. "And I said, Hear ye, O heads of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel: Is it not for you to know the right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2</a>. Ye who hate good, and love evil; who draw off their skin from them, and their flesh from their bones. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a>. And who have eaten the flesh of my people, and stripped off their skin from them; and broken their bones, and cut them in pieces, as if in the pot, and like flesh in the midst of the caldron. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>. Then will they cry to Jehovah, and He will not hearken; and let Him hide His face from them at the same time, as they have made their actions evil." By the expression "And I said" (va&#770;'o&#772;mar), the following address is indicated as a continuation of the preceding one. The reproofs of this chapter are also a still further expansion of the woe pronounced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1-2</a> upon the godless chiefs of the nation. The heads of Jacob are addressed, that is to say, the princes of the tribes and families of Israel, and the qets&#305;&#772;n&#305;&#772;m, lit., deciders (answering to the Arabic qa&#770;d&#803;y, a judge) of the house of Israel, i.e., the heads of families and households, upon whom the administration of justice devolved (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-10.htm">Isaiah 1:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-3.htm">Isaiah 22:3</a>). &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, is it not your duty and your office to know justice? Da&#8219;ath is practical knowledge, which manifests itself in practice; mishpa&#770;t, the public administration of justice. Instead of this, they do the opposite. The description of this conduct is appended by participles, in the form of apposition to the heads and princes addressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. Hating good and loving evil refer to the disposition, and indicate the radical corruption of these men. &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, generally misfortune, here evil; hence the Masoretes have altered it into &#1512;&#1506;; but the very fact that it deviates from the ordinary rule shows that it is the original word. Instead of administering justice to the people, they take off their skin, and tear the flesh from the bones. The suffixes attached to &#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1501; and &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; point back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>. The words answer to the German expression, "to pull the skin over the ears." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-3.htm">Micah 3:3</a> the expression is still stronger; but the address is continued in the form of a simple description, and instead of the participles, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; is used with the finite verb. They not only flay the people, i.e., rob them of all their means of subsistence, but even devour them - treat them like cattle, which men first of all flay, then break their bones, but the flesh into pieces, and boil it in the pot. In this figure, which is carried out into the most minute details, we must not give any special meaning to the particular features, such as that "the skin, and boiling portions, which are cut up and put into the pot, are figures signifying the pledged clothing and coveted fields (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>)." The prophet paints in very glaring colours, to make an impression upon the ungodly. Therefore, in the time of judgment, God will not hear their crying to Him for help, but will hide His face from them, i.e., withdraw His mercy from them. &#1488;&#1494; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; point back to the evil time announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-3.htm">Micah 2:3</a>. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-28.htm">Proverbs 1:28</a>. Veyaste&#772;r in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-4.htm">Micah 3:4</a> is an optative. The prophet continues the announcement of the punishment in the form of a desire. &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, as  equals  according to the way in which, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-18.htm">1 Samuel 28:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/27-14.htm">Numbers 27:14</a>, etc., i.e., answering to their evil doings. </body></html>
