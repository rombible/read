To give one drink who is in want, who is thirsty and poor, or a weary traveller, or ready to perish, is charity; but to give a neighbour drink, that he may expose himself, may disclose secret concerns, or be drawn into a bad bargain, or for any such purpose, this is wickedness. To be guilty of this sin, to take pleasure in it, is to do what we can towards the murder both of soul and body. There is woe to him, and punishment answering to the sin. The folly of worshipping idols is exposed. The Lord is in his holy temple in heaven, where we have access to him in the way he has appointed. May we welcome his salvation, and worship him in his earthly temples, through Christ Jesus, and by the influence of the Holy Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But then the greater is the "Woe" to him who deceiveth by them. The prophet passes away from the idols as "nothings" and pronounces "woe" on those who deceive by them. He . first expostulates with them on their folly, and would awaken them. "What hath it profited?" (As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/115-5.htm">Psalm 115:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-2.htm">1 Corinthians 12:2</a>) Then on the obstinate he denounces "woe." "Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone, Arise." Self-made blindness alone could, in the light of truth, so speak; but yet more lies in the emphatic word, "It." The personal pronoun stands emphatically in Hebrew; He shall teach, lo, He (this same of whom he speaks) this is It which shall teach: It, and not the living God. And yet this same It (the word is again emphatic) he points, as with the finger, to it, "behold, It is laid over with, held fast by , gold and silver," so that no voice could escape, if it had any. "And there is no breath at all in the midst of it" (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-14.htm">Jeremiah 10:14</a> repeated <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-17.htm">Jeremiah 51:17</a>), literally "All breath, all which is breath, there is none within it;" he first suggests the thought, breath of every sort, and then energetically denies it all ; no life of any sort, of man, or bird, or beast, or creeping thing <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-23.htm">Isaiah 41:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-5.htm">Jeremiah 10:5</a>; none, good or bad; from God or from Satan; none whereby it can do good or do evil; for which it should be loved or feared.

"Hear this, I pray, O he heads of the house of Jacob, and princes of the house of Israel, who abhor right, and bend all that is straight. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>. Building Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with wickedness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>. Their heads, they judge for reward; and their priests, they teach for hire; and their prophets, they divine for money, and lean upon Jehovah, saying, Is not Jehovah among us? evil will not come upon us." With the words "Hear this, I pray," the address returns to its starting-point in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-1.htm">Micah 3:1</a>, but only to announce to the leaders of the people the threat of punishment for which the way has been prepared by <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-2.htm">Micah 3:2-7</a>. To this end their God-forgetting conduct is briefly summed up once more in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-10.htm">Micah 3:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>. The summons to hear is really attached to the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-8.htm">Micah 3:8</a>. They are to hear the sin of Jacob (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9-11</a>); but they are also to hear the punishment for their sin, to which the word "this" points. The civil rulers only are addressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-9.htm">Micah 3:9</a>, - namely, those who were charged with the administration of justice and of the affairs of the state, but who did the very opposite, who abhorred justice, and made the straight crooked, because they passed sentence for bribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>). They thereby build Zion with blood, etc., i.e., obtain the means of erecting splendid buildings by cruel extortions, and partly also by actual judicial murders, as Ahab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21.htm">1 Kings 21</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-16.htm">Micah 6:16</a>), and after him Jehoiakim, had done (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13-17</a>). The Chaldeans built with blood in a different sense (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-12.htm">Habakkuk 2:12</a>). The participle bo&#772;neh (building) is also in apposition to ra&#770;'she&#772; be&#772;th (heads of the house, etc.), and the singular without the article is to be taken collectively. They do not, however, truly build the city by this, they simply labour for its destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-12.htm">Micah 3:12</a>). But before saying this, Micah once more sums up briefly all the sins of the leading ranks. The teaching of the priests for reward refers to the fact that they had to give instruction as to the ritual requirements of the law, and were to do this gratuitously (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-11.htm">Leviticus 10:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-11.htm">Deuteronomy 17:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-10.htm">Deuteronomy 33:10</a>), and that in disputed cases the judges were to pronounce sentence accordingly. At the same time, these men (not the prophets merely, but also the priests and the heads of the nation as the administrators of justice) placed their reliance upon Jehovah, upon the assurance that He was in the midst of them enthroned in His temple at Jerusalem, and that He would protect the city and its inhabitants from misfortune, without ever reflecting that Jehovah as the Holy One demands sanctification of life, and exterminates the sinners out of His people. </body></html>
