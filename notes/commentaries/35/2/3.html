When we have poured out complaints and requests before God, we must observe the answers God gives by his word, his Spirit, and providences; what the Lord will say to our case. God will not disappoint the believing expectations of those who wait to hear what he will say unto them. All are concerned in the truths of God's word. Though the promised favour be deferred long, it will come at last, and abundantly recompense us for waiting. The humble, broken-hearted, repenting sinner, alone seeks to obtain an interest in this salvation. He will rest his soul on the promise, and on Christ, in and through whom it is given. Thus he walks and works, as well as lives by faith, perseveres to the end, and is exalted to glory; while those who distrust or despise God's all-sufficiency will not walk uprightly with him. The just shall live by faith in these precious promises, while the performance of them is deferred. Only those made just by faith, shall live, shall be happy here and for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the vision is yet for an (the) appointed time - o Not for the present, but to develop itself in the course of time, down to a season which God only knows; as it is subsequently repeated (<a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-27.htm">Daniel 11:27</a>, for it is for the appointed time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-35.htm">Daniel 11:35</a>), "for the end is yet for the appointed time <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-19.htm">Daniel 8:19</a>; for it is for the appointed time of the end;" and is explained <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-1.htm">Daniel 10:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>, "for the vision is yet for the days <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm">Daniel 8:26</a>; for it is for many days <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>; the house of Israel say, The vision that he seeth, is for many days and he prophesieth of the times far off;" yet it should haste toward the end, toward its fulfillment, so that, if it is not at once fulfilled, it should be surely waited for. Theodotion: "It shall certainly be; not in vain hath it been shewn, but as certainly to be. For whatever hath been shown to come and to be, will come and be."<p>But at the end it shall speak - o (or it breatheth, hasteth to the end), not simply "to its own fulfillment," but to that time of the end which should close the period assigned to it, during which it should continually be putting itself forth, it should come true in part or in shadow, gleams of it should here and then part the clouds, which, until the end, should surround and envelop it.<p>Being God's truth, he speaks of it as an animate living thing, not a dead letter, but running, hasting on its course, and accomplishing on its way that for which it was sent. The will and purpose of God hasteth on, though to man it seemeth to tarry; it can neither be hurried on, nor doth it linger; before "the appointed time" it cometh not; yet it hasteth toward it, and "will not be behindhand" when the time comes. It does not lie, either by failing to come, or failing, when come, of any jot or tittle. "Though it tarry or linger" , continually appearing, giving signs of itself, yet continually delaying its coming, "wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not be behindhand" , when the time comes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-7.htm">Revelation 22:7</a>, "He cometh quickly" also, as He saith; because, from Dion.: "though the delay of His coming and of the fulfillment of the vision seem long, yet, in comparison with eternity, it is very short. In His first coming, He taught why God permitteth these things; in the second coming, He shall teach by experience, how good it it is for the good to bear the persecution of the evil; whence Peter also has to say <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, "The Lord is not slack concerning His promise, as some men count slackness." The words seem to belong, in the first instance, to the vision itself; but the vision had no other existence or fulfillment than in Him who was the Object of it, and who, in it, was foreshadowed to the mind. The coming of the vision was no other than His coming.<p>The waiting, to which he exhorts, expresses the religious act, so often spoken of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/33-20.htm">Psalm 33:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-17.htm">Isaiah 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-18.htm">Isaiah 30:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-3.htm">Isaiah 64:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-8.htm">Zephaniah 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-12.htm">Daniel 12:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/106-13.htm">Psalm 106:13</a>, of waiting for God, or His counsel, or His promised time. The sense then is wholly the same, when Paul uses the words of the coming of our Lord Himself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a>, "Yet a little while, and He that shall come, will come and will not tarry." Paul, as well as Habakkuk, is speaking of our Lord's second coming; Paul, of His Coming in Person, Habakkuk, of the effects of that Coming ; but both alike of the redressing of all the evil and wrong in the world's history, and the reward of the faithful oppressed. At His first coming He said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm">John 12:31</a>, "Now is the judgment of this world; now shall the prince of this world be cast out." He came to "put down the mighty from their seat, and to exalt the humble and meek <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-52.htm">Luke 1:52</a>;" but much more in the second coming, when "He shall come to judge the world with righteousness and the people with His truth" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/46-1.htm">Psalm 46:1-11</a> :13, and to "reward every man according to his works" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>. At all times He seemeth continually to linger, to give signs of His coming, yet He cometh not; when the appointed season shall come, He shall be found not to be later than His word. Yea, all time shall shrink up into a little moment in the presence of a never-ending ever-present eternity.<p>Cyril: "Having named no one expressly, he says, wait for him, wait for him although delaying, and halt not in thy hope, but let it be rooted and firm, even if the interval be extended. For the God of all seemeth to suggest to the mind of the prophet, that He who was foretold would surely come, yet to enjoin on him to wait for Him on account of the interval. He who believeth My word shall possess life, for this is the reward of these who honor God, and a good reward of His benevolence. He who admitteth faith and love to dwell in his heart hath as a requital, unaging life and forgiveness of sins and sanctification by the Spirit." Alb.: "He shall live; for, God is not the God of the dead but of the living <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/22-32.htm">Matthew 22:32</a>, "Whoso liveth and believeth in Me, shall never die" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-26.htm">John 11:26</a>.<p>It will not lie - God vouchsafes to speak of Himself, as we should be ashamed to speak of one whom we love, teaching us that all doubts question His truth <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a> "God is not a man, that He should lie: hath He said and shall He not do it?" "The strength of Israel shall neither lie nor repent" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>. "God that cannot lie promised before the world began" <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-2.htm">Titus 1:2</a> Therefore, it follows, "wait for Him," as Jacob says, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/49-18.htm">Genesis 49:18</a>, "I have waited for Thy salvation, O Lord." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. for&#8212;assigning the cause why it ought to be committed to writing: because its fulfilment belongs to the future.<p>the vision is yet for an appointed time&#8212;(Da 10:14; 11:27, 35).

Not the present vision only, but vision or prophecy in general: it was a doubt that arose in the minds of the prophet and other good men, upon the notice given that the Chaldeans would be raised up to the destruction of the Jews; that then the law of God would cease, his worship would not continue; vision and prophecy would be no more; it would be all over with the doctrine of the law and the prophets: now in answer to this, and to remove this doubt, they are assured that vision or prophecy should "yet", or still, continue, and even "to the appointed time"; the time fixed for the continuance of it, notwithstanding the people of the Jews should be carried captive into another land: and accordingly so it was; there were prophets, as Daniel and Ezekiel, in the time of the captivity; and, after it, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi; yea, the law and the prophets were until John; for vision and prophecy were to be sealed up by the Messiah, and not before; see  <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a> it was true indeed with respect to the present vision or prophecy concerning the Messiah, that that was not to be fulfilled presently; there was some considerable time first to elapse; there was a time appointed for the accomplishment of it, and it would remain till that time, and then be most surely fulfilled; which would be before the sceptre departed from Judah, while the second temple was yet standing, and when Daniel's seventy weeks, or four hundred and ninety years, were come; which were the limited, determined, and appointed time for the Messiah's coming, the time appointed of the Father, the fulness of time; so there was an appointed time for his coming to take vengeance on the Jewish nation, for their rejection of him, to which the apostle applies these words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a> and also for his spiritual coming, to visit his people in a gracious way; there is a set time to favour Zion and her children; as well as there is a day fixed for his second coming, or coming to judgment. <p>But at the end it shall speak, and not lie; or rather, "he shall speak" (y); and so in the following clauses it should be rendered, not "it", but "he"; and so the apostle has taught us to interpret it of a person, and not a thing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-37.htm">Hebrews 10:37</a> that is, "at the end" of the time appointed, or at the end of the Jewish state, both civil and ecclesiastic, the Messiah should appear, as he did, which is called the end of the world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm">1 Corinthians 10:11</a> when a new world began, the world to come, the Gospel dispensation, of which Christ is said to be the Father, in the Greek version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-5.htm">Hebrews 2:5</a> and being come, he shall "speak"; or, as it may be rendered, "at the end thereof" shall be "the speaker", or "preacher" (z); that shall publish and proclaim the glad tidings of the Gospel; and this agrees with Christ, the Logos, or Word of God, the great Prophet that should be raised up in the church, the teacher sent of God, the Wonderful Counsellor, and faithful witness; who spoke out the whole mind and will of God; published the everlasting Gospel; delivered out the doctrines of grace and truth; and spoke such words of grace as never man did, and with such power and authority as the Scribes and Pharisees did not. Some render the words, "and he shall break forth as the morning" (a); so the word is used in Sol 2:17 and so the Septuagint version, "he shall arise at the end"; like the rising sun: this agrees with Christ, the day spring from on high, and whose coming is said to be as the morning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-78.htm">Luke 1:78</a> and when he should thus appear, and exercise his prophetic office, he should "not lie"; this is the character of God himself, as opposed to a mere man, who is subject to lying and deceit; and suits well with Christ, who is truly God, and not a mere man; and answers to his character in prophecy and fact, that there was no guile in his mouth and lips, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-4.htm">Isaiah 53:4</a> and fitly describes him as a preacher, who is truth itself; taught the way of God in truth; spoke the word of truth, the Gospel of our salvation; and no lie is of the truth; and who is infallible in all his doctrines, and does not and cannot deceive any; all his words are to be depended upon as faithful and true. <p>Though it tarry, wait for it; or "though he tarry, wait for him"; not that he really would or did tarry; but he might seem to do so, not coming so soon as the Old Testament saints expected, and as they wished for and desired; it was a long time from the first promise of him; and sometimes the saints were ready to give it up, and their hearts to sink and faint, because it was seemingly deferred. This shows that this prophecy does not respect the Babylonish captivity; for that had no seeming delay, but, as soon as ever the seventy years were up, there was a deliverance from it; but the Messiah's coming was long expected, and seemed to be deferred, and the patience of the saints was almost wore out; but they are here encouraged, when this was the case, still to wait for him, as good old Simeon and others did, about the time of his coming; and so his spiritual and second coming should be waited patiently for, though they may seem to be delayed. <p>Because it will surely come, it will not tarry; or "for he that is to come", or "is coming, will come (b), and not tarry"; beyond the appointed time. This is a periphrasis of the Messiah; for, being so often spoken of as to come, it became a description of him, "he that is to come"; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-3.htm">Matthew 11:3</a> and as it was foretold he would come, so assuredly he would come, and not stay a moment longer than the time appointed of the Father; in which fulness of time God sent him, and he came, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-3.htm">Galatians 4:3</a>. The person here prophesied of is not Jeremiah, as Jarchi, but the Messiah; and this is acknowledged by some Jewish writers, ancient and modern; and removes the doubt and objection that might arise from the Chaldeans coming upon the Jews, and carrying them captive, as if the promise of the Messiah would fail, whereas it would not. In the Talmud (c), they say, <p>"God does not renew his world till after seven thousand years; another says five thousand. R. Nathan says, this Scripture penetrates and descends into the abyss; i.e. fixes no particular time; "the vision is for an appointed time", &amp;c.; not as our Rabbins, who inquire the meaning of a time, and times, and half a time; what then is meant, "but at the end it shall speak", and "not lie?" Let them burst that compute the times, who used to say when the time comes, and he cometh not, he will never come; but wait for him, as it is said, "if he tarry, wait for him": perhaps you will say, we wait, but he does not wait; this may be an instruction to you what he says, "therefore the Lord waiteth to be gracious", &amp;c.'' <p>Maimonides says (d), their twelfth fundamental article of faith is, the days of the Messiah; that is, to believe, and be firmly persuaded, that he will come, nor will he tarry; "if he tarry, wait for him": though, he observes, this Scripture does not fix the certain time; nor is it to be so expounded, so as to gather from thence the exact time of his coming. This they do not choose to own, though it does, because the time is long ago elapsed. Abarbinel (e) owns that this vision is different from that in the preceding verse <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-2.htm">Habakkuk 2:2</a>, which concerns the second temple, but this another redemption; and would have it that the words may be explained thus, he that shall come will come at the time appointed, which is mentioned; and, after his coming, the King Messiah shall not tarry from coming to redeem you; which, though a wrong sense, shows his conviction of the prophecy belonging to the Messiah. So Abendana (f) says, our Rabbins understand this, "at the end it shall speak", of the end of our redemption from this captivity in which we now are; and in this way it appears right to explain it, for the prophet was complaining of the prosperity of Nebuchadnezzar; and the Lord answers him, that he should write the vision of the destruction of Babylon, which should be at the end of seventy years; and said, do not wonder that I prolong to Babylon seventy years, for "yet the vision is for an appointed time": as if he should say, yet there is a vision for times afar off, "and at the end it shall speak": in all which there are plain traces of the sense the ancient synagogue put on this text, though now perverted, to favour their hypothesis of the Messiah being yet to come and save them. <p>(y) "idque ille loquetur", Castalio.

"Drip not (prophesy not), they drip: if they drip not this, the shame will not depart. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a>. Thou, called house of Jacob, is the patience of Jehovah short, then? or is this His doing? Are not my words good to him that walketh uprightly?" &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507;, to drip, to cause words to flow, used of prophesying, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-16.htm">Amos 7:16</a>. The speakers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a> are not the Jews generally, or the rich oppressors who have just been punished and threatened. The word yatt&#305;&#772;phu&#772; does not agree with this, since it does not mean to chatter, but to prophesy, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> and also the primary passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a> show. But Micah could not call the rich men's speaking prophesying. It is rather false prophets who are speaking, - namely, those who in the word 'al-tatt&#305;&#772;phu&#772; (prophesy not) would prohibit the true prophets from predicting the judgments of the Lord. The second hemistich is rendered by most of the modern commentators, "they are not to chatter (preach) of such things; the reproaches cease not," or "there is no end to reproaching" (Ewald, Hitzig, Maurer, and Caspari). But this is open to the following objections: (1) That &#1492;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1507; &#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> means to prophesy to a person (not concerning or of anything); (2) that su&#772;g or na&#770;sag means to depart, not to cease; (3) that even the thought, "the reproaches to not cease," is apparently unsuitable, since Micah could not well call a prohibition against prophesying an incessant reproach; and to this we may add, (4) the grammatical harshness of taking &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1496;&#1468;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468; as an imperative, and the following &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1505;&#1468;&#1490; as an indicative (a simple declaration). Still less can the rendering, "they (the true prophets) will not chatter about this, yet the reproach will not depart" (Ros., Rckert), be vindicated, as such an antithesis as this would necessarily be indicated by a particle. The only course that remains, therefore, is that adopted by C. B. Michaelis and Hengstenberg, viz., to take the words as conditional: if they (the true prophets) do not prophesy to these (the unrighteous rich in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> : Hengstenberg), or on account of these things (Michaelis), the shame will not depart, i.e., shameful destruction will burst incessantly upon them. On the absence of the conditional &#1488;&#1501;, see Ewald, p. 357, b. Such addresses as these do not please the corrupt great men; but they imagine that such threats are irreconcilable with the goodness of Jehovah. This is the connection of <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-7.htm">Micah 2:7</a>, in which the prophet meets the reproach cast upon his threatening words with the remark, that God is not wrathful, and has no love for punishing, but that He is stirred up to wrath by the sins of the nation, and obliged to punish. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is not an exclamation, "O, what is said!  equals  O for such talk as this!" (Ewald, Umbreit, Caspari); for it cannot be shown that the participle is ever used in this way, and it cannot be supported from &#1492;&#1508;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-16.htm">Isaiah 29:16</a>, especially as here a second vocative would follow. Nor is it a question: Num dicendum? Dare one say this?" (Hitzig). For although he might be an interrogative particle (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-9.htm">Ezekiel 28:9</a>), the passive participle cannot express the idea of daring, in support of which Hitzig is quite wrong in appealing to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/11-47.htm">Leviticus 11:47</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-32.htm">Psalm 22:32</a>. &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is not doubt a vocative, but it is to be taken in connection with be&#772;th-Ya&#8219;aqo&#772;b: thou who art called house of Jacob. There is very little force in the objection, that this would have required &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1500;&#1498; &#1489; &#1497;, since &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, when used in the sense of being called or being named, is always construed with &#1500; of the person bearing the name. The part. pal of 'a&#770;mar only occurs here; and although the niphal, when used in this sense, is generally construed with &#1500;, the same rule may apply to &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; as to &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; in the sense of naming, - namely, that in the passive construction the &#1500; may either be inserted or omitted (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-7.htm">Isaiah 56:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-5.htm">Isaiah 54:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>), and &#1492;&#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; may just as well be used in the sense of dicta (domus) as &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-1.htm">Isaiah 48:1</a> in the sense of vocati  equals  qui appellantur. The whole nation is addressed, although the address points especially to the unrighteous great men. Is Jehovah indeed wrathful? i.e., has He not patience, does He not exercise long-suffering? Qa&#772;tsar ru&#772;a&#774;ch must not be explained according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/6-9.htm">Exodus 6:9</a>, but according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/14-27.htm">Proverbs 14:27</a>. Or are these ('e&#772;lleh, the punishments threatened) His deeds? i.e., is He accustomed, or does He only like to punish? The answer to these questions, or speaking more correctly, their refutation, follows in the next question, which is introduced with the assuring &#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488;, and in which Jehovah speaks: My words deal kindly with him that walks uprightly. The Lord not only makes promises to the upright, but He also grants His blessing. The words of the Lord contain their fulfilment within themselves. In &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1498;, it is for the sake of emphasis that ya&#770;sha&#770;r stands first, and the article properly belongs to ho&#772;le&#772;kh; but it is placed before yshr to bind together the two words into one idea. The reason why the Lord threatens by His prophets is therefore to be found in the unrighteousness of the people. </body></html>
