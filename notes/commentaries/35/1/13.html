The Hebrews give the common name of <span class="ital">reptiles </span>to all fishes. <span class="ital">They take up all of them with the angle </span>— The prophet, having in the preceding verse compared men to fishes, continues here, by way of metaphor, to describe the advantages which the Chaldeans gained over other nations, by the several ways used by fishermen in taking fishes, as by catching them with the angle, enclosing them in nets, and gathering them in drags. <span class="ital">Therefore they rejoice and are glad — </span>On account of the prey they take; that is, the Chaldeans rejoice in taking a great number of captives, and gathering rich spoils, as fishermen rejoice when they catch a great number of fishes. <span class="ital">Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, </span>&c. — They impute all their victories to their own strength and skill, or to idols of their own making, and render no acknowledgments to God for their success. <span class="ital">Because by them their portion is fat, </span>&c. — Because by means of their victories they get abundance of rich spoil. <span class="ital">Shall they therefore empty their net — </span>Carry away the riches and spoils of their conquests, (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-13.htm" title="And he carried out there all the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.">2 Kings 24:13</a>,) in order to undertake more; just as fishermen empty their nets to fill them again.

We are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others, and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil - The prophet repeats his complaint (as troubling thoughts are accustomed to come back, after they have been repelled,), in order to answer it more strongly. All sin is hateful in God's sight, and in His Holy Wisdom He cannot endure to "look toward iniquity." As man turns away from sickening sights, so God's abhorrence of wrong is pictured by His not being able to "look toward it." If He looked toward them, they must perish <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-32.htm">Psalm 104:32</a>. Light cannot co-exist with darkness, fire with water, heat with cold, deformity with beauty, foulness with sweetness, nor is sin compatible with the Presence of God, except as its Judge and punisher. Thou canst not look. There is an entire contradiction between God and unholiness. And yet,<p>Wherefore lookest thou upon - viewest, as in Thy full sight  make the contrast stronger. God cannot endure "to look toward" (&#1488;&#1500;) iniquity, and yet He does not only this, but beholdeth it, contemplateth it, and still is silent), yea, as it would seem, with favor , bestowing upon them the goods of this life, honor, glory, children, riches, as the Psalmist saith <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-12.htm">Psalm 73:12</a>; "Behold these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world, they increase in riches?" Why lookest thou upon "them that deal treacherously, holdest Thy tongue," puttest restraint , as it were, upon Thyself and Thine own attribute of Justice, "when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/143-2.htm">Psalm 143:2</a> "in God's sight no man living can be justified;" and, in one sense, Sodom and Gomorrah were less unrighteous than Jerusalem, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-15.htm">Matthew 10:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-24.htm">Matthew 11:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12</a> "it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of Judgment," because they sinned against less light; yet the actual sins of the Chaldee were greater than those of Jerusalem, and Satan's evil is greater than that of these who are his prey.<p>To say that Judah was more righteous than the Chaldaean does not imply any righteousness of the Chaldaean, as the saying that (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-11.htm">Jeremiah 31:11</a>, Del.) "God ransomed Jacob from the hand of one stronger than he," does not imply any strength remaining to Israel. Then, also, in all the general judgments of God, the righteous too suffer in this world, whence Abraham intercedes for Sodom, if there were but ten righteous in it; lest <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-23.htm">Genesis 18:23</a> "the righteous be destroyed with the wicked." Hence, God also spared Nineveh in part as having <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-11.htm">Jonah 4:11</a> "more than sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern between their right hand and their left hand," i. e., good from evil. No times were more full of sin than those before the destruction of Jerusalem, yet the fury of the Assassins fell upon the innocent. And so the words, like the voice of the souls under the Altar <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, become the cry of the Church at all times against the oppressing world, and of the blood of the martyrs from Abel to the end, "Lord, how long?" And in that the word "righteous"  signifies both "one righteous man," and the whole class or generation of the righteous, it speaks both of Christ the Head and of all His members in whom (as by Saul) He was persecuted. The wicked also includes all persecutors, both those who executed the Lord Christ, and those who brought His servants before judgment-seats, and who blasphemed His Name <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm">James 2:6-7</a>, and caused many to blaspheme, and killed those whom they could not compel.

The Lord with his eyes of omniscience beholds all things good and evil, and all men good and bad, with all their actions; but then he does not look upon the sins of men with pleasure and approbation; since they are contrary to his nature, repugnant to his will, and breaches of his righteous law: and though sin in general may be included here, yet there seems to be a particular respect had to the "evil" or injury done by the Chaldeans to the Jews, in invading their land, spoiling their substance, and slaying their persons; and to the "iniquity", labour, or grievance, by which may be meant the oppression and violence the same people exercised upon the inhabitants of Judea; which, though permitted by the Lord, could not be well pleasing in his sight.

This spreading is depicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13-15</a> in the same manner as before. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-13.htm">Micah 1:13</a>. "Harness the horse to the chariot, O inhabitress of Lachish! It was the beginning of sin to the daughter Zion, that the iniquities of Israel were found in her. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>. Therefore wilt thou give dismissal-presents to Moresheth-gath (i.e., the betrothed of Gath); the houses of Achzib (lying fountain) become a lying brook for Israel's kings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-15.htm">Micah 1:15</a>. I will still bring thee the heir, O inhabitress of Mareshah (hereditary city); the nobility of Israel will come to Adullam. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>. Make thyself bald, and shave thyself upon the sons of thy delights: spread out thy baldness like the eagle; for they have wandered away from thee." The inhabitants of Lachish, a fortified city in the Shephelah, to the west of Eleutheropolis, preserved in the ruins of Um Lakis (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-3.htm">Joshua 10:3</a>), are to harness the horses to the chariot (rekhesh, a runner; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a> : the word is used as ringing with la&#770;kh&#305;&#772;sh), namely, to flee as rapidly as possible before the advancing foe. &#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. "to bind ... the horse to the chariot," answering to the Latin currum jungere equis. Upon this city will the judgment fall with especial severity, because it has grievously sinned. It was the beginning of sin to the daughter of Zion, i.e., to the population of Jerusalem; it was the first to grant admission to the iniquities of Israel, i.e., to the idolatry of the image-worship of the ten tribes (for &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-14.htm">Amos 3:14</a>), which penetrated even to the capital. Nothing more is known of this, as the historical books contain no account of it. For this reason, namely, because the sin of Israel found admission into Jerusalem, she (the daughter Zion) will be obliged to renounce Moresheth-gath. This is the thought of <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-14.htm">Micah 1:14</a>, the drapery of which rests upon the resemblance in sound between Moresheth and me'ora&#770;sa&#770;h, the betrothed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>). Shillu&#772;ch&#305;&#772;m, dismissal, denotes anything belonging to a man, which he dismisses or gives up for a time, or for ever. It is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-2.htm">Exodus 18:2</a> to the sending away of wife and children to the father-in-law for a time; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a> to a dowry, or the present which a father gives to his daughter when she is married and leaves his house. The meaning "divorce," i.e., se&#772;pher ker&#305;&#772;thuth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-3.htm">Deuteronomy 24:3</a>), has been arbitrarily forced upon the word. The meaning is not to be determined from shille&#772;a&#774;ch in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-8.htm">Jeremiah 3:8</a>, as Hitzig supposes, but from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-16.htm">1 Kings 9:16</a>, where the same expression occurs, except that it is construed with &#1500;, which makes no material difference. For &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500; signifies to give to a person, either to lay upon him or to hand to him; &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1500;, to give to him. The object given by Zion to Moresheth as a parting present is not mentioned, but it is really the city itself; for the meaning is simply this: Zion will be obliged to relinquish all further claim to Moresheth, to give it up to the enemy. Mo&#772;resheth is not an appellative, as the old translators suppose, but the proper name of Micah's home; and Gath is a more precise definition of its situation - "by Gath," viz., the well-known Philistian capital, analogous to Bethlehem-Judah in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/17-7.htm">Judges 17:7-9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19-1.htm">Judges 19:1</a>, or Abel-maim (Abel by the water) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-4.htm">2 Chronicles 16:4</a>. According to Jerome (comm. in Mich. Prol.), Morasthi, qui usque hodie juxta Eleutheropolin, urbem Palaestinae, haud grandis est viculus (cf. Robinson, Pal. ii. p. 423). The context does not admit of our taking the word in an appellative sense, "possession of Gath," since the prophet does not mean to say that Judah will have to give up to the enemy a place belonging to Gath, but rather that it will have to give up the cities of its own possession. For, as Maurer correctly observes, "when the enemy is at the gate, men think of defending the kingdom, not of enlarging it." But if the addition of the term Gath is not merely intended to define the situation of Moresheth with greater minuteness, or to distinguish it from other places of the same name, and if the play upon words in Moresheth was intended to point to a closer relation to Gath, the thought expressed could only be, that the place situated in the neighbourhood of Gath had frequently been taken by the Philistines, or claimed as their property, and not that they were in actual possession of Gath at this time.<p>The play upon words in the second clause of the verse also points to the loss of places in Judaea: "the houses of Achzib will become Achzab to the kings of Israel." &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;, a lie, for &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1489;, is a stream which dries up in the hot season, and deceives the expectation of the traveller that he shall find water (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-18.htm">Jeremiah 15:18</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-15.htm">Job 6:15</a>.). Achzib, a city in the plain of Judah, whose name has been preserved in the ruins of Kussabeh, to the south-west of Beit-Jibrin (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>). The houses of Achzib are mentioned, because they are, properly speaking, to be compared to the contents of the river's bed, whereas the ground on which they stood, with the wall that surrounded them, answered to the river's bed itself (Hitzig), so that the words do not denote the loss or destruction of the houses so much as the loss of the city itself. The "kings of Israel" are not the kings of Samaria and Judah, for Achzib belonged to the kingdom of Judah alone, but the kings of Judah who followed one another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-13.htm">Jeremiah 19:13</a>); so that the plural is to be understood as relating to the monarchy of Israel (Judah). Mareshah will also pass into other hands. This is affirmed in the words, "I will bring the heir to thee again" (&#1488;&#1489;&#1497; for &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-29.htm">1 Kings 21:29</a>). The first heir of Mareshah was the Israelites, who received the city, which had been previously occupied by the Canaanites, for their possession on the conquest of the land. The second heir will be the enemy, into whose possession the land is now to pass. Mareshah, also in the lowland of Judah, has been preserved, so far as the name is concerned, in the ruins of Marash (see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-44.htm">Joshua 15:44</a>, and Tobler, Dritte Wanderung, pp. 129, 142-3). To the north of this was Adullam (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-15.htm">Joshua 12:15</a>), which has not yet been discovered, but which Tobler (p. 151) erroneously seeks for in Be&#770;t Du&#770;la. Micah mentions it simply on account of the cave there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-1.htm">1 Samuel 22:1</a>), as a place of refuge, to which the great and glorious of Israel would flee ("the glory of Israel," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-13.htm">Isaiah 5:13</a>). The description is rounded off in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, by returning to the thought that Zion would mourn deeply over the carrying away of the people, with which it had first set out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8</a>. In &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; Zion is addressed as the mother of the people. &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;, to shave smooth, and &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1494;, to cut off the hair, are synonyms, which are here combined to strengthen the meaning. The children of thy delights, in whom thou hast thy pleasure, are the members of the nation. Shaving the head bald, or shaving a bald place, was a sing of mourning, which had been handed down as a traditional custom in Israel, in spite of the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-1.htm">Deuteronomy 14:1</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-28.htm">Leviticus 19:28</a>). The bald place is to be made to spread out like that of a nesher, i.e., not the true eagle, but the vulture, which was also commonly classed in the eagle family, - either the bearded vulture, vultur barbatus (see Oedmann, Verm. Samml. i. p. 54ff.), or more probably the carrion vulture, vultur percnopterus L., common in Egypt, and also in Palestine, which has the front part of the head completely bald, and only a few hairs at the back of the head, so that a bald place may very well be attributed to it (see Hasselquist, Reise, p. 286ff.). The words cannot possibly be understood as referring to the yearly moulting of the eagle itself.<p>If we inquire still further as to the fulfilment of the prophecy concerning Judah (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-8.htm">Micah 1:8-16</a>), it cannot be referred, or speaking more correctly, it must not be restricted, to the Assyrian invasion, as Theod., Cyril, Marck, and others suppose. For the carrying away of Judah, which is hinted at in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-11.htm">Micah 1:11</a>, and clearly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>, was not effected by the Assyrians, but by the Chaldeans; and that Micah himself did not expect this judgment from the Assyrians, but from Babel, is perfectly obvious from <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/4-10.htm">Micah 4:10</a>, where he mentions Babel as the place to which Judah was to be carried into exile. At the same time, we must not exclude the Assyrian oppression altogether; for Sennacherib had not only already conquered the greater part of Judah, and penetrated to the very gates of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-13.htm">2 Kings 18:13-14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-19.htm">2 Kings 18:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-1.htm">Isaiah 36:1-38:22</a>), but would have destroyed the kingdom of Judah, as his predecessor Shalmaneser had destroyed the kingdom of Israel, if the Lord had not heard the prayer of His servant Hezekiah, and miraculously destroyed Sennacherib's army before the walls of Jerusalem. Micah prophesies throughout this chapter, not of certain distinct judgment, but of judgment in general, without any special allusions to the way in which it would be realized; so that the proclamation embraces all the judgments that have fallen upon Judah from the Assyrian invasion down to the Roman catastrophe. </body></html>
