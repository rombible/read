No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves.

The word in its intensive form is used both of God's enfolding the soul within His tender supporting love , and of man clinging and holding fast to divine wisdom <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/4-8.htm">Proverbs 4:8</a>. It fits in with the subject of his prophecy, faith, cleaving fast to God amid the perplexities of things seen. Dion.: "He who is spiritually Habakkuk, cleaving fast to God with the arms of love, or enfolding Him after the manner of one holily wrestling, until he is blessed, enlightened, and heard by Him, is the seer here." "Let him who would in such wise fervidly embrace God and plead with Him as a friend, praying earnestly for the deliverance and consolation of himself and others, but who sees not as yet, that his prayer is heard, make the same holy plaint, and appeal to the clemency of the Creator." (Jer. Abarbanel has the like: "He strengthens himself in pleading his cause with God as to the prosperity of Nebuchadnezzar as if he were joined with God for the cause of his people" Preface to Ezekiel). "He is called 'embrace' either because of his love to the Lord; or because he engages in a contest and strife and (so to speak) wrestling with God." For no one with words so bold ventured to challenge God to a discussion of His justice and to say to Him, "Why, in human affairs and the government of this world is there so great injustice?"<p>The prophet - The title, "the prophet," is added only to the names of Habakkuk, Haggai, Zechariah. Habakkuk may have added it to his name instead because he prominently expostulates with God, like the Psalmists, and does not speak in the name of God to the people. The title asserts that he exercised the pastoral office of the prophets, although not directly in this prophecy.<p>Did see - Cyril: "God multiplied visons, as is written <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-10.htm">Hosea 12:10</a>, and Himself spoke to the prophets, disclosing to them beforehand what should be, and all but exhibiting them to sight, as if already present. But that they determined not to speak from their own, but rather transmit to us the words from God, he persuades us at the outset, naming himself a prophet, and showing himself full of the grace belonging thereto." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE BOOK OF HABAKKUK Commentary by A. R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>Habakkuk, from a Hebrew root meaning to "embrace," denoting a "favorite" (namely, of God) and a "struggler" (for his country's good). Some ancient authors represent him as belonging to the tribe of Levi; others [Pseudo Epiphanius], to that of Simeon. The inscription to Bel and the dragon in the Septuagint asserts the former; and Hab 3:19 perhaps favors this. Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 7.29] states that in his time Habakkuk's tomb was shown at Celia in Palestine.<p>The time seems to have been about 610 B.C. For the Chaldeans attacked Jerusalem in the ninth month of the fifth year of Jehoiakim, 605 B.C. (2Ki 24:1; 2Ch 36:6; Jer 46:2; 36:9). And Habakkuk (Hab 1:5, 6, &c.) speaks of the Chaldeans as about to invade Judah, but not as having actually done so. In the second chapter he proceeds to comfort his people by foretelling the humiliation of their conquerors, and that the vision will soon have its fulfilment. In the third chapter the prophet in a sublime ode celebrates the deliverances wrought by Jehovah for His people in times past, as the ground of assurance, notwithstanding all their existing calamities, that He will deliver them again. Hab 3:16 shows that the invader is still coming, and not yet arrived; so that the whole refers to the invasion in Jehoiakim's times, not those under Jehoiachin and Zedekiah. The Apocryphal appendix to Daniel states that he lived to see the Babylonian exile (588 B.C.), which accords with his prophesying early in Jehoiakim's reign, about 610 B.C.<p>The position of the book immediately after Nahum is appropriate; as Nahum treated of the judgments of the Lord on Assyria, for its violence against Israel, so Habakkuk, those inflicted by, and on, the Chaldeans for the same reason.<p>The style is poetical and sublime. The parallelisms are generally regular. Borrowed ideas occur (compare Hab 3:19, with Ps 18:33; Hab 2:6, with Isa 14:4; Hab 2:14, with Isa 11:9).<p>The ancient catalogues imply that his book is part of the canon of Scripture. In the New Testament, Ro 1:17 quotes Hab 2:4 (though not naming him); compare also Ga 3:11; Heb 10:38. Ac 13:40, 41 quotes Hab 1:5. One or two Hebrew words peculiar to Habakkuk occur (Hab 1:9; 2:6, 16).   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Hab 1:1-17.

This prophecy is called a "burden", or something took up and carried, being what the prophet received from the Lord, and went with to the people of the Jews, and was a heavy burdensome prophecy to them; declaring the calamities that should come upon them by the Chaldeans, who would invade their land, and carry them captive; and Habakkuk, that brought this account, is called a "prophet", to give the greater sanction to it; and it was what he had in vision from the Lord represented unto him, and therefore should be credited. Abarbinel inquires why Habakkuk should be called a prophet, when none of the lesser prophets are, excepting Haggai and Zechariah; and thinks the reason of it is, to give weight to his prophecy, since it might be suspected by some whether he was one; there being none of those phrases to be met with in this prophecy as in others, as "the word of the Lord came", &amp;c. or "thus saith the Lord". <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The burden which Habakkuk the prophet saw.</span><p>The Argument - The Prophet complains to God, considering the great felicity of the wicked, and the miserable oppression of the godly, who endure all types of affliction and cruelty, and yet can see no end. Therefore he had this revelation shown to him by God, that the Chaldeans would come and take them away as captives, so that they could look for no end of their troubles as yet, because of their stubbornness and rebellion against the Lord. And lest the godly should despair, seeing this horrible confusion, he comforts them by this, that God will punish the Chaldeans their enemies, when their pride and cruelty will be at height. And for this reason he exhorts the faithful to patience by his own example, and shows them a form of prayer, with which they should comfort themselves.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">The burden</span>] <span class="bld">the oracle</span>.

In the early times of prophecy the ecstasy or exalted condition of mind was more usual and the things revealed to the prophet were <span class="ital">seen</span> by him. Thus Micaiah ben Jimlah said: “I saw all Israel scattered upon the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd” <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm" title="And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, as sheep that have not a shepherd: and the LORD said, These have no master: let them return every man to his house in peace.">1 Kings 22:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-19.htm" title="And he said, Hear you therefore the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.">1 Kings 22:19</a>. In later times these terms “see,” “vision” and the like, which had been formed in the early period, continued to be retained, and any revelation was called a “vision,” and “see” was employed of the act of receiving a revelation, even when it was a word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm" title="The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.">Isaiah 2:1</a>).

This title, which is added in the inscriptions only to the names of Haggai and Zechariah, and cursorily to that of Jeremiah (46, 47, 50.), implies that he exercised the practical office of prophet, and was well known; and, as Pusey thinks, Habakkuk appended it here on account of the form in which his prophecy is cast, as being addressed almost entirely to God or the Chaldeans, not to his own people. <span class="cmt_word">Did see.</span> In prophetic vision (see note on Amos 1:1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The heading in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a> has been explained in the introduction. <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2-4</a> form the introduction to the prophet's address. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-2.htm">Micah 1:2</a>. "Hear, all ye nations: observe, O earth, and that which fills it: and let the Lord Jehovah be a witness against you, the Lord out of His holy palace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>. For, behold, Jehovah cometh forth from His place, and cometh down, and marcheth over the high places of the earth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>. And the mountains will melt under Him, and the valleys split, like wax before the fire, like water poured out upon a slope." The introductory words, "Hear, ye nations all," are taken by Micah from his earlier namesake the son of Imlah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>). As the latter, in his attack upon the false prophets, called all nations as witnesses to confirm the truth of his prophecy, so does Micah the Morashite commence his prophetic testimony with the same appeal, so as to announce his labours at the very outset as a continuation of the activity of his predecessor who had been so zealous for the Lord. As the son of Imlah had to contend against the false prophets as seducers of the nation, so has also the Morashtite (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm">Micah 2:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/3-5.htm">Micah 3:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-11.htm">Micah 3:11</a>); and as the former had to announce to both kingdoms the judgment that would come upon them on account of their sins, so has also the latter; and he does it by frequently referring to the prophecy of the elder Micah, not only by designating the false prophets as those who walk after the ru&#772;a&#774;ch and lie, sheqer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a>), which recals to mind the ru&#772;a&#774;ch sheqer of the prophets of Ahab (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22-23</a>), but also in his use of the figures of the horn of iron in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a> (compare the horns of iron of the false prophet Zedekiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-11.htm">1 Kings 22:11</a>), and of the smiting upon the cheek in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-14.htm">1 Kings 22:14</a>). &#8219;Amm&#305;&#772;m kulla&#770;m does not mean all the tribes of Israel; still less does it mean warlike nations. &#8219;Amm&#305;&#772;m never has the second meaning, and the first it has only in the primitive language of the Pentateuch. But here both these meanings are precluded by the parallel &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;&#1468;; for this expression invariably signifies the whole earth, with that which fills it, except in such a case as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/8-16.htm">Jeremiah 8:16</a>, where 'erets is restricted to the land of Israel by the preceding ha&#770;'a&#770;rets, or <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-19.htm">Ezekiel 12:19</a>, where it is so restricted by the suffix 'artsa&#770;h. The appeal to the earth and its fulness is similar to the appeals to the heaven and the earth in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-1.htm">Deuteronomy 32:1</a>. All nations, yea the whole earth, and all creatures upon it, are to hear, because the judgment which the prophet has to announce to Israel affects the whole earth (<a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>), the judgment upon Israel being connected with the judgment upon all nations, or forming a portion of that judgment. In the second clause of the verse, "the Lord Jehovah be witness against you," it is doubtful who is addressed in the expression "against you." The words cannot well be addressed to all nations and to the earth, because the Lord only rises up as a witness against the man who has despised His word and transgressed His commandments. For being a witness is not equivalent to witnessing or giving testimony by words, - say, for example, by the admonitory and corrective address of the prophet which follows, as C. B. Michaelis supposes, - but refers to the practical testimony given by the Lord in the judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a> ff), as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-5.htm">Malachi 3:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-5.htm">Jeremiah 42:5</a>. Now, although the Lord is described as the Judge of the world in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>, yet, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>., He only comes to execute judgment upon Israel. Consequently we must refer the words "to you" to Israel, or rather to the capitals Samaria and Jerusalem mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-1.htm">Micah 1:1</a>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> the suffix simply refers to the Nineveh mentioned in the heading, to which there has been no further allusion in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-2.htm">Nahum 1:2-7</a>. This view is also favoured by the fact that Micah summons all nations to hear his word, in the same sense as his earlier namesake in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>. What the prophet announces in word, the Lord will confirm by deed, - namely, by executing the predicted judgment, - and indeed "the Lord out of His holy temple," i.e., the heaven where He is enthroned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-4.htm">Psalm 11:4</a>); for (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-3.htm">1 Kings 22:3</a>) the Lord will rise up from thence, and striding over the high places of the earth, i.e., as unbounded Ruler of the world (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>), will come down in fire, so that the mountains melt before Him, that is to say, as Judge of the world. The description of this theophany is founded upon the idea of a terrible storm and earthquake, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-8.htm">Psalm 18:8</a>. The mountains melt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-9.htm">Psalm 68:9</a>) with the streams of water, which discharge themselves from heaven (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>), and the valleys split with the deep channels cut out by the torrents of water. The similes, "like wax," etc. (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-3.htm">Psalm 68:3</a>), and "like water," etc., are intended to express the complete dissolution of mountains and valleys. The actual facts answering to this description are the destructive influences exerted upon nature by great national judgments. </body></html>
