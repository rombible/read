We are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others, and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay the nations? - The prophet, like Isaiah Isa 18:4-5, stands at the very last point, before the fury and desire of the enemy was fulfilled. People, like fish, were gathered together for a prey; he who had taken them was rejoicing and exulting beforehand in his booty; his portion and meat were the choice of the earth; the prophet leeks on, as it were, and beholds the net full; there is but one step more; "Shall he empty it? Shall he then devour those whom he has caught? and so cast his emptied net again unceasingly, pitilessly, to slay the nations?" This question he answers in the next chapter - A Deliverer will come! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. Shall they &#8230; empty their net?&#8212;Shall they be allowed without interruption to enjoy the fruits of their violence?<p>therefore&#8212;seeing that they attribute all their successes to themselves, and not to Thee. The answer to the prophet's question, he by inspiration gives himself in the second chapter.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/habakkuk/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Shall they?</span> the Chaldeans, Nebuchadnezzar and his armies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore; </span> shall former success be pledge of future? they have prospered, and they think they shall; wilt thou confirm this to them? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Empty their net; </span> as fishermen empty the full net to fill it again, and cast out what they had taken to take in more; shall these proud and cruel Chaldeans do so still? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And not spare continually; </span> shall they as endlessly as mercilessly waste? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To slay, </span> murderer-like, kill, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the nations; </span> not single persons, but whole kingdoms and people at once: wilt thou, O most just and mighty God and Judge, suffer these things always? The prophet by the question intimates to us that God most certainly will not suffer it always. The Lord will in fit time arise and break the oppressors’ arm, and save the oppressed church and people of God. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/habakkuk/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Shall they therefore empty their net,.... Or "thus", after this manner, so Noldius; as fishermen do, when they have had a good cast, and a large draught, spread the net, and take out the fishes, in order to throw it again, and catch more; and so it is asked, should these Chaldeans, when they have conquered one nation, and so filled their net or themselves with the spoil, carry it to Babylon, and there lay it up, and then proceed to fight against another kingdom and nation, and plunder it in like manner? <p>and not spare continually to slay the nations? the inhabitants of them one after another, and subdue them under them, and make themselves master of all their treasure, until they are arrived to universal monarchy by such cruel and unmerciful methods. The Targum is, <p>"shall he send his armies continually to consume nations, and that without mercy?'' <p>This the prophet proposes in the name of the whole body of the Lord's people, and leaves it with him to have an answer to it, which is given in the following chapter <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare continually to slay <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> the nations?</span><p>(n) Meaning, that they would not.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>.

Shall they be permitted to be continually emptying their net in order to fill it again? The idea is that they carried off their booty and captives and secured them in their own territory, and then set out on new expeditions to acquire fresh plunder. The question is answered in the next chapter, where the judgment on the Chaldeans is pronounced. <span class="cmt_word">And not spare continually to slay the nations?</span> And cease not to send forth his armies and to found his empire in the blood of conquered nations. The Septuagint and Vulgate have no interrogation, the assertion being made by way of expostulation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Therefore thus saith Jehovah, Behold, I devise evil concerning this family, from which ye shall not withdraw your necks, and not walk loftily, for it is an evil time. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-4.htm">Micah 2:4</a>. In that day will men raise against you a proverb, and lament a lamentation. It has come to pass, they say; we are waste, laid waste; the inheritance of my people he exchanges: how does he withdraw it from me! To the rebellious one he divides our field." The punishment introduced with la&#770;khe&#772;n (therefore) will correspond to the sin. Because they reflect upon evil, to deprive their fellow-men of their possessions, Jehovah will bring evil upon this generation, lay a heavy yoke upon their neck, out of which they will not be able to necks, and under which they will not be able to walk loftily, or with extended neck. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1492; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1488;&#1514; is not this godless family, but the whole of the existing nation, whose corrupt members are to be exterminated by the judgment (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-20.htm">Isaiah 29:20</a>.). The yoke which the Lord will bring upon them is subjugation to the hostile conqueror of the land and the oppression of exile (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/27-12.htm">Jeremiah 27:12</a>). Ha&#770;lakh ro&#772;ma&#770;h, to walk on high, i.e., with the head lifted up, which is a sign of pride and haughtiness. Ro&#772;ma&#770;h is different from &#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1502;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, an upright attitude, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/27-13.htm">Leviticus 27:13</a>. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1514; &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-13.htm">Amos 5:13</a>, but in a different sense, is not used of moral depravity, but of the distress which will come upon Israel through the laying on of the yoke. Then will the opponents raise derisive songs concerning Israel, and Israel itself will bewail its misery. The verbs yissa&#770;', na&#770;ha&#770;h, and 'a&#770;mar are used impersonally. Ma&#770;sha&#770;l is not synonymous with neh&#305;&#772;, a mournful song (Ros.), but signifies a figurative saying, a proverb-song, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-4.htm">Isaiah 14:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-6.htm">Habakkuk 2:6</a>. The subject to &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; is the opponents of Israel, hence &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;; on the other hand, the subject to na&#770;ha&#770;h and 'a&#770;mar is the Israelites themselves, as &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; teaches. &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is not a feminine formation from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;, a mournful song, lamentum lamenti, i.e., a mournfully mournful song, as Rosenmller, Umbreit, and the earlier commentators suppose; but the niphal of &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-27.htm">Daniel 8:27</a>): actum est! it is all over! - an exclamation of despair (Le de Dieu, Ewald, etc.); and it is written after 'a&#770;mar, because &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; as an exclamation is equivalent in meaning to an object. The omission of the copula Vav precludes our taking 'a&#770;mar in connection with what follows (Maurer). The following clauses are a still further explanation of &#1504;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492;: we are quite laid waste. The form &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; is probably chosen simply to imitate the tone of lamentation better (Hitzig). The inheritance of my people, i.e., the land of Canaan, He (Jehovah) changes, i.e., causes it to pass over to another possessor, namely, to the heathen. The words receive their explanation from the clauses which follow: How does He cause (sc., the inheritance) to depart from me! Not how does He cause me to depart. &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489; is not an infinitive, ad reddendum, or restituendum, which is altogether unsuitable, but nomen verbale, the fallen or rebellious one, like &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-22.htm">Jeremiah 31:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-4.htm">Jeremiah 49:4</a>. This is the term applied by mourning Israel to the heathenish foe, to whom Jehovah apportions the fields of His people. The withdrawal of the land is the just punishment for the way in which the wicked great men have robbed the people of their inheritance. </body></html>
