We are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others, and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And makest men as the fishes of the sea - mute, helpless, in a stormy, restless element, no cry heard, but themselves swept away in shoals, with no power to resist.<p>As the creeping things - whether of the land (as it is mostly used), or the sea <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>.

That is, sufferest them to be used as the fishes of the sea, which are easily taken in the net, and are common to everyone; whosoever will may take them up, and kill them, and use them for their food; and which also among themselves are often hardly used, the lesser being devoured by the greater; and in like manner the prophet suggests, that the people of the Jews, who were men made after the image of God, and made for society and usefulness, and moreover were God's covenant people; and it might have been expected, that a more special providence would have attended them, more than other men, and especially than what attended the fishes of the sea; yet it looked as if there were no more care taken of them than of these: <p>as the creeping things that have no ruler over them; not the creeping things of the earth, but of the water, the lesser sort of fishes that move in the water; or those that more properly creep, as crabs, prawns, and shrimps; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a> who have none to protect and defend them, and restrain others from taking and hurting them: this may seem contrary to what Aristotle (d) and Pliny (e) say of some fishes, that they go in company, and have a leader or governor; but, as Bochart (f) observes, it is one thing to be a leader of the way, a guide and director, which way to steer their course in swimming; and another thing to be as the general of an army, to protect and defend, or under whose directions they might defend themselves; such an one the prophet denies they had: and so, the prophet complains, this was the case of the Jews; they were exposed to the cruelty of their enemies, as if there was no God that governed in the world, and no providence to direct and order things for the preservation of men, and to keep good men from being hurt by evil men; or those that were weak and feeble from being oppressed by the powerful and mighty; this he reasons with the Lord about, and was desirous of an answer to it. <p>(d) Hist.

At the last resort it is Jehovah who is the author of all this inhuman violence. Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm" title="The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covers the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?">Job 9:24</a>, “if not He, who then is it?” It might be that the Chaldeans were set to chastise, but they exceeded all bounds in their inhumanity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/47-6.htm" title="I was wroth with my people, I have polluted my inheritance, and given them into your hand: you did show them no mercy; on the ancient have you very heavily laid your yoke....">Isaiah 47:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zechariah/1-14.htm" title="So the angel that communed with me said to me, Cry you, saying, Thus said the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy....">Zechariah 1:14-15</a>).

So the Jews seem to be deprived of God's care, and left to be the prey of the spoiler, as if of little worth, and no longer having God for their King (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-19.htm">Isaiah 63:19</a>, Revised Version). The "creeping things" are worms, or small fish (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-25.htm">Psalm 104:25</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The violent acts of the great men would be punished by God with the withdrawal of the inheritance of His people, or the loss of Canaan. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-1.htm">Micah 2:1</a>. "Woe to those who devise mischief, and prepare evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning they carry it out, for their hand is their God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>. They covet fields and plunder; them, and houses and take them; and oppress the man and his house, the man and his inheritance." The woe applies to the great and mighty of the nation, who by acts of injustice deprive the common people of the inheritance conferred upon them by the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>). The prophet describes them as those who devise plans by night upon their beds for robbing the poor, and carry them out as soon as the day dawns. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; denotes the sketching out of plans (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>); and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1506;, to work evil, the preparation of the ways and means for carrying out their wicked plans. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, the preparation, is distinguished from &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, the execution, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, for which &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; are also used (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). "Upon their beds," i.e., by night, the time of quiet reflection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). "By the light of the morning," i.e., at daybreak, without delay. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, lit., "for their hand is for a god," i.e., their power passes as a god to them; they know of no higher power than their own arm; whatever they wish it is in their power to do (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>). Ewald and Rckert weaken the thought by adopting the rendering, "because it stands free in their hand;" and Hitzig's rendering, "if it stands in their hand," is decidedly false. K&#305;&#772; cannot be a conditional particle here, because the thought would thereby be weakened in a manner quite irreconcilable with the context. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> the evil which they plan by night, and carry out by day, is still more precisely defined. By force and injustice they seize upon the property (fields, houses) of the poor, the possessions which the Lord has given to His people for their inheritance. Cha&#770;mad points to the command against coveting (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14-17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-18.htm">Deuteronomy 5:18</a>). The second half of the verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>) contains a conclusion drawn from the first: "and so they practise violence upon the man and his property." Be&#772;th answers to bott&#305;&#772;m, and nacha&#774;la&#770;h to the Sa&#770;do&#772;th, as their hereditary portion in the land - the portion of land which each family received when Canaan was divided. </body></html>
