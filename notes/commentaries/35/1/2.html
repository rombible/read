No man scrupled doing wrong to his neighbour. We should long to remove to the world where holiness and love reign for ever, and no violence shall be before us. God has good reasons for his long-suffering towards bad men, and the rebukes of good men. The day will come when the cry of sin will be heard against those that do wrong, and the cry of prayer for those that suffer wrong. They were to notice what was going forward among the heathen by the Chaldeans, and to consider themselves a nation to be scourged by them. But most men presume on continued prosperity, or that calamities will not come in their days. They are a bitter and hasty nation, fierce, cruel, and bearing down all before them. They shall overcome all that oppose them. But it is a great offence, and the common offence of proud people, to take glory to themselves. The closing words give a glimpse of comfort.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>O Lord, how long shall I cry - Literally, "how long have I cried so intensely to Thee?"  Because it is always the cry of the creature to the One who alone can hear or help - its God. Of this cry the Prophet expresses that it had already lasted long. In that long past he had cried out to God but no change had come. There is an undefined past, and this still continues.<p>How long - as Asaph cries, "how long hast Thou been," and, it is implied, wilt Thou be "wroth against the prayer of Thy people?" as we should say," how long shall Thy wrath continue?" The words which the prophet uses relate to domestic strife and wrong between man and man; violence, iniquity, strife, contention <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-3.htm">Habakkuk 1:3</a>, nor are any of them used only of the oppression of a foreign enemy. Also, Habakkuk complains of injustice too strong for the law, and the perversion of justice <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-4.htm">Habakkuk 1:4</a>. And upon this, the sentence is pronounced. The enemy is to be sent for judgment and correction <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-12.htm">Habakkuk 1:12</a>. They are then the sins of Judah which the prophet rehearses before God, in fellow-suffering with the oppressed. God answers that they shall be removed, but by the punishment of the sinners.<p>Punishment does not come without sin, nor does sin endure without punishment. It is one object of the Old Testament to exhibit the connection between sin and punishment. Other prophets, as commissioned by God, first denounced the sins and then foretold the punishment of the impenitent. Habakkuk appeals to God's justice, as requiring its infliction. On this ground too this opening of the prophecy cannot be a complaint against the Chaldees, because their wrong would be no ground of the punishment which the prophet denounced, but the punishment itself, requiting wrong to man through human wrong.<p>Cyril: "The prophet considers the person of the oppressed, enduring the intolerable insolence and contumely of those accustomed to do wrong, and very skillfully doth he attest the unutterable lovingkindness of God, for he exhibits Him as very forbearing, though accustomed to hate wickedness, but that He doth not immediately bring judgment upon the offenders, he showed clearly, saying that so great is His silence and long-suffering, that there needeth a strong cry, in that some practice intolerable covetousness against others, and use an unbridled insolence against the weak, for his very complaints of God's endurance of evil attest the immeasurable loving kindness of God."<p>Cyril: "You may judge hence of the hatred of evil among the saints. For they speak of the woes of others as their own. So saith the most wise Paul <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>, who is weak and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not? and bade us <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-15.htm">Romans 12:15</a> weep with those who weep, showing that sympathy and mutual love are especially becoming to the saints."<p>The prophet, through sympathy or fellow-suffering with the sufferers, is as one of them. He cries for help, as himself needing it, and being in the misery, in behalf of which he prays. He says, "How long shall I cry?" standing, as it were, in the place of all, and gathering all their cries into one, and presenting them before God. It is the cry, in one, of all which is wronged to the God of Justice, of all suffering to the God of love. "When shall this scene of sin, and confusion, and wrong be at an end, and the harmony of God's creation be restored? How long shall evil not exist only, but prevail?" It is the cry of the souls under the altar <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/6-10.htm">Revelation 6:10</a>, "How long, O Lord, Holy and True, dost Thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?" It is the voice of the oppressed against the oppressor; of the Church against the world; weary of hearing the Lord's Name blasphemed, of seeing wrong set up on high, of holiness trampled underfoot. It is in its highest sense His Voice, who, to sanctify our longings for deliverance, said in the days of His Flesh <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-2.htm">Psalm 22:2</a>, "I cry in the daytime, but Thou hearest not."<p>Even cry out - aloud (it is the cry of anguish) Dion.: "We cry the louder, the more we cry from the heart, even without words; for not the moving of the lips, but the love of the heart sounds in the ears of God."<p>Even cry out unto Thee. - Whether as an exclamation or a continuance of the question, How long? The prophet gathered in one the prolonged cry of past and future. He had cried out; he should cry on, "Violence." He speaks as if the one word, jerked out, as it were, wrung forth from his inmost soul, was, "Violence," as if he said this one word to the God of justice and love. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/habakkuk/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2, 3. violence &#8230; Why dost thou show me iniquity?&#8212;Similar language is used of the Chaldeans (Hab 1:9, 13), as here is used of the Jews: implying, that as the Jews sinned by violence and injustice, so they should be punished by violence and injustice (Pr 1:31). Jehoiakim's reign was marked by injustice, treachery, and bloodshed (Jer 22:3, 13-17). Therefore the Chaldeans should be sent to deal with him and his nobles according to their dealings with others (Hab 1:6, 10, 11, 17).

The cry of wrong and injury though long continued has evoked no interposition of God, nor been met with any help. The prophet seems certainly to complain not only of injury which he sees around him, but which he suffers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-7.htm" title="Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud, but there is no judgment.">Job 19:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-8.htm" title="For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.">Jeremiah 20:8</a>). But it may be a question when he says “I” whether he does not make himself one with some class in Israel, namely, the godly, who are wronged by the wicked, or with Israel as a people, which suffers injury at the hands of a foreign oppressor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/habakkuk/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - 2. <span class="accented">The prophet complains to God of the iniquity of his own nation, and its consequence.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Shall I cry;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>. The Hebrew is taken to imply that the prophet had long been complaining of the moral depravity of Judah, and calling for help against it There is no reference here, as Ewald fancies, to acts of violence committed by the Chaldeans, who, in fact, are announced as coming to chastise the wickedness of the chosen people (ver. 6). <span class="cmt_word">And thou wilt not hear!</span> The continuance of evil unchecked is an anomaly in the prophet's eye; and, putting himself in the position of the righteous among the people, he asks how long this is to last. <span class="cmt_word">Even cry out unto thee of violence;</span> better, <span class="accented">I cry out unto thee, Violence</span>.

So the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Vociferabor ad te vim patiens.</span> But Habakkuk doubtless speaks in the person of the righteous, grieved at the wickedness he sees around, and the more perplexed as the Law led him to look for temporal rewards and punishments, if in the case of individuals, much more in that of the chosen nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26.htm">Leviticus 26</a>, <span class="accented">passim</span>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/micah/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>This judicial interposition on the part of God is occasioned by the sin of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a>.

And who Judah's high places? is it not Jerusalem? <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-6.htm">Micah 1:6</a>.

And all her stone images will be beaten to pieces, and all her lovers' gifts be burned with fire, and all her idols will I make into a waste: for she has gathered them of prostitute's hire, and to prostitute's hire shall they return." "All this" refers to the coming of Jehovah to judgment announced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/1-3.htm">Micah 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-4.htm">Micah 1:4</a>. This takes place on account of the apostasy and the sins of Israel. &#1489; (for) used to denote reward or wages, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>. Jacob and Israel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> are synonymous, signifying the whole of the covenant nation, as we may see from the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-5.htm">Micah 1:5</a> Jacob and not Israel is the epithet applied to the ten tribes in distinction from Judah. &#1502;&#1497;, who? - referring to the author. The apostasy of Israel originates with Samaria; the worship on the high places with Jerusalem. The capitals of the two kingdoms are the authors of the apostasy, as the centres and sources of the corruption which has spread from them over the kingdoms. The allusion to the ba&#770;mo&#772;th of the illegal worship of the high places, which even the most godly kings were unable to abolish (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-14.htm">1 Kings 15:14</a>), shows, moreover, that &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; denotes that religious apostasy from Jehovah which was formally sanctioned in the kingdom of the ten tribes by the introduction of the calf-worship. But because this apostasy commenced in the kingdom of the ten tribes, the punishment would fall upon this kingdom first, and Samaria would be utterly destroyed. Stone-heaps of the field and vineyard plantations harmonize badly, in Hitzig's view: he therefore proposes to alter the text. But there is no necessity for this. The point of comparison is simply that Samaria will be so destroyed, that not a single trace of a city will be left, and the site thereof will become like a ploughed field or plain. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492; is added to &#1506;&#1497;, a heap of ruins or stones, to strengthen it. Samaria shall become like a heap, not of ruins of building stones, but of stones collected from the field. &#1500;&#1502;&#1496;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497; &#1499;&#1512;&#1501;, i.e., into arable land upon which you can plant vineyards. The figure answers to the situation of Samaria upon a hill in a very fruitful region, which was well adapted for planting vineyards (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a>). The situation of the city helps to explain the casting of its stones into the valley. Laying bare the foundations denotes destruction to the very foundation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>). On the destruction of the city all its idols will be annihilated. Pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, idols, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-10.htm">Isaiah 10:10</a>; not wooden idols, however, to which the expression yukkattu&#772;, smitten to pieces, would not apply, but stone idols, from pa&#770;sal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-1.htm">Exodus 34:1</a>). By the lovers' gifts ('ethna&#770;n, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-1.htm">Hosea 9:1</a>) we are to understand, not "the riches of the city or their possessions, inasmuch as the idolaters regarded their wealth and prosperity as a reward from their gods, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-7.htm">Hosea 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>" (Rashi, Hitzig, and others), but the temple gifts, "gifts suspended in the temples and sacred places in honour of the gods" (Rosenmller), by which the temple worship with its apparatus were maintained; so that by 'ethna&#770;n we may understand the entire apparatus of religious worship. For the parallelism of the clauses requires that the word should be restricted to this. &#1506;&#1510;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; are also idolatrous images. "To make them into a waste," i.e., not only to divest them of their ornament, but so utterly to destroy them that the place where they once stood becomes waste. The next clause, containing the reason, must not be restricted to the &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m, as Hitzig supposes, but refers to the two clauses of the first hemistich, so that pes&#305;&#772;l&#305;&#772;m and &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m are to be supplied as objects to qibba&#770;tsa&#770;h (she gathered), and to be regarded as the subject to ya&#770;shu&#772;bhu&#772; (shall return). Samaria gathered together the entire apparatus of her idolatrous worship from prostitute's gifts (the wages of prostitution), namely, through gifts presented by the idolaters. The acquisition of all this is described as the gain of prostitute's wages, according to the scriptural view that idolatry was spiritual whoredom. There is no ground for thinking of literal wages of prostitution, or money which flowed into the temples from the voluptuous worship of Aphrodite, because Micah had in his mind not literal (heathenish) idolatry, but simply the transformation of the Jehovah-worship into idolatry by the worship of Jehovah under the symbols of the golden calves. These things return back to the wagers of prostitution, i.e., they become this once more (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-19.htm">Genesis 3:19</a>) by being carried away by the enemies, who conquer the city and destroy it, and being applied to their idolatrous worship. On the capture of cities, the idols and temple treasures were carried away (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-3.htm">Daniel 1:3</a>). </body></html>
