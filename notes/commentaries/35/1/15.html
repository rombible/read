We are an offending people, he is an offended God, yet we will not entertain hard thoughts of him, or of his service. It is great comfort that, whatever mischief men design, the Lord designs good, and we are sure that his counsel shall stand. Though wickedness may prosper a while, yet God is holy, and does not approve the wickedness. As he cannot do iniquity himself, so he is of purer eyes than to behold it with any approval. By this principle we must abide, though the dispensations of his providence may for a time, in some cases, seem to us not to agree with it. The prophet complains that God's patience was abused; and because sentence against these evil works and workers was not executed speedily, their hearts were the more fully set in them to do evil. Some they take up as with the angle, one by one; others they catch in shoals, as in their net, and gather them in their drag, their enclosing net. They admire their own cleverness and contrivance: there is great proneness in us to take the glory of outward prosperity to ourselves. This is idolizing ourselves, sacrificing to the drag-net because it is our own. God will soon end successful and splendid robberies. Death and judgment shall make men cease to prey on others, and they shall be preyed on themselves. Let us remember, whatever advantages we possess, we must give all the glory to God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/habakkuk/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They take up all of them - (literally "he taketh up all of it") the whole race as though it were one,<p>With an angle; they catch them - literally, he sweepeth it away<p>In their (his) net - One fisherman is singled out who partly by wiles (as by the bait of "an angle"), partly by violence (the net or drag) sweeps away  and gathers as his own the whole kind. Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldaeans are herein a faint image of Satan, who casts out his baits and his nets in the stormy sea of this life, taking some by individual craft, sweeping others in whole masses, to do evil; and whoso hath no ruler, and will not have Christ to reign over him <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/19-4.htm">Luke 19:4</a>, he allures, hurries, drags away as his prey. Jerome: "Adam clave to his hook, and he drew him forth out of Paradise with his net; and covered him with his drags, his varied and manifold deceits and guiles. And "by one many became sinners," and in Adam we 'all died,' and all saints afterward were with him alike cast out of Paradise.

The prophet continues the metaphor of fishing, and observes the different ways of taking fish; which is to be applied to the case he is speaking of: as fishermen take all they can with their angles, so "they" or "he", for it is in the singular number, Nebuchadnezzar and his army, take up all out of the sea of the world; are ambitious of getting all kingdoms and nations of the world under their power and dominion; particularly all Judea, and all the inhabitants of it, good and bad, without any distinction; for all were fish which came to their net: this may design the artful and alluring methods they first made use of to get the people into their hands, by making covenants with them, and drawing them into making of presents, and paying of tribute: <p>they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag; with the angle the fisherman catches fish one by one, but with the net great numbers; and what he misses by throwing the net, he gets by using the drag; all which may be expressive of the ways and methods used by the king of Babylon and his army, both in the times of Jeconiah, and of Zedekiah; under the former he used the net, and carried off large numbers, and with them the royal family and great substance, but left many behind; under the latter he came and swept away all, drained the land of its riches and its inhabitants: <p>therefore they rejoice and are glad; as fishermen do when they have good sport; so these people rejoiced in their own success, and in the calamities of their neighbours. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/habakkuk/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they rejoice and are glad.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/habakkuk/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">They take up … angle</span>] <span class="bld">He taketh up … with the hook; he sweepeth them into</span> (or, with) <span class="bld">his net</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they rejoice</span>] <span class="bld">he rejoiceth and exulteth</span>.

"Woe to those who devise mischief, and prepare evil upon their beds! In the light of the morning they carry it out, for their hand is their God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>. They covet fields and plunder; them, and houses and take them; and oppress the man and his house, the man and his inheritance." The woe applies to the great and mighty of the nation, who by acts of injustice deprive the common people of the inheritance conferred upon them by the Lord (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a>). The prophet describes them as those who devise plans by night upon their beds for robbing the poor, and carry them out as soon as the day dawns. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; denotes the sketching out of plans (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-5.htm">Psalm 36:5</a>); and &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1506;, to work evil, the preparation of the ways and means for carrying out their wicked plans. &#1508;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, the preparation, is distinguished from &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, the execution, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-4.htm">Isaiah 41:4</a>, for which &#1497;&#1510;&#1512; and &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; are also used (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/43-7.htm">Isaiah 43:7</a>). "Upon their beds," i.e., by night, the time of quiet reflection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/4-5.htm">Psalm 4:5</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-13.htm">Job 4:13</a>). "By the light of the morning," i.e., at daybreak, without delay. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, lit., "for their hand is for a god," i.e., their power passes as a god to them; they know of no higher power than their own arm; whatever they wish it is in their power to do (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-29.htm">Genesis 31:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/3-27.htm">Proverbs 3:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-11.htm">Habakkuk 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-6.htm">Job 12:6</a>). Ewald and Rckert weaken the thought by adopting the rendering, "because it stands free in their hand;" and Hitzig's rendering, "if it stands in their hand," is decidedly false. K&#305;&#772; cannot be a conditional particle here, because the thought would thereby be weakened in a manner quite irreconcilable with the context. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> the evil which they plan by night, and carry out by day, is still more precisely defined. By force and injustice they seize upon the property (fields, houses) of the poor, the possessions which the Lord has given to His people for their inheritance. Cha&#770;mad points to the command against coveting (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14-17</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-18.htm">Deuteronomy 5:18</a>). The second half of the verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a>) contains a conclusion drawn from the first: "and so they practise violence upon the man and his property." Be&#772;th answers to bott&#305;&#772;m, and nacha&#774;la&#770;h to the Sa&#770;do&#772;th, as their hereditary portion in the land - the portion of land which each family received when Canaan was divided. </body></html>
