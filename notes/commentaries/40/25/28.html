The abilities themselves cannot be thus transferred; the opportunities can, and often are, even in the approximate working out of the law of retribution which we observe on earth. Here also men give to him that hath, and faithful work is rewarded by openings for work of a higher kind. So, assuming a law, if not of continuity, at least of analogy, to work behind the veil, we may see in our Lord’s words that one form of the penalty of the slothful will be to see work which might have been theirs to do, done by those who have been faithful while on earth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-28.htm" title="Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents....">Matthew 25:28-29</a>. </span><span class="ital">Take therefore the talent from him </span>— Ye angels, the ministers of my will, take from him the blessing which he has thus abused, and <span class="ital">give it unto him which hath ten talents </span>— As a further token of my acceptance and favour. The master, who in disposing of the talents at first acted as an absolute owner and bountiful benefactor, now acts as a judge, and takes the talent from the unfaithful servant to punish him, and gives it to him that was eminently faithful, to reward him. And this may be applied, 1st, To any of the blessings of this life, such as wealth, honour, authority over others, health, strength, &c. Men are intrusted with these, that they may use them for the glory of God, and the good of their fellow-creatures: and he that conscientiously uses them for these ends, (which is signified in the next verse by <span class="ital">having </span>them; that is, having them to a good purpose,) shall have abundance, perhaps, of these things themselves, but if not, abundance of comfort in them, and of better things; <span class="ital">but from him that hath not </span>— That is, that hath these things as if he had them not, not doing good with them; they <span class="ital">shall be taken away. </span>Giving to the poor, and in other ways doing good with our talents, is trading with what we have, and the returns will be rich. The meal in the barrel, and the oil in the cruise will be multiplied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-14.htm" title="For thus said the LORD God of Israel, The barrel of meal shall not waste, neither shall the cruse of oil fail, until the day that the LORD sends rain on the earth.">1 Kings 17:14</a>; but those that are niggardly and uncharitable will find that those riches which are so acquired and hoarded, Will perish by <span class="ital">evil travail, </span>or are <span class="ital">kept by the owners thereof to their hurt, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/5-13.htm" title="There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt....">Ecclesiastes 5:13-14</a>. And it often happens that Providence strangely transfers property from those that do not do good with it to those that do. And other gifts and endowments are frequently taken from those who do not employ them according to the design of the great Master, and are given to others who are disposed to make a better use of them. 2d, We may apply it to the means of grace. They who are diligent in improving the opportunities and advantages they have, may expect to have them continued and increased; but they who know not and improve not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. In proof of this, see what God did first to Shiloh, and then to Jerusalem, and to the churches of the Lesser Asia, mentioned Revelation 2., 3. 3d, We may apply it to spiritual gifts. He that hath these, and doth good with them, shall retain them and find them greatly enlarged, for they will improve by exercise, and brighten by use: but as to those who <span class="ital">stir </span>not <span class="ital">up the gift that is in them, </span>who do not exert themselves according to their capacity, their gifts rust and decay, and die away like a neglected fire. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/25.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>25:14-30 Christ keeps no servants to be idle: they have received their all from him, and have nothing they can call their own but sin. Our receiving from Christ is in order to our working for him. The manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. The day of account comes at last. We must all be reckoned with as to what good we have got to our own souls, and have done to others, by the advantages we have enjoyed. It is not meant that the improving of natural powers can entitle a man to Divine grace. It is the real Christian's liberty and privilege to be employed as his Redeemer's servant, in promoting his glory, and the good of his people: the love of Christ constrains him to live no longer to himself, but to Him that died for him, and rose again. Those who think it impossible to please God, and in vain to serve him, will do nothing to purpose in religion. They complain that He requires of them more than they are capable of, and punishes them for what they cannot help. Whatever they may pretend, the fact is, they dislike the character and work of the Lord. The slothful servant is sentenced to be deprived of his talent. This may be applied to the blessings of this life; but rather to the means of grace. Those who know not the day of their visitation, shall have the things that belong to their peace hid from their eyes. His doom is, to be cast into outer darkness. It is a usual way of expressing the miseries of the damned in hell. Here, as in what was said to the faithful servants, our Saviour goes out of the parable into the thing intended by it, and this serves as a key to the whole. Let us not envy sinners, or covet any of their perishing possessions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The exchangers - The "exchangers" were persons who were in the habit of borrowing money, or receiving it on deposit at a low rate of interest, to be loaned to others at higher interest. They commonly sat by "tables" in the temple, with money ready to exchange or loan. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-12.htm">Matthew 21:12</a>. This money was left with the servant, not to exchange, nor to increase it by any such idle means, but by honest industry and merchandise; but since he was too indolent for that, he ought at least to have loaned it to the exchangers, that his master might have received some benefit from it.<p>With usury - With interest, increase, or gain. The word "usury," in our language, has a bad signification, meaning unlawful or exorbitant interest. This was contrary to the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36</a>.

This shows it was not special grace, which is intended by the talent; for the gift and calling of special grace are without repentance, and are that good part which shall not be taken away: but gifts may fail, cease, and vanish; they may be taken away from men, and men from them; a right arm may be clean dried up, and a right eye be utterly darkened: <p>and give it unto him which hath ten talents; for to diligent and laborious ministers of the word, more spiritual light and knowledge is given: but this is not to be understood, as though other men's gifts are, properly speaking, taken away from them, and bestowed on them; but that their gifts appear the more illustrious through the slothfulness of others. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/25.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Take therefore the talent from him, and give it unto him which hath ten talents.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/25.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/25-28.htm" title="Take therefore the talent from him, and give it to him which has ten talents....">Matthew 25:28-30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] because his conduct was so inexcusable.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-29.htm" title="For to every one that has shall be given, and he shall have abundance: but from him that has not shall be taken away even that which he has.">Matthew 25:29</a>.

For more minute and specific interpretations, all of them of a more or less arbitrary character, see Origen, Chrysostom, Theophylact.

He had left undone that which he ought to have done. <span class="cmt_word">Take therefore the talent from him.</span> The forfeiture of the talent was just and natural. It was given to him for a special purpose; he had not carried this out; therefore it could be his no longer. A limb unused loses its powers; grace unemployed is withdrawn. God's Spirit will not always strive with man. There comes a time when, if wilfully resisted and not exercised, it ceases to inspire and to influence. Well may we pray, "Take not thy Holy Spirit from us!" <span class="cmt_word">Give it,</span> etc. This is done on the principle stated in the next verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-12.htm">Matthew 13:12</a>. God's work must be done; his gifts are not lost; they are transferred to another who has proved himself worthy of such a charge. As the servant who had the ten talents lied already brought in his account and had received his reward, it seems, at first, difficult to understand how additional work and responsibility should be given to him. But it is the blessedness of Christ's servants that they rejoice in a new trust received, in added opportunities of serving him, whether in this life or in the life to come, and all the increase which they make is their own eternally and augments their joy. </body></html>
