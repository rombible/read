The mother of James and John (we find on comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>, that her name was Salome) was among those who “thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>); and probably the words so recently spoken, which promised that the Twelve should sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-28.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you, That you which have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.">Matthew 19:28</a>) had fastened on her thoughts, as on those of her sons, to the exclusion of those which spoke of suffering and death. And so, little mindful of the teaching of the parable they had just heard, they too expected that they should receive more than others, and sought (not, it may be, without some jealousy of Peter) that they might be nearest to their Lord in that “regeneration” which seemed to them so near. The mother came to ask for her sons what they shrank from asking for themselves, and did so with the act of homage (“worshipping Him”) which implied that she was speaking to a King.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him....">Matthew 20:20-23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then came to him the mother of Zebedee’s children </span>— Instigated, it seems, by them.

Jesus answered, <span class="ital">Ye know not what ye ask </span>— Ye are not aware what is implied in being advanced in my kingdom, and what is necessarily prerequired in order thereto.

That is, I can give the chief places in my kingdom to none but to those who, according to the immutable laws of my Father, are capable of occupying them. He applies to the glories of heaven what his disciples were so stupid as to understand of the glories of earth: but he does not deny that these are his to give. They are his to give in the strictest propriety, both as God, and as the Son of man.

Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Pride is a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdo others in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition of their request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings. It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but not the cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh 18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa 48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it is given, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquainted with the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desire of greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, but something of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours most diligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to his brethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ, and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks of his death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is a sacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantial sacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented. It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, if for many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35-45</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm">Matthew 20:20</a><p>Then came to him give mother of Zebedee's children ... - This was probably Salome, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm">Mark 16:1</a>.<p>With her sons - The names of these sons were James and John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-35.htm">Mark 10:35</a><p>Mark says they came and made the request.

Whose name was Salome, as may be concluded from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a> compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm">Mark 15:40</a>. She is not called the wife of Zebedee, who might be now dead, but the mother of his children, his two sons, as the Arabic version renders it: James and John, and who were the disciples of Christ: it is not certain, that Zebedee was ever a follower of him; and therefore the woman is described by her relation to her children, and not her husband; and the rather, because it was in their name, and on their account, that she came to Jesus. She is said to be the sister of Joseph, the husband of Mary, the mother of our Lord; and if so, might hope to succeed in her request, on the foot of relation; as also, since she herself had been a constant follower of, and attendant on him; and especially, inasmuch as her sons were his favourite disciples; <p>with her sons; her two sons, James and John, whom Mark mentions by name: <p>worshipping him, <p>and desiring a certain thing of him; that is, she came in a very submissive manner to him, either bowed unto him, or kneeled down before him, or threw herself at his feet, and signified that she had a single favour, and a very considerable one, to ask of him. Mark represents the case thus, that her two sons, James and John, came to Christ, and that they themselves spoke to him, and addressed him in this manner: "Master, we would that thou shouldest do for us, whatsoever we shall desire": which was a very odd request, both as to the matter and manner of it; that they should ask; and insist upon everything to be done for them, they desired; and suggest, that they expected that he would promise them this, before they declared the particular favour they had to ask of him. The matter may be reconciled thus. These two disciples, having observed what Christ had said concerning the twelve disciples sitting on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel, and what he had just related, concerning his rising again the third day, which they might understand of some display of his glory; and concluding from all this, that the setting up of his temporal monarchy was at hand, inform their mother of it, and move to her, to use her interest with Christ, in their favour: and which they did, partly to shun the envy and ill will of the rest of the disciples; and partly, to conceal their own pride and vanity; as also, they might think a request from her, on their behalf, would be more easily granted: accordingly, she agreeing to the motion, they all three came, as Matthew relates, and the mother is the mouth, and speaks for her sons; so that they may be said to make such a request by her, she representing them; or they joined in the petition with her; or as soon as she had made it, they seconded it, and made it their own. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{5}</span> Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children with her sons, worshipping <i>him</i>, and desiring a certain thing of him.</span><p>(5) The manner of the heavenly kingdom is quite contrary to the earthly kingdom.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/20.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-20.htm" title="Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.">Matthew 20:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τότε</span>] after the announcement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-17.htm" title="And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,...">Matthew 20:17-19</a>. <span class="ital">Salome</span>, His mother’s sister (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm" title="Now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleophas, and Mary Magdalene.">John 19:25</a>), was one of those women who were in the habit of accompanying Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm" title="Among which was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedees children.">Matthew 27:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-40.htm" title="There were also women looking on afar off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;">Mark 15:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-1.htm" title="And when the sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, had bought sweet spices, that they might come and anoint him.">Mark 16:1</a>.

Some have thought that she was the sister of the Virgin Mary, so interpreting <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-25.htm">John 19:25</a>. St. Mark makes the two apostles present their own request; and doubtless they put their mother forward, coming with her to the presence of Jesus, and using her agency in this somewhat delicate matter.

She did not at first make any definite request, but endeavoured to get Jesus to promise to grant her what she asked. According to St. Mark, the sons say plainly, "We would that thou shouldest do for us whatever we shall desire." Thus Bathsheba addressed David. "I desire one small petition of thee; I pray thee, say me not nay" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-20.htm">1 Kings 2:20</a>). Salome is plainly intending to ask some great thing. </body></html>
