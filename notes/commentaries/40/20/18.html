Jerusalem is to be the scene of His suffering, and their present journey is to end in it, and “the chief priests and scribes” are to be the chief actors in it, and “the Gentiles” are to be their instruments in it. The mocking, the spitting (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-34.htm" title="And they shall mock him, and shall whip him, and shall spit on him, and shall kill him: and the third day he shall rise again.">Mark 10:34</a>), the scourging, the crucifixion, all these are new elements in the prediction, as if what had before been presented in dim outline to the disciples was now brought vividly, in every stage of its progress, before His mind and theirs.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:17-19 Christ is more particular here in foretelling his sufferings than before. And here, as before, he adds the mention of his resurrection and his glory, to that of his death and sufferings, to encourage his disciples, and comfort them. A believing view of our once crucified and now glorified Redeemer, is good to humble a proud, self-justifying disposition. When we consider the need of the humiliation and sufferings of the Son of God, in order to the salvation of perishing sinners, surely we must be aware of the freeness and richness of Divine grace in our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold, we go up to Jerusalem - Jesus assured them that what they feared would come to pass, but he had, in some measure, prepared their minds for this state of suffering by the promises which he had made to them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/19-27.htm">Matthew 19:27-30</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-1.htm">Matthew 20:1-16</a>. In all their sufferings they might be assured that eternal rewards were before them.<p>Shall be betrayed - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-22.htm">Matthew 17:22</a>. "Unto the chief priests and scribes." The high priest, and the learned men who composed the Sanhedrin or the Great Council of the nation. He was thus betrayed by Judas, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-15.htm">Matthew 26:15</a>. He was delivered to the chief priests and scribes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-57.htm">Matthew 26:57</a>.<p>And they shall condemn him to death - They had not power to inflict death, as that power had been taken away by the Romans; but they had the power of expressing an opinion, and of delivering him to the Romans to be put to death. This they did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-66.htm">Matthew 26:66</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>.<p>Shall deliver him to the Gentiles - That is, because they have not the right of inflicting capital punishment, they will deliver him to those who have to the Roman authorities. The Gentiles here means Pontius Pilate and the Roman soldiers. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-2.htm">Matthew 27:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-27.htm">Matthew 27:27-30</a>.<p>To mock - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-16.htm">Matthew 2:16</a>.<p>To scourge - That is, to whip. This was done with thongs, or a whip made for the purpose, and this punishment was commonly inflicted upon criminals before crucifixion. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17</a>.<p>To crucify him - That is, to put him to death on a cross - the common punishment of slaves. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-31.htm">Matthew 27:31-32</a>.<p>The third day ... - For the evidence that this was fulfilled, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-15.htm">Matthew 28:15</a>. Mark and Luke say that he would be spit upon. Spitting on another has always been considered an expression of the deepest contempt. Luke says <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31</a>, "All things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man shall be accomplished." Among other things, he says he shall be "spitefully entreated;" that is, treated with spite or malice; malice, implying contempt. These sufferings of our Saviour, and this treatment, and his death, had been predicted in many places.

This is the last time of our going thither; observe, and take notice of what I am about to say; some extraordinary things will come to pass, and, as Luke relates that he said, <p>all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of man, shall be accomplished; everything that is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm">Psalm 22:1</a>, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>, or in any other prophecies of the Old Testament, relating to the ill treatment the Messiah should meet with, to his sufferings and death, and all the circumstances attending them, shall be exactly fulfilled in every point: and that they might not be at a loss about what he meant, he gives an account of various particular things, which should befall him; <p>and the Son of man shall be betrayed: he does not say by whom, though he knew from the beginning who should betray him, that it would be one of his disciples, and that it would be Judas; but the proper time was not yet come to make this discovery: the persons into whose hands he was to be betrayed, are mentioned; <p>unto the chief priests, and unto the Scribes; who were his most inveterate and implacable enemies; and who were the persons that had already taken counsel to put him to death, and were seeking all advantages and opportunities to execute their design: <p>and they shall condemn him to death; which is to be understood not of their declaring it as their opinion, that he was guilty of death, and ought to die by a law of their's, which declaration they made before Pilate; nor of their procuring the sentence of death to be pronounced by him, upon him; but of their adjudging him to death among themselves, in the palace of the high priest; which was done by them, as the sanhedrim and great council of the nation; though either they could not, or did not, choose to execute it themselves, and therefore delivered him up to the Romans; for this act of condemning him to death, was to be, and was, before the delivery of him up to the Gentiles, as is clear from what follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/20.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,</span><p>(3) They that should be persecuting him the least, are the greatest persecutors of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-18.htm" title="Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,">Matthew 20:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀναβαίνομεν</span>! a memorable fateful <span class="ital">anabasis</span>!
