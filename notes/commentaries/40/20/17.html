This would seem to have been followed by a return to Persea, and then the journey to Jerusalem begins. The account in St. Mark adds some significant facts. “Jesus went” (literally, <span class= "ital">was going</span>—implying continuance) “before them.” It was as though the burden of the work on which He was entering pressed heavily on His soul. The shadow of the cross had fallen on Him. He felt something of the conflict which reached its full intensity in Gethsemane, and therefore He needed solitude that He might prepare Himself for the sacrifice by communing with His Father; and instead of journeying with the disciples and holding “sweet converse” with them, went on silently in advance. This departure from His usual custom, and, it may be, the look and manner that accompanied it, impressed the disciples, as was natural, very painfully. “They were amazed, and as they followed, were afraid.” It was apparently as explaining what had thus perplexed them that He took the Twelve apart from the others that followed (including probably the Seventy and the company of devout women of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-2.htm" title="And certain women, which had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven devils,">Luke 8:2</a>) and told them of the nearness of His passion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/20.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/20-17.htm" title="And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples apart in the way, and said to them,...">Matthew 20:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus took the twelve disciples apart in the way </span>— See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/10-32.htm" title="And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem; and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed; and as they followed, they were afraid.

For, humanly speaking, it was much more probable that he should have been privately assassinated, or stoned, as was before attempted, by some zealous transport of popular fury, than that he should have been thus solemnly condemned, and delivered up to crucifixion; a Roman punishment, with which we do not find that he had ever been threatened.

And here, as before, he adds the mention of his resurrection and his glory, to that of his death and sufferings, to encourage his disciples, and comfort them. A believing view of our once crucified and now glorified Redeemer, is good to humble a proud, self-justifying disposition. When we consider the need of the humiliation and sufferings of the Son of God, in order to the salvation of perishing sinners, surely we must be aware of the freeness and richness of Divine grace in our salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/10-32.htm">Mark 10:32-34</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/18-31.htm">Luke 18:31-34</a>.<p>And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem - That is, doubtless, to the Passover. This journey was from the east side of Jordan. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1</a>. At this time he was on this journey to Jerusalem, probably not far from Jericho. This was his last journey to Jerusalem.

The roads, therefore, on such occasions, would probably be thronged. It is probable, also, that they would travel in companies, or that whole neighborhoods would go together. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-44.htm">Luke 2:44</a>. By his taking them apart is meant his taking them aside from the company. He had something to communicate which he did not wish the others to hear. Mark adds: "And Jesus went before them, and they were amazed; and as they followed they were sore afraid." He led the way. He had told them before <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-22.htm">Matthew 17:22</a> that he should be betrayed into the hands of people and be put to death. They began now to be afraid that this would happen, and to be solicitous for his life and for their own safety, and they were amazed at his boldness and calmness, and at his fixed determination to go up to Jerusalem in these circumstances.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 20:17-28.

Which was situated (f) in the highest part of the land of Israel: the land of Israel, is said to be higher than any other land whatever; and the temple at Jerusalem, higher than any part of the land of Israel; wherefore Christ's going to Jerusalem, is expressed by going up to it. Whither he came either from the coasts of Judea, from beyond Jordan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-1.htm">Matthew 19:1</a> where he had been some time healing diseases, disputing with the Pharisees, discoursing with the young ruler, and instructing his disciples; or from a country near to the wilderness, from a city called Ephraim, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-54.htm">John 11:54</a> where he continued some time with his disciples, after the sanhedrim had took counsel to put him to death; for this was his last journey to Jerusalem. <p>Took the twelve disciples apart in the way: into some private place, which lay near the road; for it seems that there were others that followed him, besides the twelve; when he was not willing they should hear what he had to say to them, concerning the issue of this, journey; lest either they should be discouraged and desert him, or it should be made public, and methods be used to prevent it: and said unto them; the disciples, whom he thought fit once more to remind of his sufferings and death, and to prepare them for the same; and though they would not so thoroughly understand all that he should say, yet when it was come to pass, they would remember it, and which would be of service to confirm their faith in him, as the true Messiah.
