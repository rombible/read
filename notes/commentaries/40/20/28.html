The Son of Man seemed to the beloved disciple never to have shown Himself so truly king like and divine as when engaged in that menial act. But that act, we must remember, was only an illustration; and the words found their true meaning in His whole life, in His poverty and humiliation, in the obedience of childhood, in service rendered, naturally or super-naturally, to the bodies or the souls of others.<p><span class= "bld">To give his life a ransom for many.</span>—The word rightly rendered “ransom,” is primarily “a price made for deliverance,” and in this sense it is found in the Greek version of the Old Testament for “the ransom” which is accepted instead of a man’s life in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>, for the “price of redemption” accepted as an equivalent for an unexpired term of service in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-50.htm" title="And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him to the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according to the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.">Leviticus 25:50</a>, for riches as the “ransom of a man’s life” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-8.htm" title="The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor hears not rebuke.">Proverbs 13:8</a>. No shade of doubt accordingly rests on the meaning of the word. Those who heard could attach no other meaning to it than that He who spake them was about to offer up His life that others might be delivered. Seldom, perhaps, has a truth of such profound import been spoken, as it were, so incidentally. It is as if the words had been drawn from Him by the contrast between the disputes of the disciples and the work which had occupied His own thoughts as He walked on in silent solitude in advance of them. It is the first distinct utterance, we may note, of the plan and method of His work. He had spoken before of “saving” the lost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-11.htm" title="For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.">Matthew 18:11</a>): now He declares that the work of “salvation” was to be also one of “redemption.” It could only be accomplished by the payment of a price, and that price was His own life. The language of the Epistles as to the “redemption that is in Christ Jesus,” our being “bought with a price” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm" title="For you are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's.">1Corinthians 6:20</a>), “redeemed by His precious blood” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-19.htm" title="But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot:">1Peter 1:19</a>), the language of all Christendom in speaking of the Christ as our Redeemer, are the natural developments of that one pregnant word. The extent of the redemptive work, “for many,” is here indefinite rather than universal, but “the ransom for all” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a> shows in what sense it was received by those whom the Spirit of God was guiding into all truth. Even the preposition in, “for many” has a more distinct import than is given in the English version. It was, strictly speaking, a “ransom” <span class= "ital">instead of, in the place of, </span>(<span class= "greekheb">ἀντὶ</span> not <span class= "greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span>) “many.” Without stating a theory of the atonement, it implied that our Lord’s death was, in some way, representative and vicarious; and the same thought is expressed by St. Paul’s choice of the compound substantive <span class= "greekheb">ἀντίλυτρον</span>, when, using a different preposition, he speaks of it as a ransom for (<span class= "greekheb">ὑπὲρ</span>,<span class= "ital"> i.e., on behalf of</span>) all men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm" title="Who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.">1Timothy 2:6</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:20-28 The sons of Zebedee abused what Christ said to comfort the disciples. Some cannot have comforts but they turn them to a wrong purpose. Pride is a sin that most easily besets us; it is sinful ambition to outdo others in pomp and grandeur. To put down the vanity and ambition of their request, Christ leads them to the thoughts of their sufferings. It is a bitter cup that is to be drunk of; a cup of trembling, but not the cup of the wicked. It is but a cup, it is but a draught, bitter perhaps, but soon emptied; it is a cup in the hand of a Father, Joh 18:11. Baptism is an ordinance by which we are joined to the Lord in covenant and communion; and so is suffering for Christ, Eze 20:37; Isa 48:10. Baptism is an outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace; and so is suffering for Christ, for unto us it is given, Php 1:29. But they knew not what Christ's cup was, nor what his baptism. Those are commonly most confident, who are least acquainted with the cross. Nothing makes more mischief among brethren, than desire of greatness. And we never find Christ's disciples quarrelling, but something of this was at the bottom of it. That man who labours most diligently, and suffers most patiently, seeking to do good to his brethren, and to promote the salvation of souls, most resembles Christ, and will be most honoured by him to all eternity. Our Lord speaks of his death in the terms applied to the sacrifices of old. It is a sacrifice for the sins of men, and is that true and substantial sacrifice, which those of the law faintly and imperfectly represented. It was a ransom for many, enough for all, working upon many; and, if for many, then the poor trembling soul may say, Why not for me?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even as the Son of man ... - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-20.htm">Matthew 8:20</a>. Jesus points them to his own example. He was in the form of God in heaven, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>. He came to people in the form of a servant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>. He came not with pomp and glory, but as a man in humble life; and since he came he had not required them to minister to him. "He labored for them." He strove to do them good. He provided for their needs; fared as poorly as they did; went before them in dangers and sufferings; practiced self-denial on their account, and for them was about to lay down his life. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-4.htm">John 13:4-5</a>.<p>To give his life a ransom for many - The word "ransom" means literally a price paid for the redemption of captives. In war, when prisoners are taken by an enemy, the money demanded for their release is called a ransom; that is, it is the means by which they are set at liberty. So anything that releases anyone from a state of punishment, or suffering, or sin, is called a ransom. People are by nature captives to sin. They are sold under it. They are under condemnation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm">Ephesians 2:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm">Romans 3:9-20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-23.htm">Romans 3:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/5-19.htm">1 John 5:19</a>. They are under a curse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-10.htm">Galatians 3:10</a>. They are in love with sin They are under its withering dominion, and are exposed to death eternal, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/9-17.htm">Psalm 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-6.htm">Psalm 11:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-2.htm">Psalm 68:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/139-19.htm">Psalm 139:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-6.htm">Romans 2:6-9</a>. They must have perished unless there had been some way by which they could he rescued. This was done by the death of Jesus - by giving his life a ransom. The meaning is, that he died in the place of sinners, and that God was willing to accept the pains of his death in the place of the eternal suffering of the redeemed. The reasons why such a ransom was necessary are:<p>1. that God had declared that the sinner shall die; that is, that he would punish, or show his hatred to, all sin.<p>2. that all people had sinned, and, if justice was to take its regular course, all must perish.<p>3. that man could make no atonement for his own sins. All that he could do, were he holy, would be only to do his duty, and would make no amends for the past. Repentance and future obedience would not blot away one sin.<p>4. No man was pure, and no angel could make atonement. God was pleased, therefore, to appoint his only-begotten Son to make such a ransom.

Theol</span>. 1863, p. 222 ff., defines <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span> as meaning something given by way of equivalent in order <span class="ital">to avert</span> death; this, however, is not sufficient, for, throughout the Sept. also, in which כפר is rendered by <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm" title="Moreover you shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death.">Numbers 35:31</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-35.htm" title="He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though you give many gifts.">Proverbs 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-8.htm" title="The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor hears not rebuke.">Proverbs 13:8</a>), pretium redemtionis is found to be the specific meaning given to the word, although the connection may sometimes admit ex adjuncto the additional idea of something given for the purpose of averting death. The Sept. likewise adheres to the same meaning in cases where other expressions are rendered by <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span>, such as גְּאֻלָּה (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-24.htm" title="And in all the land of your possession you shall grant a redemption for the land.">Leviticus 25:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-51.htm" title="If there be yet many years behind, according to them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.">Leviticus 25:51</a>), הַפְּדֻיִם (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/3-51.htm" title="And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed to Aaron and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses.">Numbers 3:51</a>), פִּדְזו (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-30.htm" title="If there be laid on him a sum of money, then he shall give for the ransom of his life whatever is laid on him.">Exodus 21:30</a>), מְחִיר (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-13.htm" title="I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my captives, not for price nor reward, said the LORD of hosts.">Isaiah 45:13</a>). Ritschl interprets our present passage as follows: “I am come to give away my life to God in sacrifice, that I may become the substitute of those who could never hope to succeed in finding, either for themselves or others, any adequate ransom as a means of securing their exemption from death; but the substitute only of those who, through faith and self-denying devotion to my person, fulfil the condition on which alone the ransom furnished by me can procure the hoped for exemption,” p. 238.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/20.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὤσπερ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ</span> in Mk.; both phrases introducing reference to the <span class="ital">summum exemplum</span> (Bengel) in an emphatic way.—<span class="greekheb">περ</span> lends force to <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> = even as, observe.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ὑ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπου</span>: an important instance of the use of the title. On the principle of defining by discriminating use it means: the man who makes no pretensions, asserts no claims.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἦλθε</span> points to the chief end of His mission, the general character of His public life: not that of a <span class="ital">Pretender</span> but that of a <span class="ital">Servant</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δοῦναι τὴν ψυχὴν</span>, to give His life, to that extent does the service go. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm" title="And being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, and became obedient to death, even the death of the cross.">Php 2:8</a> : <span class="greekheb">μέχρι θανάτου</span>, there also in illustration of the humility of Christ. It is implied that in some way the death of the Son of Man will be serviceable to others. It enters into the life plan of the Great Servant.—<span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span>, a ransom, characterises the service, another new term in the evangelic vocabulary, suggesting rather than solving a theological problem as to the significance of Christ’s death, and admitting of great variety of interpretation, from the view of Origen and other Fathers, who regarded Christ’s death as a price paid to the <span class="ital">devil</span> to ransom men from bondage to him, to that of Wendt, who finds in the word simply the idea that the example of Jesus in carrying the principle of service as far as to die tends by way of moral influence to deliver men’s minds from every form of spiritual bondage (<span class="ital">Die Lehre Jesu</span>, ii. 510–517). It is an interesting question, What clue can be found in Christ’s own words, as hitherto reported, to the use by Him on this occasion of the term <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span>, and to the sense in which He uses it? Wendt contends that this is the best method of getting at the meaning, and suggests as the most congenial text <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest....">Matthew 11:28-30</a>. I agree with him as to method, but think a better clue may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-27.htm" title="Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go you to the sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first comes up; and when you have opened his mouth, you shall find a piece of money: that take, and give to them for me and you.">Matthew 17:27</a>, the word spoken by Jesus in reference to the <span class="ital">Temple Tax</span>. That word <span class="ital">began</span> the striking course of instruction on humility, as this word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-28.htm" title="Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.">Matthew 20:28</a>) <span class="ital">ends</span> it, and the end and the beginning touch in thought and language. The <span class="ital">didrachmon</span> was a <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-12.htm" title="When you take the sum of the children of Israel after their number, then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul to the LORD, when you number them; that there be no plague among them, when you number them.">Exodus 30:12</a>), as the life of the Son of Man is represented to be. The tax was paid <span class="greekheb">ἀυτὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ</span>. The life is to be given <span class="greekheb">ἀντὶ πολλῶν</span>. Is it too much to suppose that the Capernaum incident was present to Christ’s mind when He uttered this striking saying, and that in the earlier utterance we have the key to the psychological history of the term <span class="greekheb">λύτρον</span>? On this subject <span class="ital">vide</span> my book <span class="ital">The Kingdom of God</span>, pp. 238–241.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/20.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">a ransom</span>]=the price paid for the redemption of a captive from slavery.

He took upon himself the form of a servant, and was ever active in ministering to others' wants, going about doing good, healing the sick, cleansing lepers, casting out demons; always accessible, sympathetic, merciful; never weary of teaching, however fatigued in body; a servant to the race which he came to save. <span class="cmt_word">A ransom for many;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>: <span class="accented">instead of many</span>. The crowning example of his humility is that he gave his life as a ransom for the souls of men. This is the atonement, the sacrificial act, which (as the Mosaic sacrifices did in a partial and temporary manner) reconciled God and man. Whatever may be the way in which this atonement acts on the Divine mind, the expression here shows that it was vicarious and propitiatory, energizing, not by example, as an effort of superhuman self-denial, courage, and patience, but by an inherent power, as mysterious as it is efficacious. We can only say that, being the act of one who is God, its effects must necessarily be incomprehensible and infinite. The difficulties that beset this doctrine are increased by the fact that Jesus himself says little about the atoning nature of his sufferings and death - a topic which would not at this time have been properly received by friends or enemies, the former refusing to credit his approaching death, the latter being totally unable to conceive how such death could supersede Jewish sacrifices and reconcile the whole world to God (Sadler). Christ certainly died for all, as St. Paul says, "He gave himself a ransom for all (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f72;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>)" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>), but all do not accept the offered salvation; hence arise the two expressions, "all" and "many," referring to the same object; "not," as an old Father says, "that salvation is limited, but men's efforts to obtain it are limited." The same expression was used by our Lord at the Last Supper, when he said, "This is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-28.htm">Matthew 26:28</a>). A comparison of the passages in which the death of Christ is connected with the salvation of men would show a similar interchange of terms, depending on the view which the writer is taking of the doctrine, whether an objective one or a subjective. In the former case we may cite <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-15.htm">Romans 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-14.htm">2 Corinthians 5:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-6.htm">1 Timothy 2:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-2.htm">1 John 2:2</a>; in the latter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-25.htm">Romans 3:25, 26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-2.htm">Ephesians 5:2</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/20.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A ransom for many<p>Compare Sophocles, "Oed.
