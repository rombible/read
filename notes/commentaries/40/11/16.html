They form themselves into companies, and get up a dramatic representation of wedding festivities and funeral pomp. They play their pipes, and expect others to dance; they beat their breasts in lamentation, and expect others to weep. They complain if others do not comply with their demands. To such a company our Lord likens the evil generation in which He and the Baptist lived. They were loud in their complaints of the Baptist because he would not share their self-indulgent mirth; they were bitter against Jesus because He would not live according to the rules of their hypocritical austerity. Thus interpreted, the whole passage is coherent. The more common explanation inverts the comparison, and sees in our Lord and the Baptist those who invite to mourning and to mirth respectively, and are repelled by their sullen playmates. This would in itself give an adequate meaning, but it does not fall in with our Lord’s language, which specifically identifies the children who invite <span class= "ital">the others</span> (this rather than “their fellows,” is the true reading) with the “generation” which He condemns. The verses that follow, giving the language in which the same generation vented its anger and scorn against the two forms of holiness, agree better with the interpretation here adopted.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/11.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation?

They are like those froward children, of whom their fellows complain that they will be pleased no way. <span class="ital">Saying, We have piped unto you, </span>&c. — “It was usual in Judea, at feasts, to have music of an airy kind, accompanied with dancing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm" title="Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.">Luke 15:25</a>; and at funerals, melancholy airs, to which were joined the lamentations of persons hired for that purpose. The children, therefore, in that country, imitating these things in their diversions, while one band of them performed the musical part, if the other, happening to be froward, would not answer them by dancing or lamenting, as the game directed, it naturally gave occasion to this complaint, <span class="ital">We have piped, </span>&c, which at length was turned into a proverb.” <span class="ital">John came neither eating nor drinking — </span>In a rigorous, austere way, like Elijah. <span class="ital">And they say, He hath a devil </span>— He is melancholy from the influence of an evil spirit. So, it is probable, the Pharisees in particular said. <span class="ital">The Son of man came eating and drinking </span>— Conversing in a free, familiar way. <span class="ital">And they say, Behold a man gluttonous, </span>&c. — Jesus did not practise those mortifications which rendered the Baptist remarkable. He fared like other men, and went into mixed companies, not avoiding the society even of publicans and sinners, but neither would they hear him; for, notwithstanding he maintained the strictest temperance himself, and never encouraged the vices of others, either by dissimulation or example, they attributed that free way of living to a certain laxness of principle, or unholiness of disposition. <span class="ital">But wisdom is justified of her children </span>— That is, my wisdom herein is acknowledged by all those who are truly wise, and all such will justify all God’s dispensations toward them in order to their salvation, and will entirely acquiesce therein.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:16-24 Christ reflects on the scribes and Pharisees, who had a proud conceit of themselves. He likens their behaviour to children's play, who being out of temper without reason, quarrel with all the attempts of their fellows to please them, or to get them to join in the plays for which they used to assemble. The cavils of worldly men are often very trifling and show great malice. Something they have to urge against every one, however excellent and holy. Christ, who was undefiled, and separate from sinners, is here represented as in league with them, and polluted by them. The most unspotted innocence will not always be a defence against reproach. Christ knew that the hearts of the Jews were more bitter and hardened against his miracles and doctrines, than those of Tyre and Sidon would have been; therefore their condemnation would be the greater. The Lord exercises his almighty power, yet he punishes none more than they deserve, and never withholds the knowledge of the truth from those who long after it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But whereunto shall I liken ... - Christ proceeds to reprove the inconsistency and fickleness of that age of people. He says they were like children - nothing pleased them. He refers here to the "plays" or "sports" of children. Instrumental music, or piping and dancing, were used in marriages and festivals as a sign of joy. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-11.htm">Isaiah 5:11-12</a>. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-11.htm">Job 21:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-14.htm">2 Samuel 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-25.htm">Luke 15:25</a>. Children imitate their parents and others, and act over in play what they see done by others. Among their childish sports, therefore, was probably an imitation of a wedding or festal occasion. We have seen also (the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm">Matthew 9:23</a>) that funerals were attended with mournful music, and lamentation, and howling. It is not improbable that children also, in play: imitated a mournful funeral procession. One part are represented as sullen and dissatisfied. They would not enter into the play: nothing pleased them. The others complained of it. We have, said they, taken all pains to please you. We have piped to you, have played lively tunes, and have engaged in cheerful sports, but you would not join with us; and then we have played different games, and imitated the mourning at funerals, and you are equally sullen; "you have not lamented;" you have not joked with us. Nothing pleases you. So, said Christ, is this generation of people. "John" came one way, "neither eating nor drinking," abstaining as a Nazarite, and you were not pleased with him. I, the Son of man, have come in a different manner, "eating and drinking;" not practicing any austerity, but living like other people, and you are equally dissatisfied - nay, you are less pleased. You calumniate him, and abuse me for not doing the very thing which displeased you in John. Nothing pleases you. You are fickle, changeable, inconstant, and abusive.<p>Markets - Places to sell provisions; places of concourse, where also children flocked together for play.<p>We have piped - We have played on musical instruments. A "pipe" was a wind instrument of music often used by shepherds.<p>Neither eating nor drinking - That is, abstaining from some kinds of food and wine, as a Nazarite. It does not mean that he did not eat at all, but that he was remarkable for abstinence.<p>He hath a devil - He is actuated by a bad spirit. He is irregular, strange, and cannot be a good man.<p>The Son of man came eating and drinking - That is, living as others do; not practicing austerity; and they accuse him of being fond of excess, and seeking the society of the wicked.<p>Gluttonous - One given to excessive eating.<p>Wine-bibber - One who drinks much wine. Jesus undoubtedly lived according to the general customs of the people of his time. He did not affect singularity; he did not separate himself as a Nazarite; he did not practice severe austerities. He ate that which was common and drank that which was common. As wine was a common article of beverage among the people, he drank it. It was the pure juice of the grape, and for anything that can be proved, it was without fermentation. In regard to the kind of wine which was used, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-10.htm">John 2:10</a>. No one should plead the example, at any rate, in favor of making use of the wines that are commonly used in this country - wines, many of which are manufactured here, and without a particle of the pure juice of the grape, and most of which are mixed with noxious drugs to give them color and flavor.<p>Wisdom is justified of her children - The children of wisdom are the wise - those who understand. The Saviour means that though that generation of Pharisees and fault-finders did not appreciate the conduct of John and himself, yet the "wise," the candid - those who understood the reasons of their conduct - would approve of and do justice to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a> ff. After this high testimony respecting the <span class="ital">Baptist</span>, we have now a painful charge against the <span class="ital">men of his time</span>, whom, in fact, neither John nor Himself is able to satisfy. In expressive, appropriate, and certainly original terms (in answer to Hilgenfeld), He compares the existing generation to children reproaching their playfellows for not being inclined to chime in either with their merry or their lugubrious strains. <span class="ital">Usually</span> the <span class="ital">Jews</span> are supposed to be represented by those refractory playmates, so that <span class="ital">Jesus and John</span> have necessarily to be understood as corresponding to the children who play the cheerful music, and who mourn (Fritzsche, Oppenrieder, Köster in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1862, p. 346 f.). But (1) the words expressly intimate that the children with their music and lamentation represented the <span class="greekheb">γενεά</span>, to which John and Jesus <span class="ital">stand opposed</span>, so that the latter must therefore correspond to the <span class="greekheb">ἑτέροις</span> who are reproached by the <span class="greekheb">παιδία</span>. (2) If the arrangement of the passage is not to be arbitrarily disturbed, the thrice repeated <span class="greekheb">λέγουσιν</span> must be held to prove that, since those who speak in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-18.htm" title="For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil....">Matthew 11:18-19</a> are <span class="ital">Jews</span>, it is to <span class="ital">these</span> also that the children correspond who are introduced as speaking in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-16.htm" title="But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like to children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,">Matthew 11:16</a>. (3) If we were to suppose that Jesus and John were represented by those children, then, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/11-18.htm" title="For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He has a devil....">Matthew 11:18-19</a>, it would be necessary to reverse the order of the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-17.htm" title="And saying, We have piped to you, and you have not danced; we have mourned to you, and you have not lamented.">Matthew 11:17</a>, so as to run thus: <span class="greekheb">ἐθρηνήσαμεν ὑμῖν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ηὐλήσαμεν</span>, etc. Consequently the ordinary explanation of the illustration is wrong. The correct interpretation is this: <span class="ital">the</span> <span class="greekheb">παιδία</span> <span class="ital">are the Jews; the</span> <span class="greekheb">ἕτεροι</span> <span class="ital">are John and Jesus;</span> first came John, who was far too rigid an ascetic to suit the tastes of the free-living Jews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>); then came Jesus, and He, again, did not come up to their ascetic and hierarchical standard, and was too lax, in their opinion. The former did not dance to their music; the latter did not respond to their lamentation (similarly de Wette with a slight deviation, Ewald, Bleek, Keim).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">παιδίοις</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] The allusion is to children who in their play (according to Ewald, it was playing at a <span class="ital">riddle</span>) imitate the way in which grown-up people give expression to their joy and their sorrow; Rosenmüller, <span class="ital">Morgenl. in loco</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">flute was played</span> at weddings and dancings.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκόψασθε</span>] beating upon the breast was the ordinary indication of <span class="ital">grief;</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-43.htm" title="And there shall you remember your ways, and all your doings, wherein you have been defiled; and you shall loathe yourselves in your own sight for all your evils that you have committed.">Ezekiel 20:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm" title="But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall flee away.

It is advisable not to assume as a matter of course that these words were spoken at the same time as those going before. The discourse certainly appears continuous, and Luke gives this utterance in the same connection as our evangelist, from which we may infer that it stood so in the common source. But even there the connection may have been topical rather than temporal; placed beside what goes before, because containing a reference to John, and because the contents are of a critical nature.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>. <span class="ital">But whereunto shall I liken this generation?</span>] The children who complain of their companions are the Jews who are satisfied neither with Jesus nor with John.

For <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> in an illustrative saying one has chiefly to regard its general sense; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> in vers. 18, 19 the action of John and of our Lord in "coming" corresponds to the activity of the children; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> this interpretation seems much more in accordance with the context. The verses are therefore to be understood as meaning- John mourned in urging repentance, our Lord rejoiced in gospel liberty and preaching, but both alike were only ridiculed by the Jews. <span class="accented">Markets</span>; <span class="accented">marketplaces</span> (Revised Version); for there is no thought of the children helping their elders in traffic. <span class="accented">And calling</span> (<span class="accented">which call</span>, Revised Version) <span class="accented">unto their fellows.</span> Addressing them, but not necessarily noisily (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-13.htm">Luke 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-12.htm">Luke 13:12</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/11.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Children (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Diminutive, little children. The Rev. Donald Fraser gives the picture simply and vividly: "He pictured a group of little children playing at make-believe marriages and funerals. First they acted a marriage procession; some of them piping as on instruments of music, while the rest were expected to leap and dance. In a perverse mood, however, these last did not respond, but stood still and looked discontented. So the little pipers changed their game and proposed a funeral. They began to imitate the loud wailing of eastern mourners. But again they were thwarted, for their companions refused to chime in with the mournful cry and to beat their breasts....So the disappointed children complained: 'We piped unto you and ye did not dance; we wailed, and ye did not mourn. Nothing pleases you. If you don't want to dance, why don't yon mourn?...It is plain that yon are in bad humor, and determined not to be pleased'" ("Metaphors in the Gospels").

Wyc., renders cheepynge; compare cheepside, the place for buying selling; for the word cheap had originally no reference to small price, but meant simply barter or price. The primary conception in the Greek word has nothing to do with buying and selling. &#x391;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769; is an assembly; then the place of assembly. The idea of a place of trade comes in afterward, and naturally, since trade plants itself where people habitually gather. Hence the Roman Forum was devoted, not only to popular and judicial assemblies, but to commercial purposes, especially of bankers. The idea of trade gradually becomes the dominant one in the word. In Eastern cities the markets are held in bazaars and streets, rather than in squares. In these public places the children would be found playing.
