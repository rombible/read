A warning was needed, but it was given in the form of a beatitude which it was still open to him to claim and make his own. Not to find a stumbling-block in the manner in which the Christ had actually come, that was the condition of entering fully into the blessedness of His kingdom.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:2-6 Some think that John sent this inquiry for his own satisfaction. Where there is true faith, yet there may be a mixture of unbelief. The remaining unbelief of good men may sometimes, in an hour of temptation; call in question the most important truths. But we hope that John's faith did not fail in this matter, and that he only desired to have it strengthened and confirmed. Others think that John sent his disciples to Christ for their satisfaction. Christ points them to what they heard and saw. Christ's gracious condescensions and compassions to the poor, show that it was he that should bring to the world the tender mercies of our God. Those things which men see and hear, if compared with the Scriptures, direct in what way salvation is to be found. It is difficult to conquer prejudices, and dangerous not to conquer them; but those who believe in Christ, their faith will be found so much the more to praise, and honour, and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/11.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And blessed is he ... - The word "offence" means a "stumbling-block." See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-29.htm">Matthew 5:29</a>. This verse might be rendered, "Happy is he to whom I shall not prove a stumbling-block." That is, happy is he who shall not take offence at my poverty and lowliness of life, so as to reject me and my doctrine. Happy is the one who can, notwithstanding that poverty and obscurity, see the evidence that I am the Messiah, and follow me. It is not improbable that John wished Jesus publicly to proclaim himself as the Christ, instead of seeking retirement. Jesus replied that he gave sufficient evidence of that by his works; that a man might discover it if he chose; and that he was blessed or happy who should appreciate that evidence and embrace him as the Christ, in spite of his humble manner of life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/11.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

We must imagine these disciples of John to have stayed with Christ some time, and to have seen him work some of these miracles, and to have heard him preach, and seen the great success of his ministry, and then to have left him with this answer. Luke therefore addeth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-21.htm" title="And in that same hour he cured many of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and to many that were blind he gave sight.">Luke 7:21</a></span>, <span class="ital">And in the same hour he cured many</span> <span class="ital">of their infirmities and plagues, and of evil spirits; and unto</span> <span class="ital">many that were blind he gave sight.</span> Then he repeateth the answer which we have here, in which our Saviour refereth unto his works as sufficiently testifying of him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a>,37 10:25,37,38</span>. We read not that these disciples saw any dead person raised while they were with Christ, but it appeareth from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-18.htm" title="And the disciples of John showed him of all these things.">Luke 7:18</a></span>, &c. that the report of such a miracle was the occasion of their coming to Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The question is, how the sight of these things done by our Saviour could be a sufficient argument to confirm to them that he was the Messias, especially considering that his apostles did the same things? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answer:</span> First, it was prophesied by Isaiah, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/35-4.htm" title="Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not: behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompense; he will come and save you....">Isaiah 35:4-6</a></span>, that when God should come to save them, the eyes of the blind should be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped; <span class="ital">then shall the lame</span> <span class="ital">man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing:</span> and <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a></span>, that the Messiah should <span class="ital">preach good tidings to the meek, </span> that is, the poor, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised,">Luke 4:18</a></span>, which Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-21.htm" title="And he began to say to them, This day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears.">Luke 4:21</a></span>, applied to himself. So that the fulfilling of these promises argued that the Messias was come, and no other was to be looked for, whether these things were done by him or by his disciples. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Secondly, the disciples as yet had done no such things, so as his doing of them plainly evidenced his Divine power; the others did them but as his disciples, by his power and authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Thirdly, it is more than probable, that when the disciples did them, they used some such form as Peter used, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-6.htm" title="Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I you: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.">Acts 3:6</a></span>, <span class="ital">In the</span> <span class="ital">name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.</span> We find Peter, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-12.htm" title="And when Peter saw it, he answered to the people, You men of Israel, why marvel you at this? or why look you so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made this man to walk?">Acts 3:12</a></span>, very wary that the people should not mistake in thinking they did it by their own power or holiness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And the poor have the gospel preached unto them.</span> Gr. ptwcoi euaggelizontai, which may be translated, the poor preach the gospel, in an active sense, as the word is used <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-10.htm" title="And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.">Luke 2:10</a></span>; or, the poor are gospelized, taking the word in a passive sense, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/4-2.htm" title="For to us was the gospel preached, as well as to them: but the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.">Hebrews 4:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-25.htm" title="But the word of the Lord endures for ever. And this is the word which by the gospel is preached to you.">1 Peter 1:25</a> 4:6</span>. In the passive sense it may be understood either of a more external reception of the gospel upon preaching, or of a more internal reception of the gospel by faith. In all senses it was true of the times of the Messiah, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The poor preached the gospel; nor was this a mean evidence that the Messiah was come, to see a few poor fishermen at his call leaving their nets and their friends, and following one calling them to preach a new doctrine to the new world. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The poor had the gospel preached to them; nor was this a less evidence of Christ to be the Messiah, considering the prophecy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm" title="The Spirit of the Lord GOD is on me; because the LORD has anointed me to preach good tidings to the meek; he has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound;">Isaiah 61:1</a></span>, and the contempt of the poor amongst the Jews, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm" title="But this people who knows not the law are cursed.">John 7:49</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> But that the poor, who commonly are the more ignorant and rude sort of people, should vouchsafe to hear the gospel, and be turned into the likeness of the gospel upon Christ’s preaching to them, this was yet a higher evidence. Many by <span class="ital">poor</span> understand the poor in spirit. The binding up of broken hearts, and bringing glad tidings to souls sadden on spiritual accounts is a great effect of the Divine power. It followeth, <span class="ital">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be</span> <span class="ital">offended in me.</span> It is not improbable that our Saviour here reflects on the disciples of John, who out of a great honour for their master took many occasions to be offended at Christ. One while because he and his disciples did not first so often as they and the Pharisees, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a></span>; another while because so many followed him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-26.htm" title="And they came to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness, behold, the same baptizes, and all men come to him.">John 3:26</a></span>. But the words spoken have a further reference than to John’s disciples. The Lord Jesus and his doctrine are to many a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence, according to the prophecy, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/8-14.htm" title="And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.">Isaiah 8:14</a></span> <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a sure foundation: he that believes shall not make haste.">Isaiah 28:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-34.htm" title="And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;">Luke 2:34</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness;">1 Corinthians 1:23</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-6.htm" title="Why also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.">1 Peter 2:6</a></span>. The Jews stumbled at the meanness of his person and parentage, and the meanness of his followers. The Gentiles, not at these things only, but his ignominious death. At this day many stumble at the sublimeness and strictness of his doctrine, &c. Christ speaks here with reference to all, and pronounces that man a blessed man, who shall so take offence at nothing, whether respecting his person, his life, or his death, his doctrine, or his followers, as to deter or discourage him from embracing him, and believing in him as the Saviour of lost sinners, that shall by faith receive him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me. The Jews were offended at Christ's parentage and birth, at the poverty of his parents, and at the manner of his birth, by a virgin; and at the place of his birth, which they thought to be Galilee; at his education, because he had not learnt letters, and was brought up to a mechanical employment; at his mean appearance in his public ministry, in his own person, and in his attendants: his company and audience being the poorer sort, the more ignorant, and who had been loose and scandalous persons, publicans and sinners; at the doctrines he preached, particularly, which respected his own deity and eternity, the distinguished grace of God, and living by faith upon his flesh and blood. The disciples of John also were offended in him, because he and his disciples did not fast, and lead such an austere life as they and their master did; because of the meanness and obscurity of Christ's kingdom; the imprisonment of John, and the many reproaches, afflictions, and persecutions, which did, and were likely to attend a profession of Christ: this our Lord knew, and had a peculiar respect to them in these words; but happy are those persons, who, notwithstanding all these difficulties and discouragements, are so far from stumbling at Christ, and falling from him, that they heartily receive him and believe in him, make a profession of him, and hold it fast; greatly love, highly value, and esteem him, and are willing to part with all, and bear all for his sake: these are blessed, notwithstanding all their sufferings for him even now; they have spiritual peace, joy, and comfort in their souls, and shall be happy in the full enjoyment of him to all eternity. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/11.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-6.htm" title="And blessed is he, whoever shall not be offended in me.">Matthew 11:6</a>. <span class="greekheb">μακάριος</span> (<span class="ital">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>), possessed of rare felicity.
