St. Mark adds that “they took Him, even as He was, in the boat,” the words indicating apparently extreme exhaustion from the fatigue of teaching. This, we learn, was followed by immediate sleep as He lay in the stern on the boat’s cushion as a pillow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-23.htm" title="And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him....">Matthew 8:23-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">When he was entered into the ship </span>— Being, as is said above, about to cross the lake; <span class="ital">his disciples followed him </span>— Even as many as were desirous of learning of him, and could get a passage, either in that vessel or any others that were near. <span class="ital">And there arose a great tempest in the sea </span>— <span class="greekheb">Σεισμος μεγας</span>, <span class="ital">a great commotion, </span>or, <span class="ital">agitation of the waters, </span>namely, in consequence of a sudden change of the weather, and storm coming on: an emblem this of the storms of persecution which should afterward assault his church. <span class="ital">Insomuch that the ship was covered with the waves </span>— Which threatened to sink it and all that were in it to the bottom. So the time of man’s extremity is God’s opportunity: <span class="ital">but he was asleep </span>— Being fatigued, it seems, with the labours of the day. <span class="ital">And his disciples awoke him </span>— Being terribly afraid, while they beheld the sky lowering, heard the winds roaring, and observed the sea and the clouds to be driven with the fury of the tempest; <span class="ital">saying, Lord, save us, we perish — </span>Thus manifesting both their faith in his power, and their weakness in not considering who was with them in the ship. <span class="ital">And he saith, Why are ye fearful </span>— Can ye imagine that God would suffer me to be lost in a tempest? or that I would consult my own safety in the neglect of yours? The disciples, having seen their Master perform many miracles, had abundant reason to rely on his power and goodness, even in a greater danger than this. For, though their vessel had sunk, he who gave sight to the blind, cleansed the lepers, drove away palsies and fevers with speaking a word, could easily have saved them all, by making them walk firmly on the water, as he enabled one of them to do afterward. Their timidity, therefore, was altogether culpable, and the reproof he gave them just; <span class="ital">O ye of little faith? </span>— As if he had said, You undertook this voyage at my command, and are you afraid that you should perish in it? <span class="ital">Then he arose, and rebuked the winds </span>— As a master might do a company of turbulent servants. First he composed the spirits of his disciples, then the sea. <span class="ital">And there was a great calm </span>— Namely, instantly, as soon as he had uttered the words, <span class="ital">Peace, be still, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-39.htm" title="And he arose, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.">Mark 4:39</a>. <span class="ital">But the men marvelled </span>— Luke says, <span class="ital">Being afraid, they wondered, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-25.htm" title="And he said to them, Where is your faith? And they being afraid wondered, saying one to another, What manner of man is this! for he commands even the winds and water, and they obey him.">Luke 8:25</a> : and Mark, <span class="ital">They feared exceedingly; saying, What manner of man is this? </span>— Surely he is more than man, who can thus command winds and seas! This reflection of theirs, as well as their fear in the time of danger, may seem to some unaccountable, considering to how many and great miracles of his they had been witnesses. But it must be observed that hitherto his miracles were generally upon diseased persons, and that, till now, he had given no proof of his dominion over the elements of wind and water, which, it seems, were thought less subject to human power than distempers of the body.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:23-27 It is a comfort to those who go down to the sea in ships, and are often in perils there, to reflect that they have a Saviour to trust in and pray to, who knows what it is to be on the water, and to be in storms there. Those who are passing with Christ over the ocean of this world, must expect storms. His human nature, like to ours in every thing but sin, was wearied, and he slept at this time to try the faith of his disciples. They, in their fear, came to their Master. Thus is it in a soul; when lusts and temptations are swelling and raging, and God is, as it were, asleep to it, this brings it to the brink of despair. Then it cries for a word from his mouth, Lord Jesus, keep not silence to me, or I am undone. Many that have true faith, are weak in it. Christ's disciples are apt to be disquieted with fears in a stormy day; to torment themselves that things are bad with them, and with dismal thoughts that they will be worse. Great storms of doubt and fear in the soul, under the power of the spirit of bondage, sometimes end in a wonderful calm, created and spoken by the Spirit of adoption. They were astonished. They never saw a storm so turned at once into a perfect calm. He that can do this, can do any thing, which encourages confidence and comfort in him, in the most stormy day, within or without, Isa 26:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Into a ship - This was on the Sea of Tiberias.

Passage may have been given to him at his request, and of course the disciples went where he went. </body></html>
