The fact that it was a scribe that came is striking, as showing that the impression made by our Lord’s teaching was not confined to the “common people” that “heard him gladly.” As Nicodemus had already come confessing that He was a “Teacher come from God,” so in Galilee there was one whom the Sermon on the Mount, or some like discourse, had led to volunteer at least the show of discipleship.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:18-22 One of the scribes was too hasty in promising; he proffers himself to be a close follower of Christ. He seems to be very resolute. Many resolutions for religion are produced by sudden conviction, and taken up without due consideration; these come to nothing. When this scribe offered to follow Christ, one would think he should have been encouraged; one scribe might do more credit and service than twelve fishermen; but Christ saw his heart, and answered to its thoughts, and therein teaches all how to come to Christ. His resolve seems to have been from a worldly, covetous principle; but Christ had not a place to lay his head on, and if he follows him, he must not expect to fare better than he fared. We have reason to think this scribe went away. Another was too slow. Delay in doing is as bad on the one hand, as hastiness in resolving is on the other. He asked leave to attend his father to his grave, and then he would be at Christ's service. This seemed reasonable, yet it was not right. He had not true zeal for the work. Burying the dead, especially a dead father, is a good work, but it is not thy work at this time. If Christ requires our service, affection even for the nearest and dearest relatives, and for things otherwise our duty, must give way. An unwilling mind never wants an excuse. Jesus said to him, Follow me; and, no doubt, power went with this word to him as to others; he did follow Christ, and cleaved to him. The scribe said, I will follow thee; to this man Christ said, Follow me; comparing them together, it shows that we are brought to Christ by the force of his call to us, Ro 9:16.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And a certain scribe came ... - It is not improbable that this man had seen the miracles of Jesus, and had formed an expectation that by following him he would obtain some considerable worldly advantage. Christ, in reply to his professed purpose to follow him, proclaimed his own poverty, and dashed the hopes of the avaricious scribe. The very foxes and birds, says he, have places of repose and shelter, but the Son of man has no home and no pillow. He is a stranger in his own world - a wanderer and an outcast from the homes of people. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-11.htm">John 1:11</a>.<p>Son of man - This means, evidently, Jesus himself. No title is more frequently given to the Saviour than this, and yet there is much difficulty in explaining it. The word "son" is used in a great variety of significations. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. The name "Son of man" is given to Jesus only three times in the New Testament <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-56.htm">Acts 7:56</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-13.htm">Revelation 1:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm">Revelation 14:14</a>, except by himself. When he speaks of himself, this is the most common appellation by which he is known. The phrase "Son of God," given to Christ, denotes a unique connection with God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-36.htm">John 10:36</a>. The name "Son of man" probably denotes a corresponding unique connection with man. Perhaps the Saviour used it to signify the interest he felt in man; his special love and friendship for him; and his willingness to devote himself to the best interests of the race. It is sometimes, however, used as synonymous with "Messiah," <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm">Matthew 16:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-34.htm">John 1:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-37.htm">Acts 8:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-34.htm">John 12:34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19.

One would have thought, that this man desired in good earnest to be a disciple of Christ, were it not for Christ's answer to him, who knew his heart: from whence it appears, that he, seeing the miracles which Christ wrought, and observing the fame of him among the people, began to think that he would be generally received as the Messiah; and by joining himself to him, promised himself much ease, honour, and wealth. These seem to be the motives, which prevailed upon him to take so sudden and hasty a step; for he did not wait to be called to follow Christ, as the other disciples were, but offers himself to be one; that is, to be one of his intimates, one of his apostles; and besides, he rashly promises to do that, which he knew nothing of, and which in some cases is impossible to be done. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will follow thee whithersoever thou goest.</span><p>(4) The true disciples of Christ must prepare themselves for all kinds of miseries.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/8.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.">Matthew 8:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἷς γραμματεύς</span>] Never, not even in passages like <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm" title="There is a lad here, which has five barley loaves, and two small fishes: but what are they among so many?">John 6:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever.

Tat</span>. p. 398, <span class="ital">ad Anthol</span>. XII. p. 455). It is used (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-24.htm" title="No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.">Matthew 6:24</a>) in the present instance in view of the <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος</span> about to be mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm" title="And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.">Matthew 8:21</a>; for this <span class="greekheb">γραμματείς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go.">Matthew 8:19</a>, and the subsequent <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος</span>, were both of them <span class="ital">disciples</span> of Jesus. It is therefore to be interpreted thus: <span class="ital">one, a scribe</span>. It follows from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-21.htm" title="And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me first to go and bury my father.">Matthew 8:21</a> that this <span class="greekheb">γραμματεύς</span> already belonged to the number of Jesus’ disciples in the more general sense of the word, but he now intimated his willingness to become one of His permanent and intimate followers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The difference in time and place which, as regards the two incidents, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-19.htm" title="And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will follow you wherever you go....">Matthew 8:19-22</a> (in Mark they are omitted), is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-57.htm" title="And it came to pass, that, as they went in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow you wherever you go....">Luke 9:57-60</a>, is not to be removed. The question as to which evangelist the preference is to be assigned in point of the historical faithfulness of his narrative, falls to be decided in favour of <span class="ital">Matthew</span> (Rettig in <span class="ital">d. Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1838, p. 240 ff.), as compared with the loose and indefinite account in Luke (Schleiermacher, Schneckenburger, Gfrörer, Olshausen, Arnoldi, Holtzmann), who, moreover, adds <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-61.htm" title="And another also said, Lord, I will follow you; but let me first go bid them farewell, which are at home at my house.">Luke 9:61</a> f.) still a third, and doubtless no less historical an incident with which he had been made acquainted. Schleiermacher inaptly refers <span class="greekheb">ὅπου ἂν ἀπέρχῃ</span> to the various roads by which Jesus might travel to Jerusalem (Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">Schrift. d.

It is clear, however, from the fact of this narrative occurring so far on in Luke, that he cannot have supposed that the <span class="greekheb">γραμματεύς</span> was <span class="ital">Judas Iscariot</span>, and that the <span class="greekheb">ἕτερος</span> was <span class="ital">Thomas</span> (Lange).
