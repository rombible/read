(1.) The offering of the gift was an act of obedience to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-10.htm" title="And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.">Leviticus 14:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-21.htm" title="And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;">Leviticus 14:21-22</a>), and was therefore the right thing for the man to do. In this way also our Lord showed that He had not come to destroy the Law, but to fulfil. (2.) It was the appointed test of the reality and completeness of the cleansing work. (3.) It was better for the man’s own spiritual life to cherish his gratitude than to waste it in many words.<p>So much lies on the surface. But as the treatment of leprosy in the Mosaic code was clearly symbolical rather than sanitary, and dealt with the disease as the special type of sin in its most malignant form, so in the healing of the leper we may fairly see the symbol of our Lord’s power to purify and save from sin, and in His touching the leper, the close fellowship into which He entered with our unclean nature, that through His touch it might be made clean. The miracle, like most other miracles, was also a parable in act.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-4.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, See you tell no man; but go your way, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Matthew 8:4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus saith, See thou tell no man </span>— Although our Lord was now followed by a great multitude of people, yet it seems not many of them were witnesses of this miracle, Jesus, probably, taking the person aside from the people before he wrought it, otherwise, as Doddridge observes, it does not appear that there could have been room for this charge of secrecy; the meaning of which undoubtedly was, Tell no man that thou wast healed by me; that is, as some suppose, till thou hast offered thy gift to the priest; and he, by receiving it, hath owned thee to be clean from thy leprosy; lest they, hearing that thou wast cleansed by me, should, out of envy to me, refuse to acknowledge thy being cleansed. It must be observed, however, that he commanded many others absolutely to tell none of the miracles he had wrought upon them. And this he seems to have done, chiefly for one or more of these reasons: 1st, to prevent the multitudes from thronging him, in the manner related <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-45.htm" title="But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to him from every quarter.">Mark 1:45</a>; Mark 2 d, to fulfil the prophecy, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>, &c.,) that he would not be vain or ostentatious: this reason St. Matthew assigns, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,">Matthew 12:17</a>, &c.; 3d, to avoid being taken by force and made a king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>; John , , 4 th, that he might not enrage the chief priests, scribes, and Pharisees, who were the most bitter against him, any more than was unavoidable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-20.htm" title="Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ....">Matthew 16:20-21</a>. <span class="ital">But show</span> <span class="ital">thyself to the priest </span>— That is, to any one of the priests to whom the rest have committed the office of examining cases of leprosy. Here it is well observed by Dr. Lightfoot, that, though the priesthood was much degenerated from its primitive institution, and many human inventions were added to God’s law, touching the priest’s examination of the lepers who pretended to be cleansed; yet Christ sends this leper to submit to all these human inventions, as knowing that, though they indeed corrupted, yet they did not destroy the divine institution, and annihilate the office. <span class="ital">For a testimony to them </span>— That is, offer thy gift for a testimony that thou art cleansed from thy leprosy. Dr. Campbell, by the <span class="ital">them </span>here mentioned, understands, <span class="ital">the people, </span>and therefore translates the clause, <span class="ital">Make the oblation prescribed by Moses for notifying </span>[<span class="ital">the cure</span>] <span class="ital">to the people. </span>The <span class="ital">them </span>here, says he, “could not be the <span class="ital">priests, </span>for it was only one priest, (namely, <span class="ital">the priest </span>then intrusted with that business,) to whom he [the man cleansed] was commanded to go. Besides, the oblation could not serve as an evidence to the priest. On the contrary, it was necessary that he should have ocular evidence, by an accurate inspection in private, before the man was admitted into the temple, and allowed to make the oblation; but his obtaining this permission, and the solemn ceremony consequent upon it, was the public testimony of the priest, the only legal judge, to the people, that the man’s uncleanness was removed. This was a matter of the utmost consequence to the man, and of some consequence to them. Till such testimony was given, he lived in a most uncomfortable seclusion from society. No man durst, under pain of being also secluded, admit him into his house, eat with him, or so much as touch him. The antecedent, therefore, to the pronoun <span class="ital">them, </span>though not expressed, is easily supplied by the sense. To me it is equally clear: that the only thing meant to be attested by the oblation was, the cure. The suppositions of some commentators on this subject are quite extravagant. Nothing can be more evident, than that the person now cleansed was not permitted to give any testimony to the priest, or to any other, concerning the manner of his cure, or the person by whom it had been performed. ‘<span class="greekheb">Ορα μηδενι ειπης</span>, <span class="ital">See thou tell nobody. </span>The prohibition is expressed by the Evangelist Mark in still stronger terms. Prohibitions of this kind were often transgressed by those who received them; but that is not a good reason for representing our Lord as giving contradicting orders.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:2-4 In these verses we have an account of Christ's cleansing a leper, who came and worshipped him, as one clothed with Divine power. This cleansing directs us, not only to apply to Christ, who has power over bodily diseases, for the cure of them, but it also teaches us in what manner to apply to him. When we cannot be sure of God's will, we may be sure of his wisdom and mercy. No guilt is so great, but there is that in Christ's blood which atones for it; no corruption so strong, but there is that in his grace which can subdue it. To be made clean we must commend ourselves to his pity; we cannot demand it as a debt, but we must humbly request it as a favour. Those who by faith apply to Christ for mercy and grace, may be sure that he is freely willing to give them the mercy and grace they thus seek. And those afflictions are blessed that bring us to know Christ, and cause us to seek help and salvation from him. Let those who are cleansed from their spiritual leprosy, go to Christ's ministers and open their case, that they may advise, comfort, and pray for them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See thou tell no man - This command is to be understood as extending only to the time until he had made the proper representation to the priest. It was his duty to hasten to him immediately <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>; not to delay by talking about it, but, as the first thing, to obey the laws of God, and make proper acknowledgments to him by an offering. The place where this cure was performed was in Galilee, a distance of 40 or 50 miles from Jerusalem; and it was his duty to make haste to the residence of the priest, and obtain his sanction to the reality of the cure. Perhaps, also, Christ was apprehensive that the report would go "before" the man if he delayed, and the priest, through opposition to Jesus, might pronounce it an imposition.<p>And offer the gift that Moses commanded - That Moses directed to be offered by a leper when he was cured. That gift consisted of "two birds alive and clean, cedar-wood, scarlet, and hyssop," <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-4.htm">Leviticus 14:4</a>.<p>For a testimony unto them - Not to the priest, but to the people. Show thyself to the priest, and get his testimony to the reality of the cure, as a proof to the people that the healing is genuine. It was necessary that he should have that testimony before he could be received to the congregation or allowed to mingle with the people. Having this, he would be, of course, restored to the privileges of social and religious life, and the proof of the miracle, to the people, would be put beyond a doubt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. And Jesus&#8212;"straitly charged him, and forthwith sent him away" (Mr 1:43), and<p>saith unto him, See thou tell no man&#8212;A hard condition this would seem to a grateful heart, whose natural language, in such a case, is "Come, hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what He hath done for my soul" (Ps 66:16). We shall presently see the reason for it.<p>but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded&#8212;(Le 14:1-57).<p>for a testimony unto them&#8212;a palpable witness that the Great Healer had indeed come, and that "God had visited His people." What the sequel was, our Evangelist Matthew does not say; but Mark thus gives it (Mr 1:45): "But he went out, and began to publish it much, and to blaze abroad the matter, insomuch that Jesus could no more openly enter into the city, but was without in desert places: and they came to Him from every quarter." Thus&#8212;by an over-zealous, though most natural and not very culpable, infringement of the injunction to keep the matter quiet&#8212;was our Lord, to some extent, thwarted in His movements. As His whole course was sublimely noiseless (Mt 12:19), so we find Him repeatedly taking steps to prevent matters prematurely coming to a crisis with Him. (But see on [1233]Mr 5:19, 20). "And He withdrew Himself," adds Luke (Lu 5:16), "into the wilderness, and prayed"; retreating from the popular excitement into the secret place of the Most High, and thus coming forth as dew upon the mown grass, and as showers that water the earth (Ps 72:6). And this is the secret both of strength and of sweetness in the servants and followers of Christ in every age.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Some think that our Saviour only commanded him silence until he had showed himself unto the priest, and he, according to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/13-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,...">Leviticus 13:1-59</a></span>, should have pronounced him clean, lest their envy upon hearing of it should have caused them to have obscured the miracle, by delaying to pronounce him clean; but it is observable that this was not the only time when Christ commanded those upon whom he had wrought miracles to say nothing of it: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-30.htm" title="And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straightly charged them, saying, See that no man know it.">Matthew 9:30</a> 12:16 17:9</span>. It is therefore more probable, that this precept was not to be understood with that limitation, but that Christ did it, either that he might not be thought to seek his own glory, or rather, because Christ judged it not yet time by his miracles to be publicly made known: but he sends him to the priest, both to teach him obedience to the law, and that the truth of the miracle might by a public record be confirmed. He also commands him to <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">offer the gift</span> appointed by the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/14-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Leviticus 14:1-57</a></span>, thereby both acknowledging his cure to be from God, and testifying his thankfulness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That Moses commanded; </span> to show that he came not to oppose Moses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">For a testimony unto them; </span> that hereafter it may be a testimony unto them, that I am more than the Son of man, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-36.htm" title="But I have greater witness than that of John: for the works which the Father has given me to finish, the same works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.">John 5:36</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Jesus saith unto him, see thou tell no man, &amp;c. Not that this fact could be concealed, if it was done publicly, before the multitude; nor was it Christ's design that it should be; only it was his counsel to this man, that whilst he was on the road to Jerusalem, and when he was come there, that he would speak of it to no man, before he came to the priest, or priests: lest out of ill will to Christ, they should refuse to pronounce him clean: <p>but go thy way, show thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony unto them. The man was now in one of the cities of Galilee; from hence Christ orders him to make the best of his way, directly to Jerusalem; and present himself to one of the priests, by him to be examined, whether he was free of his leprosy; and then offer what was ordered by the law of Moses in such cases: for as yet the ceremonial law was not abolished: and therefore, as Christ was subject to it himself, so he enjoins others the observance of it. There was a two fold offering, according to the law of Moses, on account of the cleansing of the leper;  <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-1.htm">Leviticus 14:1</a> the one was on the first day of his cleansing, when he first showed himself to the priest, and consisted of two birds, alive and clean, cedar wood, scarlet, and hyssop; the other, and which was properly the offering on the eighth day, was, if the man was able, two he lambs and one ewe lamb, with a meat offering; but if poor, one lamb, with a meat offering, and two turtle doves, or two young pigeons. The Jewish canons, concerning this matter, are as follow (f): <p>"when a leper is healed of his leprosy, after they have cleansed him with cedarwood, and hyssop, and scarlet, and the two birds, and have shaved all his flesh, and bathed him; after all this he enters into Jerusalem, and numbers seven days; and on the seventh day he shaves a second time, as he shaved at first, and bathes--and on the morrow, or eighth day, he bathes a second time, and after that they offer his offerings--he bathes on the eighth day in the court of the women, in the chamber of the lepers, which is there--if it is delayed, and he shaves not on the seventh day, but he shaves on the eighth, or some days after, on the day that he shaves, he bathes, and his sun sets; and on the morrow he brings his offerings, after he hath bathed a second time, as we have declared: how do they do unto him? The leper stands without the court of Israel, over against the eastern gate, in the gate of Nicanor and his face to the west: and there stand all they that want atonement; and there they give the bitter waters to the suspected women: and the priest takes the leper's trespass offering, while it is alive, and waves it with the log of oil, towards the east, according to the way of all wave offerings; and if he waves this by itself, and this by itself, it is right: after that he brings the leper's trespass offering to the door, and he brings it in both his hands into the court, and layeth them upon it; they slay it immediately, and two priests receive its blood: the one receives it in a vessel, and sprinkles it upon the top of the altar; and the other, in his right hand, and pours it into his left hand, and sprinkles with his finger the right hand; and if he repeats it, and receives it in his left hand first, it is unlawful. The priest that receives some of the blood in a vessel, carries it, and sprinkles it upon the altar first; and after that comes the priest, who receives the blood in the palm of his hand, to the leper, the priest being within, and the leper without; and the leper puts in his head, and the priest puts of the blood that is in the palm of his hand, upon the tip of his right ear; after that he puts in his right hand, and he puts of it on the thumb of his hand; and after that he putteth in his right foot, and he puts of it upon the toe of his foot, and if he puts of it upon the left, it is not right; and after that he offers his sin offering, and his burnt offering: and after that he hath put the blood upon his thumb and toe, the priest takes of the log of oil, and pours it into the left hand of his fellow priest; and if he pours it into his own hand, it will do: and he dips the finger of his right hand into the oil, which is in his hand, and sprinkles it seven times towards the most holy place: at every sprinkling there is a dipping of the finger in the oil; and if he sprinkles, and does not intend it, over against the holy place, it is right; and after that, he comes to the leper, and puts of the oil upon the place of the blood of the trespass offering, on the tip of the ear, and on the thumb of his hand, and toe of his foot; and that which is left of the oil, that is in his hand, he puts it on the head of him that is to be cleansed; and if he puts it not, atonement is not made; and the rest of the log is divided among the priests; and what remains of the log is not eaten, but in the Court, by the males of the priests, as the rest of the holy things; and it is forbidden to eat of the log of oil, until he has sprinkled it seven times, and has put of it upon the thumb and toe; and if he eats, he is to be beaten, as he that eats holy things before sprinkling.'' <p>Now these were the things which, as the other evangelists say, this leper was ordered to offer for his cleansing, "for a testimony unto them"; meaning either to the priests; for the Syriac and Persic versions read the former clause, "show thyself to the priests", in  <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a> that they being satisfied of the healing and cleansing of this man, and accordingly pronouncing him clean, and accepting his offerings, this might be either a convincing testimony to them, that Jesus was the Son of God, and true Messiah, and that he did not deny or oppose the law given by Moses; or might be a standing testimony against them, should they continue in unbelief; or else to the Jews, who saw the miracle, and heard the orders Christ gave to the man after he had healed him; or to the lepers that they were cleansed; or this law of Moses was for a testimony or statute to be always observed by them in such cases. <p>(f) Maimon.

Consequently we must reject the view of Maldonatus, Grotius, Bengel, Wetstein, Kuinoel, Paulus, Glöckler, to the effect that He wished to provide against any refusal on the part of the priests to pronounce the man clean. Equally inadmissible is that of Fritzsche, Baumgarten-Crusius, and Keim, that at present, above all, He insisted on the <span class="ital">more important</span> duty,—that, namely, of the man’s subjecting himself to the inspection of the priests, which is not in accordance with the occasional <span class="greekheb">ὅρα</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-31.htm" title="But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.">Matthew 9:31</a>); nor can we accept Olshausen’s view, that the motive for the injunction is to be sought in the man himself. Baur holds that the injunction is not to be regarded as historical, but only as the product of tradition, arising out of the application to Jesus of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a> ff.

It is importing a foreign element, to suppose that the testimony was further meant to show that “I am not abrogating the law” (Chrysostom, Theophylact; see what follows); comp. also Fritzsche, who looks upon the words as containing a remark by Matthew himself: “Haec autem dixit, ut turbae testaretur, se magni facere Mosis instituta.” As decisive against the latter view, we have the fact that both Mark and Luke record the words <span class="greekheb">εἰς μαρτύριον αὐτοῖς</span>, and that, too, in such a way as to make it evident that they formed part of what was spoken by Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-14.htm" title="And he charged him to tell no man: but go, and show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing, according as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.">Luke 5:14</a>).

Zigabenus, Bengel, Keim),—to which the person cleansed was expected to bear witness <span class="ital">before</span> the priests (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἔλεγχον</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς ἀπόδειξιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἰς κατηγορίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐὰν ἀγνωμονῶσιν</span>,—<span class="ital">or</span> the <span class="ital">reality of the cure</span>, “si sc. vellent in posterum negare, me tibi sanitatem restituisse” (Kuinoel, Erasmus, Maldonatus, Grotius), and at the same time the <span class="ital">Messiahship</span> of Jesus (Calovius). According to Olshausen, it is a testimony borne by <span class="ital">the priests themselves</span> that is meant; inasmuch as, by pronouncing the man clean, they become witnesses to the genuineness of the miracle, and at the same time condemn their own unbelief (a confusion of two things that are no less erroneous than foreign to the purpose). If <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῖς</span> referred to the priests, then of course <span class="greekheb">μαρτύριον</span> could only be understood as meaning an evidence or proof that the cleansing had taken place (Grotius). However, the offering was not <span class="ital">meant</span> to furnish such evidence <span class="ital">to the priests</span>, but to the <span class="ital">people</span>, who were now at liberty to resume their intercourse with the person who had been healed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Attempts of various kinds have been made to divest the <span class="ital">miracles of Jesus</span>[430] of their special character, and to reduce them to the order of natural events (Paulus), partly by accounting for them on physiological or psychological grounds, and partly by explaining them on certain exegetical, allegorical, or mythical principles of interpretation. Some, again, have sought to remove them entirely from the sphere of actual fact, and to ascribe their origin to legends elaborated out of Old Testament types and prophecies (Strauss); to the influence of religious feeling in the church (B. Bauer); to narratives of an allegorical character (Volkmar); to the desire to embody certain ideas and tendencies of thought in historical incidents (Baur); as well as to mistakes of every sort in the understanding of similitudes and parables (Weisse). To admit the supernatural origin of Christianity is not inconsistent with the idea of its historical continuity (Baur); but the denial of miracles involves both an avowed and a covert <span class="ital">impugning</span> of the evangelic narrative,—which, as such, is in its substance conditioned by miracles (Holtzmann, p. 510),—and consequently <span class="ital">does away</span> almost entirely with its historical character. As a further result, Christianity itself is endangered, in so far as it is matter of history and not the product of the independent development of the human mind, and inasmuch as its entrance into the world through the incarnation of the Son of God is analogous to the miracle of creation (Philippi, <span class="ital">Glaubensl</span>. I. p. 25 ff., ed. 2). The miracles of Jesus, which should always be viewed in connection with His whole redeeming work (Köstlin, 1860, p. 14 ff.), are outward manifestations of the power of God’s Spirit, dwelling in Him in virtue of His Sonship, and corresponding to His peculiar relation to the world (Hirzel), as well as to His no less peculiar relation to the living God; their <span class="ital">design</span> was to authenticate His Messianic mission, and in this lay their telic <span class="ital">necessity</span>,—a necessity, however, that is always to be regarded as only relative (Schott, <span class="ital">de consilio, quo Jesus mirac. ediderit, Opusc</span>. I. p. 111 ff.). And this according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-11.htm" title="This beginning of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested forth his glory; and his disciples believed on him.">John 2:11</a>. In exercising His supernatural power of healing, the usual though not always (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,">Matthew 8:5</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-47.htm" title="When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went to him, and sought him that he would come down, and heal his son: for he was at the point of death.">John 4:47</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-23.htm" title="And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the people making a noise,">Matthew 9:23</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-51.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, Suffer you thus far. And he touched his ear, and healed him.">Luke 22:51</a>) indispensable condition on which He imparted the blessing was faith in that power on the part of the person to be healed; nothing, however, but positive unbelief prevented this power from taking effect (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-58.htm" title="And he did not many mighty works there because of their unbelief.">Matthew 13:58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-5.htm" title="And he could there do no mighty work, save that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.">Mark 6:5</a> f.; comp. Julius Müller, II. p. 17); but Christ’s heart-searching look (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-25.htm" title="And needed not that any should testify of man: for he knew what was in man.">John 2:25</a>) enabled Him to detect those cases where the attempt would be fruitless. Moreover, the miracles of Jesus are not to be regarded as things that <span class="ital">contradict</span> or violate the laws of nature, but rather as comprehended within the great system of natural law, the harmonious connection of which in all its parts it is not for us to fathom. In this respect the phenomena of magnetism furnish an analogy, though a poor and imperfect one; and the more that is known of the laws of nature, the idea of any annulling or suspension of these laws only appears the more absurd. See Köstlin, 1860, p. 59 ff., 1864, p. 259 ff.; Rothe, p. 34 ff. The miracles, therefore, are “reflections in nature” of God’s revelation of Himself (Beyschlag), “something strictly in accordance with law” (Nitzsch), which, in the sphere of nature, appears as the necessary and natural correlative of the highest miracle in the spiritual world—viz. the accomplishment of the work of redemption by the incarnate Son of God. As this work has its necessary conditions in the higher order of the moral world established and ruled by the holy God in accordance with His love, so the miracles have theirs in the laws of a higher order of nature corresponding to the loving purposes of the Creator, inasmuch as this latter order, in virtue of the connection between nature and spirit, is upheld by that Being whose spiritual power determines all its movements. Comp. Liebner, <span class="ital">Christologie</span>, I. p. 351: “The miracles of Christ are occasional manifestations of the complete introduction, through the God-man, of that relation between nature and spirit which is to be perfected in the end of the world”—means by which the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> reveals Himself in His human impersonation and work, so that they are always of a moral nature, and have always a moral aim in view, unfolding, in their essential connection with His preaching, the miracle of the incarnation on which His whole work was based (Martensen, <span class="ital">Dogm</span>. § 155 [E. T. p. 301]). Observe, moreover, how the power to work miracles was a gift and <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> of the <span class="ital">apostles</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-19.htm" title="Through mighty signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God; so that from Jerusalem, and round about to Illyricum, I have fully preached the gospel of Christ.">Romans 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you in all patience, in signs, and wonders, and mighty deeds.">2 Corinthians 12:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-4.htm" title="God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders, and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will?">Hebrews 2:4</a>), and a <span class="greekheb">χάρισμα</span> of the <span class="ital">apostolic church</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;">1 Corinthians 12:9</a> f.), a fact which warrants us in assuming, indeed in inferring <span class="ital">a minori ad majus</span>, the reality of the miracles of Jesus Himself—in general, we mean, and without prejudice to the criticism of the narratives in detail. At the same time, in the application of such criticism, the hypothesis of legendary embellishments should be treated with great caution by a modest exegesis, and all the more that, in the <span class="ital">fourth</span> Gospel, we have a series of miracles bearing the attestation of one who was an <span class="ital">eye-witness</span>, and which, in their various features, correspond to many of those recorded by the Synoptists.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[430] See Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L.

The Lord did not desire to be thronged with multitudes who came only to see his miracles; he would work in quiet (cf. the quotation from Isaiah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm">Matthew 12:18-21</a>). <span class="cmt_word">But go thy way, show thyself to the priest.</span> The latter clause belongs verbally to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-49.htm">Leviticus 13:49</a>, but the thought is that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-2.htm">Leviticus 14:2</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> Without the official verdict, the man could not be restored to communal privileges (so also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-14.htm">Luke 17:14</a>). <span class="cmt_word">And offer the gift that Moses commanded</span>.

Although a fair sense might be extracted by connecting this clause with. the words, "Moses commanded," it would, especially in the parallel passages, be a very awkward addition to them. Rather it must represent the man's "offering" in its ultimate purpose, and this not necessarily in the man's own mind. So more clearly the "Western" reading in the parallel passage in Luke, <span class="greek">&#x1f35;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>. Whether "them" refers to the priests or to the nation generally is not of grave importance, for the priests themselves, in act and feeling, represented the nation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-29.htm">Matthew 7:29</a>, note). Of more interest is the question  - What is that which is here testified of? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="accented">Prima facie</span> the man's own state. The performance of the rites would be legal evidence that he was clean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> Yet this interpretation is hardly borne out by the usage of the phrase. <span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in the LXX. (never closely with the dative as here) seems to always refer to that which is both permanent and important (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-30.htm">Genesis 21:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-44.htm">Genesis 31:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/31-26.htm">Deuteronomy 31:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-27.htm">Joshua 24:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>). And in the New Testament with the dative it elsewhere refers either to work for the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-18.htm">Matthew 10:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-14.htm">Matthew 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>) or to a solemn judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>). So probably here. The man's offering is to be a permanent testimony to the nation of our Lord's relation to the Law. His miracles confirmed his profession (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm">Matthew 5:17</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Some, however, accepting the above view in the main, translate, "for a testimony against them" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-5.htm">Luke 9:5</a>, and as perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm">James 5:3</a>, but <span class="accented">vide</span> Plumptre there); but it is unlikely that so harsh a thought towards the nation would be expressed by our Lord at this early stage of his ministry. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-11.htm">Mark 6:11</a> there is a definite reason for its use. </body></html>
