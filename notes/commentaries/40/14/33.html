They too were led, in that moment of wonder, to the confession that the Prophet of Nazareth was more than man, and in this, as far as the Gospel record goes, they anticipated the faith even of the foremost of the disciples. It is significant that Peter’s confession that He was “the Son of God,” or “the Holy One of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-69.htm" title="And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God.">John 6:69</a>), follows shortly upon this.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they were come into the ship the wind ceased - Here was a new proof of the power of Jesus. He that has power over winds and waves has all power. John adds <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-21.htm">John 6:21</a> that the ship was immediately at the land whither they went; another proof, amid this collection of wonders, that the Son of God was with them. They came, therefore, and worshipped him, acknowledging him to be the Son of God. That is, they gave him homage, or honored him as the Son of God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

Christ by his company making his mighty power more conspicuous; so as the Manichees had no reason to conclude, from Christ’s walking on the sea, that he had no true human body, for sure Peter had; and they must ascribe little to our Saviour’s Divine nature, that will not allow him to have had a power to suspend the natural motion downward, which we see in all gravity, which is an affection of all human bodies. No sooner was Christ come into the ship, but the wind ceased, in testimony of its homage to him, who bringeth the wind out of his treasuries. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They that were in the ship came and worshipped him, </span> paying a religious homage unto him, as he who had preserved their lives from so great a danger; and they further owned him to be <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the Son of God.</span> This was that great point which God was bringing the world to the acknowledgment of, and we see it was done by degrees. His miracles at first only procured a veneration of him, and a faith that he had his power from God. Then he comes to be acknowledged <span class="ital">the Son of David</span> by the blind man. The miracle of the five loaves brought many to acknowledge him <span class="ital">that Prophet that should come into the world.</span> This is the first time we meet with so plain and open an acknowledgment of his being the Son of God: this was done not only by his disciples, but by the mariners, and the passengers in the ship, but it was far from a steady faith as to that point, which the disciples yet wanted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then they that were in the ship,.... Not only the rest of the disciples, who remained in it, whilst Peter came forth out of it, to walk upon the sea, to go to Christ: but the mariners also, the owners of the vessel, and their servants that managed it, <p>came and worshipped him: not merely in a civil, but in a religious way; being convinced, by what they saw, that he must be truly and properly God, and worthy of adoration; <p>saying, of a truth, thou art the Son of God: not by creation, as angels and men, nor by office, as magistrates, but by nature; being of the same essence, perfections, and power, with God, his Father: and which these actions of his now done, as well as many others, are full attestations of; as his walking upon the sea, causing Peter to do so too, saving him when sinking, and stilling the wind and waves upon his entrance into the vessel; all which being observed by the disciples and mariners, drew out this confession upon full conviction from them, that he was a divine person, and the proper object of worship. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ υἱός</span>] <span class="ital">the Messiah</span>. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>. The impression recorded in the text was founded, so far as the people were concerned, upon the miraculous walking on the sea itself, and partly upon the connection which existed, and which they recognised as existing, between the calming of the storm and the going on board of Jesus and Peter. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ</span> are not the disciples (Hilgenfeld, Schegg, Keim, Scholten), but those who, besides them, were crossing in the boat, the crew and others. Comp. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄνθρωποι</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm" title="But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!">Matthew 8:27</a>.

Grotius limits the meaning too much when he says: “ipsi <span class="ital">nautae</span>.” Mark omits this concluding part of the incident, and merely records the great astonishment on the part of the disciples. As it stands in Matthew, it is to be regarded as connecting a traditional amplification with the episode of Peter, which that evangelist has embodied in his narrative, but yet as containing nothing improbable, in so far as it makes it appear that the outburst of astonishment was so great that it expressed itself in the acknowledgment of our Lord’s Messiahship, especially as it is to be borne in mind that the miraculous feeding of the multitudes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world....">John 6:14-15</a>) had taken place but so short a time before. Moreover, this is, according to Matthew, the first time that Jesus was designated the Son of God by <span class="ital">men</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm" title="And see a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.">Matthew 3:17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-3.htm" title="And when the tempter came to him, he said, If you be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread.">Matthew 4:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm" title="And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with you, Jesus, you Son of God? are you come here to torment us before the time?">Matthew 8:29</a>). According to John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-50.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? you shall see greater things than these.">John 1:50</a>), He had already been so styled by Nathanael; in the present instance He received the designation from those who, as yet, were not of the number of His disciples.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐν τῷ πλοίῳ</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἄνθρωποι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm" title="But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!">Matthew 8:27</a>; presumably the disciples alone referred to.—<span class="greekheb">ἀληθῶς θ</span>. <span class="greekheb">υ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἶ</span>, a great advance on <span class="greekheb">ποταπός</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm" title="But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!">Matthew 8:27</a>).

If there were others than the disciples in the boat, as is probable, these also would be included; but the disciples would naturally take the lead (cf. the notes on Matthew 8:23, 27). <span class="cmt_word">Came and.</span> The Revised Version omits these two words, with the manuscripts. They are due to the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-18.htm">Matthew 9:18</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Worshipped him</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-9.htm">Matthew 4:9</a>, note). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-27.htm">Matthew 8:27</a> we read of wonder; here, of homage. <span class="cmt_word">Saying, Of a truth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1ff6;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-18.htm">Matthew 5:18</a>, <span class="accented">s.v.</span> "verily." The word seems to imply that the suggestion did not enter their minds now for the first time. Two had, perhaps, heard the words spoken at the baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>), and most of them, if not all, the utterance by the demons in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a>. Yet these utterances in reality far surpassed what they even nosy imagined (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Thou art the Son of</span> <span class="cmt_word">God</span> (<span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;</span>). Although the phrase is not of the definite form found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63</a> and Matthew 16:16, where it is used with express reference to the Messiahship of Jesus (cf. for the intermediate form, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-40.htm">Matthew 27:40</a> with 43), yet it is impossible to take it here as merely referring to a moral relation between Jesus and God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-54.htm">Matthew 27:54</a> this might be sufficient (Luke has "righteous"); but here there is no question of coming up to a standard of moral uprightness, but rather of manifestation of power, and this is connected with Messiah. His authority over the elements leads to the homage of those who witness its exercise,  and forces from them the expression that he is the promised Representative of God on earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-7.htm">Psalm 2:7</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>, note). Observe, however, that not even so is it a profession of faith in his absolute Divinity. (Kubel's note on this subject in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-29.htm">Matthew 8:29</a> is very good.) </body></html>
