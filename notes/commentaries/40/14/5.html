There was yet a struggle of conscience against passion in the weak and wicked tetrarch, as there was in Ahab in his relations with Elijah. In Herodias, as in Jezebel, there was no halting between two opinions, and she, in the bitterness of her hate, thirsted for the blood of the prophet who had dared to rebuke her guilt.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-12 The terror and reproach of conscience, which Herod, like other daring offenders, could not shake off, are proofs and warnings of a future judgment, and of future misery to them. But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For Herod had laid hold on John ... - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-17.htm">Mark 6:17-20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/3-19.htm">Luke 3:19-20</a>. This Herodias was a granddaughter of Herod the Great. She was first married to Herod Philip, by whom she had a daughter, Salome, probably the one that danced and pleased Herod. Josephus says that this marriage of Herod Antipas with Herodias took place while he was on a journey to Rome. He stopped at his brother's; fell in love with his wife; agreed to put away his own wife, the daughter of Aretas, King of Petraea; and Herodias agreed to leave her own husband and live with him. They were living, therefore, in adultery; and John, in faithfulness, though at the risk of his life, had reproved them for their crimes. Herod was guilty of two crimes in this act:<p>1. Of "adultery," since she was the wife of another man.<p>2. Of "incest," since she was a near relation, and such marriages were expressly forbidden, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-16.htm">Leviticus 18:16</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

As soon as he apprehended him, and put him into prison; being provoked by his reproving him, and being stirred up by Herodias, who was greatly incensed and enraged, and would have killed him herself, but could not, being hindered by Herod: who, though he had a good will and strong inclination to take away his life, yet what with fearing the terror of his own conscience, and the reverence and respect he had for John, as a good man; and especially for the reason here given, he did not do it, for <p>he feared the multitude: not God, but the multitude; and these, not only the large number of people that attended on John's ministry, and were baptized by him, and became his disciples, but the generality of the people, the whole body of the Jewish nation. So God is pleased oftentimes to restrain the wickedness of princes, by the fear of their subjects: <p>because they counted him as a prophet; a holy good man, and who was sent of God; they respected him as such, believing him to be a true and real prophet, and treated him with honour and reverence, suitable to his character; wherefore Herod was afraid, should he take away his life, that the people would mutiny, rise up against him, and revolt from him. In what esteem John was with the people of the Jews in general, may be learned from the character Josephus gives of him, as a good man; who stirred up the Jews to the practice of virtue, especially piety and justice; which made the common people fond of him and his doctrine; and who were of opinion, that the defeat of Herod's army, which followed the death of John, was a just judgment of God upon him for it (m). <p>(m) Antiqu. 1. 18. c. 6. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/14.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm" title="And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.">Matthew 14:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">θέλων</span>: <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm" title="Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.">Matthew 1:19</a>. Mark gives a fuller statement as to Herod’s feelings towards John. No injustice is done Herod here by ascribing to him a wish to get rid of John. There are always mixed feelings in such cases. Compare the relations of Alcibiades to Socrates as described by Plato (<span class="greekheb">Συμπόσιον</span>). <span class="greekheb">ἐφοβήθη τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὀ</span>.: that for one thing; also feared God and his conscience a <span class="ital">little</span>, not enough.

St Mark’s narrative gives a picture of the inner court intrigues, and bears evidence of keen questioning of some eye-witness as to facts. Possibly some of Herod’s own household were secret adherents of John.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">feared the multitude</span>, &c.] The same motive that held the tyrant’s hand, checked the arguments of the Pharisees, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-26.htm" title="But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold John as a prophet.">Matthew 21:26</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/14.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm" title="And when he would have put him to death, he feared the multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.">Matthew 14:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐφοβήθη</span>, <span class="ital">feared</span>) They often fear who crush the witnesses of truth, whilst the witnesses themselves fear not their oppressors.[664]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[664] An evil purpose, which has been scarcely begun, is afterwards, whenever a very slight opportunity may present itself, brought forth into action.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/14.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And when he would have put him</span> <span class="cmt_word">to death, he feared the multitude</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-6.htm">Luke 20:6</a>). Mark has, "And Herodias set herself against him, <span class="accented">and would have put him to death</span>; and she could not; for Herod <span class="accented">feared</span> John." The more detailed account in Mark is doubtless the more exact. Perhaps the facts of the case were that, in the first heat of his resentment, Herod wished to kill John, but feared the anger of the people, and that afterwards, when he him in his power and Herodias still urged his death, Herod had himself learned to respect him.
