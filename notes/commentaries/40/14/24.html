It is worthy of notice here, 1st, That the disciples were now where Christ had sent them, and yet they met with this storm. Had they been flying from their Master and their work, as Jonah was when he was arrested by the storm, it would have been less surprising that they should be thus assaulted; but they had a special command from their Master to go to sea at this time, and were going about his work, and yet a storm overtakes them! We see, therefore, that Christ’s disciples may meet with troubles and afflictions in the way of their duty; and be sent to sea when their Master foresees a storm. They ought not, however, to take it unkindly; for what he does they know not now, but they shall know hereafter that Christ designs hereby to manifest himself with the more wonderful grace to them and for them. 2d, This storm did not attack them immediately on their setting out: they had got into the midst of the sea when it arose. We may have fair weather in the beginning of our course, and yet meet with storms before we arrive at the port we are bound for. Therefore let not him that girds on the harness boast as he that puts it off: after a long calm, expect some storm or other. 3d, It was a great discouragement to the disciples, that now they had not Christ with them, as they had formerly when they were in a storm: for though he was then asleep, he was soon waked, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-24.htm" title="And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, so that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.">Matthew 8:24</a>, but now he was at a distance from them. Thus Christ inures his disciples first to lesser difficulties, and then to greater, and so trains them by degrees to live and walk <span class="ital">by faith, and not by sight. </span>4th, Though the wind was contrary, and they were tossed with waves; yet, being ordered by their Master to <span class="ital">go to the other side, </span>they did not tack about and come back again, but made the best of their way forward. Hereby we learn, that though troubles and difficulties may assault and annoy us in our duty, they must net drive us from it; but through the midst of them we must press forward.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the ship was now in the midst of the sea - John says they had sailed about 25 or 30 furlongs.

That is, the ship in which the disciples were put into, to go on the other side, had by this time got into the midst of the sea: the Syriac and Persic versions say, it was "many furlongs from land"; and the Arabic expressly says, "about twenty five furlongs": which account seems to be taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm">John 6:19</a> but this was not all, it was not only at such a distance from land, but was <p>tossed with waves: up and down, and in danger of being overset, and the passengers lost: <p>for the wind was against them; which beat the waves with such violence against them, that they were in the utmost danger of their lives, and not able to get forward; and what was worst of all, and most discouraging to the disciples, Christ was not with them. The ship in which the disciples were, was an emblem of the church of Christ, and of its state and condition in this world: this world is like a sea, for its largeness, and the abundance of nations and people in it, compared to many waters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-15.htm">Revelation 17:15</a> and for the tumultuousness of its inhabitants; the wicked being like a troubled sea, which cannot rest, continually casting up the mire and dirt of sin, to the dishonour of God, and the grief of his people; and for its fickleness and inconstancy, changes and war being continually in it: now the church of Christ is like a ship in this troublesome sea; where the true disciples and followers of Christ are selected together; and are preserved from the pollutions of the world, and from the danger to which the men of it are exposed, being in their sins, and liable to the wrath and curse of God, and eternal damnation; which, they that are in Christ, and members of his body, are secure from; the port or haven to which they are bound, is heaven and eternal happiness; their's and Christ's Father's house, where are many mansions provided for them; and where they long to be, and hope, and believe, ere long they shall arrive unto; and hope is as an anchor of their soul, sure and steadfast: but in the mean while, whilst they are sailing through the sea of this world, they are often, as the church of old, tossed with tempests, and not comforted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a> with the tempests of Satan's temptations, the storms of the world's persecutions, and with the winds of error and false doctrine; and then is it most uncomfortable to them, when Christ is not with them, which was the case of the disciples here. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.</span><p>(3) We must sail even through mighty tempests, and Christ will never forsake us, so that we can go wherever he has commanded us to go.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-24.htm" title="But the ship was now in the middle of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.">Matthew 14:24</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Μέσον</span>] Adjective; with more precision in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm" title="So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.">John 6:19</a>.

And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.">Matthew 14:29</a>, by the ridiculous nature of the fear of what was supposed to be an apparition if Jesus had only walked <span class="ital">along the shore</span>, by the <span class="greekheb">ἀπῆλθε πρὸς αὐτούς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-25.htm" title="And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.">Matthew 14:25</a>, as well as by the fact that, if Jesus had been on the shore (Strauss, II. p. 170), then the disciples, who were in the middle of the lake, forty stadia in breadth, with the roar of the waves sounding in their ears, could not possibly hear what He was saying when He addressed them. It remains, then, that we have here a case of <span class="ital">miraculous walking on the sea</span>, which least of all admits of being construed into an act of <span class="ital">swimming</span> (Bolten); but neither are we to try to explain it by supposing (Olshausen) that, by the exercise of His own will, our Lord’s bodily nature became exempted, for the time being, from the conditions of its earthly existence; nor should we attempt to render it intelligible by the help of foreign analogies (the cork-footed men in Lucian. <span class="ital">14 :hist.</span> ii. 4; the seeress of Prevost; the water-treaders, and such like), but, as being akin to the miracle of the stilling of the tempest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm" title="And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.">Matthew 4:25</a> ff.), it should rather be examined in the light of that power over the elements which dwells in Christ as the incarnate Son of God. At the same time, it must be confessed that it is utterly impossible to determine by <span class="ital">what means</span> this miraculous walking was accomplished. From a teleological point of view, it will be deemed sufficient that it serves to form a practical demonstration of the Messiahship of Jesus, a consideration (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-33.htm" title="Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth you are the Son of God.">Matthew 14:33</a>) which was no less present to the minds of the evangelists in constructing their narratives. The credibility of those evangelists—among whom is John, whose personal experience lends additional weight to his testimony—must prove fatal, not only to any attempt to resolve our narrative into a <span class="ital">mythical sea story</span> (Strauss, who invokes the help of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-14.htm" title="And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.">2 Kings 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-6.htm" title="And the man of God said, Where fell it? And he showed him the place. And he cut down a stick, and cast it in thither; and the iron did swim.">2 Kings 6:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm" title="Which alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.">Job 9:8</a>, and the legends of other nations), or even into a <span class="ital">docetic fiction</span> (Hilgenfeld), but also to the half and half view, that some <span class="ital">event</span> or other, which occurred on the night in question, developed (Hase) into one of those genuine <span class="ital">legendary</span> stories which serve to <span class="ital">embody some particular idea</span> (in this instance, the walking on the water, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm" title="Which alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.">Job 9:8</a>). In the same way Baumgarten-Crusius, <span class="ital">on John</span>, I. p. 234, regards a case of walking <span class="ital">on the sea</span>, recorded by John, as the <span class="ital">original</span> tradition; while Weisse, p. 521 (comp. Schneckenburger, <span class="ital">erst. kan. Ev.</span> p. 68), avails himself of the <span class="ital">allegorical</span> view; Bruno Bauer, again, here as elsewhere, pushes negative principles to their extreme limit; and Volkmar sees reflected in the narrative Paul’s mission to the Gentiles. Weizsäcker and Keim likewise assume, though with more caution and judgment, the allegorical standpoint, the former being disposed to regard the interposing of Jesus with His help, and the power of faith in conquering danger, as constituting the essence of the whole; Keim again being inclined to see in the story an allusion to the distress and desolation of the church waiting for her Lord, and not knowing but that He may not come to her help till the very last watch in the night (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-43.htm" title="But know this, that if the manager of the house had known in what watch the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken up.">Matthew 24:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-35.htm" title="Watch you therefore: for you know not when the master of the house comes, at even, or at midnight, or at the cock-crowing, or in the morning:">Mark 13:35</a>),—an idea which, as he thinks, is indebted in no small degree to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-8.htm" title="Which alone spreads out the heavens, and treads on the waves of the sea.">Job 9:8</a>, where God is represented as treading on the waves of the sea. But even this mode of interpretation, though in accordance, it may be, with the <span class="ital">letter</span>, cannot but do violence to the whole <span class="ital">narrative</span> as a statement of fact.

But the reading of [88], probably to be preferred, implies that the boat was many stadii (25 or 30, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-19.htm" title="So when they had rowed about five and twenty or thirty furlongs, they see Jesus walking on the sea, and drawing near to the ship: and they were afraid.">John 6:19</a> = 3 to 4 miles) from the eastern shore.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τῶν κυμάτων</span>: not in Mk., and goes without saying; when there are winds there will be waves.—<span class="greekheb">ἐναντίος ὁ ἄνεμος</span>: What wind?
