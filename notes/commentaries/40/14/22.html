It led those who witnessed it to the conclusion that “this was the Prophet that should come into the world.” They sought to seize Him and make Him a king against His will (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/6-14.htm" title="Then those men, when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world.">John 6:14-15</a>), and He, shrinking from that form of sovereignty, withdrew from His disciples, dismissed the multitude, and on the mountain height passed the night in prayer. The disciples at His bidding were crossing to the other side to Bethsaida (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm" title="And straightway he constrained his disciples to get into the ship, and to go to the other side before to Bethsaida, while he sent away the people.">Mark 6:45</a>)—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> to the town of that name on the western shore of the lake near Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-17.htm" title="And entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.

It was, we may reverently say, as if in this unwonted stir of popular excitement—not against Him, but in His favour—this nearness to a path of earthly greatness instead of that which led onward to the cross, He saw something like a renewal of the temptation in the wilderness, needing special communion with His Father, that He might once again resist and overcome it. And once again, therefore, He desired to pass through the conflict alone, as afterwards in Gethsemane, with no human eye to witness the temptation or the victory.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/14.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm" title="And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.">Matthew 14:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, </span>&c. — According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm" title="When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force, to make him a king, he departed again into a mountain himself alone.">John 6:15</a>, the people were so affected with the above-mentioned miracle, that they were <span class="ital">about to take him by force, and make him a king, </span>very naturally supposing, doubtless, that he, who with five loaves and two fishes could feed so many thousands, was able to support armies any length of time he pleased. And it is probable that his disciples were disposed to encourage and aid them in these intentions. Jesus, therefore, knowing both the purposes of the multitude and the inclinations of the disciples, ordered the latter to get into a vessel, and make for Bethsaida, while he should dismiss the former. This they were unwilling to do: it is therefore here said that Christ <span class="ital">constrained them.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:22-33 Those are not Christ's followers who cannot enjoy being alone with God and their own hearts. It is good, upon special occasions, and when we find our hearts enlarged, to continue long in secret prayer, and in pouring out our hearts before the Lord. It is no new thing for Christ's disciples to meet with storms in the way of duty, but he thereby shows himself with the more grace to them and for them. He can take what way he pleases to save his people. But even appearances of deliverance sometimes occasion trouble and perplexity to God's people, from mistakes about Christ. Nothing ought to affright those that have Christ near them, and know he is theirs; not death itself. Peter walked upon the water, not for diversion or to boast of it, but to go to Jesus; and in that he was thus wonderfully borne up. Special supports are promised, and are to be expected, but only in spiritual pursuits; nor can we ever come to Jesus, unless we are upheld by his power. Christ bade Peter come, not only that he might walk upon the water, and so know his Lord's power, but that he might know his own weakness. And the Lord often lets his servants have their choice, to humble and prove them, and to show the greatness of his power and grace. When we look off from Christ, and look at the greatness of opposing difficulties, we shall begin to fall; but when we call to him, he will stretch out his arm, and save us. Christ is the great Saviour; those who would be saved, must come to him, and cry to him, for salvation; we are never brought to this, till we find ourselves sinking: the sense of need drives us to him. He rebuked Peter. Could we but believe more, we should suffer less. The weakness of faith, and the prevailing of our doubts, displease our Lord Jesus, for there is no good reason why Christ's disciples should be of a doubtful mind. Even in a stormy day he is to them a very present help. None but the world's Creator could multiply the loaves, none but its Governor could tread upon the waters of the sea: the disciples yield to the evidence, and confess their faith. They were suitably affected, and worshipped Christ. He that comes to God, must believe; and he that believes in God, will come, Heb 11:6.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And straightway Jesus constrained ... - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45-56</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15-21</a>. The word "straightway" means immediately; that is, as soon as the fragments were gathered up. To "constrain" usually means to compel. It here means to command. There was no need of compulsion. They were at this time on the east side of the Lake of Gennesareth. He directed them to get into a ship and cross over to the other side; that is, to Capernaum. Mark adds that he sent them to Bethsaida <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-45.htm">Mark 6:45</a>. Bethsaida was situated at the place where the Jordan empties into the lake on the east side of the river. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>. It is probable that he directed them to go in a ship or boat to Bethsaida, and remain there till he should dismiss the people, and that he would meet them there, and with them cross the lake. The effect of the miracle on the multitude was so great <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a> that they believed him to be that prophet which should come into the world; that is, the Messiah, the king that they had expected, and they were about to take him by force and make him a king, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>. To avoid this, Jesus got away from them as privately as possible. He went into a solitary mountain alone. In view of the temptation - when human honors were offered to him and almost forced upon him - he retired for private prayer; an example for all who are tempted with human honors and applause. Nothing is better to keep the mind humble and unambitious than to seek some lonely place; to shut out the world with all its honors; to realize that the great God, before whom all creatures and all honors sink to nothing, is round about us; and to ask him to keep us from pride and vainglory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 14:22-26.

As soon as ever he had wrought the above miracle, and perceived that the people were so convinced by it, of his being the Messiah, that they were determined, whether he would or not, to set him up for a temporal king, to deliver them from the Roman yoke; which they doubted not he was able to do, who could feed so large a number, with such a small quantity of provision; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a> and knowing also, that his disciples had imbibed the same notion of a temporal kingdom, were very fond of it, and big with expectation thereof; and would have readily encouraged the populace, and joined with them in such an action: wherefore, in all haste, he hurried them away, obliged them to depart, lest any step should be taken, which might be of dangerous consequence to them, and the people: it looks as if the disciples were bent upon the same thing, and that it was with much difficulty and reluctance they were brought off of it. Christ was forced to use his power and authority; and order them directly <p>to get into a ship; very likely, the same they came over in; <p>and to go before him unto the other side of the lake of Tiberias or sea of Galilee, over against Bethsaida, to Capernaum, or the land of Gennesaret; <p>while he sent the multitudes away: who would not so easily have been prevailed upon to have departed, if Christ had not first shipped off his disciples; for had he withdrawn himself, and left his disciples with them, they would have been in hopes of his return, and would have continued in a body with them, in expectation of it; and therefore, the better to disperse them, and prevent their designs, he sends away his disciples before him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/14.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/14.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-22.htm" title="And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.">Matthew 14:22</a> f.

He walks on the water and stays the storm. St. Peter's attempt to walk on the water is successful so long as he exercises faith on Christ. Jesus receives homage as Messiah.

It is strange that the incident of St. Peter is recorded in Matthew only, and not in Mark, for it serves to emphasize what is a leading thought of the preceding narrative, even in Mark, viz. the power that believers receive by virtue of faith on Christ (vers. 16, 19). With Christ in the boat, difficulties cease (ver. 32); they that believe on him can triumph as he did (vers. 28-31; cf. the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-19.htm">John 14:19</a>, end). For St. John's purpose the mention of St. Peter was not necessary; since, by way of introduction to the following discourse, be desired rather to familiarize his readers with the idea of Christ's body being triumphant over earthly limitations (cf. ver. 19, note). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples.</span> It was not their wish to leave him, especially when the multitudes seemed likely to elect him king (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-15.htm">John 6:15</a>). But from the temptation to side with the multitudes our Lord desired now to shield them. Separation and physical work (ver. 24) would calm their excitement, and the object lesson that their Master already ruled over wind and sea would lead them to more perfect trust in his methods. Another reason for his sending them forward may have been that they should use the failing light; and yet another, that he himself desired time for prayer. <span class="cmt_word">To get into a ship;</span> <span class="accented">a boat</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bc;&#x3b2;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-23.htm">Matthew 8:23</a> (<span class="accented">the boat</span>, Revised Version, reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">And to go before him</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-9.htm">Matthew 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm">Matthew 21:9</a>).
