Under his father’s will he succeeded to the government of Galilee and Peræa, with the title of Tetrarch, and as ruler of a fourth part of the Roman province of Syria. His first wife was a daughter of Aretas, an Arabian king or chief, named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-32.htm" title="In Damascus the governor under Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desirous to apprehend me:">2Corinthians 11:32</a> as king of the Damascenes. Herodias, the wife of his half-brother Philip (not the Tetrarch of Trachonitis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm" title="Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene,">Luke 3:1</a>, but son of Herod the Great by Mariamne, and though wealthy, holding no official position as a ruler), was daughter of Aristobulus, the son whom Herod put to death, and was therefore niece to both her husbands. Prompted partly by passion, partly by ambition, she left Philip, and became the wife of Antipas (Jos. <span class= "ital">Ant. xviii.</span> 5, §4). The marriage, at once adulterous and by the Mosaic law doubly incestuous, shocked the conscience of all the stricter Jews. It involved Antipas in a war with the father of the wife whom he had divorced and dismissed, and it was probably in connection with this war that we read of soldiers on actual duty as coming under the teaching of the Baptist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm" title="And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said to them, Do violence to no man, neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages.">Luke 3:14</a>. The prophetic spirit of the Baptist, the very spirit of Elijah in his dealings with Ahab and Jezebel, made him the spokesman of the general feeling, and so brought him within the range of the vindictive bitterness of the guilty queen.<p><span class= "bld">Heard of the fame of Jesus.</span>—The words do not necessarily imply that no tidings had reached him till now. Our Lord’s ministry, however, had been at this time at the furthest not longer than a year, and possibly less, and Antipas, residing at Tiberias and surrounded by courtiers, might well be slow to hear of the works and teaching of the Prophet of Nazareth. Possibly, the nobleman of Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-46.htm" title="So Jesus came again into Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine.

But there may be the terror of convictions, where there is not the truth of conversion. When men pretend to favour the gospel, yet live in evil, we must not favour their self-delusion, but must deliver our consciences as John did. The world may call this rudeness and blind zeal. False professors, or timid Christians, may censure it as want of civility; but the most powerful enemies can go no further than the Lord sees good to permit. Herod feared that the putting of John to death might raise a rebellion among the people, which it did not; but he never feared it might stir up his own conscience against him, which it did. Men fear being hanged for what they do not fear being damned for. And times of carnal mirth and jollity are convenient times for carrying on bad designs against God's people. Herod would profusely reward a worthless dance, while imprisonment and death were the recompence of the man of God who sought the salvation of his soul. But there was real malice to John beneath his consent, or else Herod would have found ways to get clear of his promise. When the under shepherds are smitten, the sheep need not be scattered while they have the Great Shepherd to go to. And it is better to be drawn to Christ by want and loss, than not to come to him at all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Herod the tetrarch - See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14-16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-7.htm">Luke 9:7-9</a>. This was a son of Herod the Great. Herod the Great died probably in the first year after the birth of Christ, and left his kingdom to his three sons, of whom this "Herod Antipas" was one. He ruled over Galilee and Perea. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a>. The title "tetrarch" literally denotes one who rules over a "fourth" part of any country. It came, however, to signify the governor or ruler of any province subject to the Roman emperor - Robinson, Lexicon.<p>Heard of the fame of Jesus - Jesus had been a considerable time engaged in the work of the ministry, and it may seem remarkable that he had not before heard of him. Herod might, however, have been absent on some expedition to a remote part of the country. It is to be remembered, also, that he was a man of much dissoluteness of morals, and that he paid little attention to the affairs of the people. He might have heard of Jesus before, but it had not arrested his attention. He did not think it a matter worthy of much regard. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/14.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 14<p>Mt 14:1-12.

Not Herod the Great, in whose reign Christ was born, and who slew the infants of Bethlehem, but his son; this was, as the Jewish chronologer (c) rightly observes, <p>"Herod Antipater, whom they call  "the tetrarch"; the son of Herod the First, and brother of Archelaus, and the third king of the family of Herod.'' <p>And though he is here called a "tetrarch", he is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-14.htm">Mark 6:14</a> called a king: the reason of his being styled a "tetrarch" was this; his father Herod divided his large kingdom into four parts, and bequeathed them to his sons, which was confirmed by the Roman senate: Archelaus reigned in Judea in his stead; upon whose decease, that part was put under the care of a Roman governor; who, when John the Baptist began to preach, was Pontius Pilate; this same Herod here spoken of, being "tetrarch" of Galilee, which was the part assigned him; and his brother Philip "tetrarch" of Ituraea, and of the region of Trachonitis; and Lysanias, "tetrarch" of Abilene, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-1.htm">Luke 3:1</a> the word "tetrarch": signifying one that has the "fourth" part of government: and in Munster's Hebrew Gospel, he is called "one of the four princes"; and in the Arabic version, "a prince of the fourth part"; and in the Persic, a "governor of the fourth part of the kingdom". The "time" referred to, was after the death of John the Baptist; and when Christ had been for a good while, and in many places, preaching and working miracles; the particular instant which respect is had unto, is the sending forth of the twelve disciples to preach and work miracles; and which might serve the more to spread the fame of Christ, and which reached the court of Herod; who, it is said here, <p>heard of the fame of Jesus: what a wonderful preacher he was, and what mighty things were done by him. <p>(c) David Ganz.

This section might with advantage have been given as a short chapter by itself, and a new start made with the feeding of the thousands which forms the first of a series of narratives together giving the story of the <span class="ital">later</span> Galilean ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-3.htm" title="For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.">Matthew 14:3</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-16.htm" title="So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be called, but few chosen.">Matthew 20:16</a>). In this section (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/14-1.htm" title="At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,...">Matthew 14:1-12</a>) Matthew still has his eye on Mark, the story of the fate of the Baptist being there the next after the section in reference to mother and brethren, excepting the mission of the Twelve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/6-7.htm" title="And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them forth by two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits;...">Mark 6:7-13</a>) already related in Mt.

Indeed from this point onwards Matthew follows Mark’s order.

See Mark loc. cit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Herod</span>] Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Galilee and Peræa. He was a son of Herod the Great, and Malthakè, a Samaritan, who was also the mother of Archelaus and Olympias. He was thus of Gentile origin, and his early associations were Gentile, for he was brought up at Rome with his brother Archelaus. He married first a daughter of Aretas, king of Arabia, and afterwards, while his first wife was still living, he married Herodias, wife of his half-brother Philip,—who was living in a private station, and must not be confused with Philip the tetrarch of Iturea. Cruel, scheming, irresolute, and wicked, he was a type of the worst of tyrants. He intrigued to have the title of tetrarch changed for the higher title of king; very much as Charles the Bold, of Burgundy, endeavoured to change his dukedom into a kingdom. In pursuance of this scheme Antipas went to Rome “to receive for himself a kingdom and return” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-12.htm" title="He said therefore, A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.">Luke 19:12</a>). He was however foiled in this attempt by the arts of his nephew Agrippa, and was eventually banished to Lyons, being accused of confederacy with Sejanus, and of an intention to revolt. Herodias was his worst enemy: she advised the two most fatal errors of his reign: the execution of John Baptist, which brought him into enmity with the Jews, and the attempt to gain the royal title, the result of which was his fall and banishment. But there is a touch of nobility in the determination she took to share her husband’s exile as she had shared his days of prosperity. For Herod’s designs against our Lord, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/13-31.htm" title="The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him, Get you out, and depart hence: for Herod will kill you.">Luke 13:31</a>; and for the part which he took in the Passion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/23-6.htm" title="When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man were a Galilaean....">Luke 23:6-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the tetrarch</span>] Literally, the ruler of a fourth part or district into which a province was divided; afterwards the name was extended to denote generally a petty king, the ruler of a provincial district.
