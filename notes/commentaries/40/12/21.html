Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And in his name ... - The Hebrew in Isaiah is, "And the isles shall wait for his law." The idea is, however, the same.<p>The "isles" denote the Gentiles, or a part of the Gentiles - those out of Judea. The meaning is, that the gospel should be preached to the Gentiles, and that they should receive it. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-1.htm">Isaiah 41:1</a> for an explanation of the word "islands," as it is used in the Bible. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Though Christ be meek and gentle with men a long time, while there is any hope of their reformation, yet he will not be so meek and patient always. Neither was he so with the Jews. But the falling of them proved the rising of the Gentiles. Christ is beholden to no people for bearing the name of his church; if the Jews fail in their duty, they shall be cast off, and <span class="ital">in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</span> God is able of stones to raise up children unto Abraham. Isaiah saith, <span class="ital">the isles shall wait for his law; </span> his law, both of faith and holiness, shall be acceptable to the Gentiles. The term <span class="ital">law</span> here seemeth to expound that phrase, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a></span>, <span class="ital">he shall show</span> <span class="ital">judgment to the Gentiles, </span> that is, right things, he shall give them his law. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in his name shall the Gentiles trust. The former part of the text is omitted, "he shall not fail, nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth"; but is inserted in Munster's Hebrew Gospel; and which some understand of the bruised reed, and smoking flax, and others of Christ; the latter sense is to be preferred. The passage, here cited, is somewhat different in Isaiah: for there it is, "and the isles shall wait for his law"; but the difference, at least, in sense, is not so great as it may appear at first sight: for,  as Grotius observes, does not always signify "islands", but nations, and countries, that are upon the continent,  <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-5.htm">Genesis 10:5</a> and so might be rightly rendered here, the Gentiles, or "nations"; and by "the name" of Christ is meant his Gospel: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm">Acts 9:15</a> which Isaiah calls his "law": that is, his doctrine, the doctrine of righteousness, life, and salvation by him, which is the ground and foundation of hope, and trust in him; and they that wait for it, may be truly said to hope, or trust in it. This began to have its accomplishment in the Idumeans, Tyrians, and Sidonians, now attending on the ministry of Christ; and has had a greater accomplishment since: the Gospel having been preached in the Gentile world, both upon the main land, and in the isles afar off; whereby multitudes have been brought to hope, and believe in Christ, as their Saviour and Redeemer. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-21.htm" title="And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.">Matthew 12:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τῷ ὀνόματι αὐτοῦ</span>] In Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">לְתוֹרָתוֹ</span>; LXX., <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>.
