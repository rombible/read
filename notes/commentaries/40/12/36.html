Our Lord does not speak, as we might have expected, of “every evil word,” but of “every idle—i.e., useless and purposeless—word,” the random utterances which, as being more spontaneous, betray character more than deliberate speech. Such an “idle word” had been the passing taunt, “He casteth out devils by Beelzebub.” It is not said, however, that for every such random speech a man shall be condemned, but that he shall give an account for it. It will enter into that great total which determines the divine estimate of his character, and, therefore, the issues of the great “day of judgment.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-36.htm" title="But I say to you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment....">Matthew 12:36-37</a></span>. <span class="ital">But I say unto you </span>— You may perhaps think God does not much regard your words, but I assure you, that not only for blasphemous and profane, malicious, false, slanderous, and reviling words, but <span class="ital">for every idle word which men shall speak: </span>for all light, vain, trifling expressions; for all useless, unprofitable conversation, and all discourse uttered without seriousness and caution, and which does not conduce to the glory of God and the good of mankind; <span class="ital">that men shall speak </span>— At any time, or on any occasion, <span class="ital">they shall give an account in the day of judgment </span>— “I cannot think,” says Dr. Doddridge, “that our Lord here uses <span class="greekheb">αργον</span>, <span class="ital">idle, </span>merely to signify <span class="ital">mischievous. </span>We are certainly accountable for <span class="ital">useless </span>as well as <span class="ital">wicked </span>discourses, and they will be taken into that last survey which is to determine our character and state: which they whose life is one continued scene of <span class="ital">whim, </span>or <span class="ital">sneering raillery, </span>would do well seriously to consider. And it was to our Lord’s purpose to observe it here, as it inferred, by the strongest consequence, the danger of such vile and criminal discourses as those of the Pharisees in this case. But discourse tending to exhilarate the spirits is not idle discourse; as the time spent in necessary recreation is not idle time; nor does a wise and gracious God expect from men the life of angels. If any are dissatisfied with the account of things here given, I would beg leave to ask them whether unprofitable talk be not a sinful wasting of time? and whether that must not render a man in some degree criminal before God?” <span class="ital">For by thy words </span>— That is, by the evidence of thy words, as well as of thy tempers and works, <span class="ital">thou shall be justified, </span>&c. — Shalt be either acquitted or condemned; since by the tenor of these the disposition of thy heart is shown, and thy true character discovered.

The heart is the fountain, words are the streams. A troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring, must send forth muddy and unpleasant streams. Nothing but the salt of grace, cast into the spring, will heal the waters, season the speech, and purify the corrupt communication. An evil man has an evil treasure in his heart, and out of it brings forth evil things. Lusts and corruptions, dwelling and reigning in the heart, are an evil treasure, out of which the sinner brings forth bad words and actions, to dishonour God, and hurt others.

Jesus replies, "It was not nothing, and at the great day will not be treated as nothing: Words, as the index of the heart, however idle they may seem, will be taken account of, whether good or bad, in estimating character in the day of judgment."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I say unto you,....

By an "idle word" is meant, what the Jews call, , "light conversation", and , "vain discourse", as the Hebrew Gospel of Munster reads it here; frothy language, unprofitable talk, which, though it does not directly hurt God or man, yet is of no use to speaker or hearer; and yet even this, in the last general and awful judgment, if not forgiven, and repented of, must be accounted for; and much more such horrid blasphemies the Pharisees had vented against Christ, and the Spirit of Christ.
