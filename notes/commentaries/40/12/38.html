Signs were granted to those who desired them to confirm their faith, as Abraham and Gideon; but denied to those who demanded them to excuse their unbelief. The resurrection of Christ from the dead by his own power, called here the sign of the prophet Jonah, was the great proof of Christ's being the Messiah. As Jonah was three days and three nights in the whale, and then came out again alive, thus Christ would be so long in the grave, and then rise again. The Ninevites would shame the Jews for not repenting; the queen of Sheba, for not believing in Christ. And we have no such cares to hinder us, we come not to Christ upon such uncertainties. This parable represents the case of the Jewish church and nation. It is also applicable to all those who hear the word of God, and are in part reformed, but not truly converted. The unclean spirit leaves for a time, but when he returns, he finds Christ is not there to shut him out; the heart is swept by outward reformation, but garnished by preparation to comply with evil suggestions, and the man becomes a more decided enemy of the truth. Every heart is the residence of unclean spirits, except those which are temples of the Holy Ghost, by faith in Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>We would see a sign from thee - See <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/11-29.htm">Luke 11:29-32</a>. A "sign" commonly signifies a miracle - that is, a sign that God was with the person or had sent him. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-11.htm">Isaiah 7:11</a>. Luke adds that this was done "tempting him;" that is, trying him, doubting if he had the power to do it. If these persons had been present with him for any considerable time, they had already seen sufficient proofs that he was what he claimed to be. They might have been, however, those who had recently come, and then the emphasis must be laid on "we" - we, as well as the others, would see a proof that thou art the Christ. In either case it was a temptation. If they had not seen him work a miracle, yet they should have believed it by testimony. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-29.htm">John 20:29</a>. Perhaps, however, the emphasis is to be laid on the words "from heaven." They might profess not to doubt that his miracles were real, but they were not quite satisfactory. They were desirous of seeing something, therefore, that should clear up their doubts - where there could be no opportunity for dispute. A comet, or lightning, or thunder, or sudden darkness, or the gift of food raining upon them, they supposed would be decisive. Possibly they referred in this to Moses. He had been with God amid thunders and lightnings, and he had given them manna - "bread from heaven" to eat. They wished Jesus to show some miracle equally undoubted.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 12:38-50.

This shows that <span class="accented">either</span> the demand was in fact made at some time during this discussion, or at least that it was such a demand as our Lord's opponents were likely to make when they were hard pressed, and such as they did in fact make on a somewhat similar occasion. Notice that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a> it is expressly attributed to others than those who had brought the accusation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> Very similar verses are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a> (parallel passage: <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a> agrees more verbally with the demand as described there than with our ver. 38. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> Thus Mark and Luke relate such an incident once, but Matthew twice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(5)</span> The four passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38-42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16, 29-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a>) contain so much similarity of language that we cannot suppose them to be absolutely independent of each other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(6)</span> Hence two hypotheses present themselves: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> The demand was made twice (in itself exceedingly probable), and our Lord's answers were to a great extent identical in substance (in itself not very probable), and when identical in substance were closely identical in language (distinctly less probable). Or perhaps we might suppose that this identity of language was rather due to the narrator than to our Lord himself; familiarity with one answer may in the curly Church have moulded the record of the other. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> The demand and the answer, as recorded, refer to one and the same occasion. But the account existed in more than one of the sources used by St. Matthew, and as each form of it had its own peculiarities (especially our ver. 24 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-2.htm">Matthew 16:2, 3</a>), he retained them both. Anyhow, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-1.htm">Matthew 16:1-4</a> seems to have belonged to the Framework, and our passage to the Discourses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(7)</span> It will be noticed that all the passages except <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-11.htm">Mark 8:11-13</a> speak of "the sign of Jonah." How was Jonah a sign? Our ver. 40 seems to answer the question, and to say that it was by being in the whale's belly three days and three nights. But there are serious difficulties in accepting this view as finally and alone right. For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-4.htm">Matthew 16:4</a> no explanation at all is recorded (though, indeed, it might be urged that the evangelist might fairly expect his readers to remember our ver. 40), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> apparently a different explanation is found, "for even as Jonah became a sign unto the Ninevites, so shall also the Son of man be to this generation" - words which, taken alone, would seem to refer to Jonah being a sign by the mere fact of his preaching. Thus our Lord would mean - As Jonah preached, so I preach. The future is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-30.htm">Luke 11:30</a> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>), as bringing out  more clearly than the present would have done the final relation in which Christ should stand to his contemporaries. Godet, indeed, urges that the future excludes any present reference to Christ's work as preaching, and that the demand for a sign <span class="accented">from heaven</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>) can only be fully satisfied by Christ's resurrection, "in which no human agency intervenes, and in which Divine power appears alone." He, therefore, makes Luke's meaning identical with that of our ver. 40, and paraphrases thus: "It was as one who had miraculously escaped from death that Jonas presented himself before the Ninevites, summoning them to anticipate the danger which threatened them; it is as the Risen One that I (by my messengers) shall proclaim salvation to the men of this generation." But this would almost assume that Jonah told the Ninevites of his miraculous escape, though there is not a hint of his having done so. On the contrary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-4.htm">Jonah 3:4</a>, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, implies that the call to repentance on the basis of punishment threatened was the sole and only means employed by the prophet to accomplish his mission. Jonah the preacher became, by virtue of his preaching, a sign to the Ninevites (for, quite apart from his miraculous preservation, his appearance in Nineveh and his preaching there were no small portent and sign of Divine interest in the Ninevites' affairs), and they accepted him. Matthew's addition, "the prophet," emphasizes this thought, even though he passes on to give what appears to have been the Lord's secondary interpretation of <span class="accented">the sign of Jonah.</span> Christ's primary object, then, in his reply was to show to his opponents that heathen Ninevites and a heathen queen accepted the truth without any such sign as that which they were now demanding, and, if possible, to shame them into doing so. Thus ver. 40 is to be considered as parenthetical rather than as the main subject. It has, indeed, been suggested that ver. 40 was in fact not spoken at all by the Lord himself, but is only the result of a very early interpretation by the Hebrew Christians of our Lord's phrase, added before the formation of our Gospel. The explanation is tempting, but, in the entire absence of corroboration, cannot be accepted (cf. note there). So far as our present evidence goes, we must attribute ver. 40 to Christ, and consider that as he was mentioning the reception of Jonah by the Ninevites, the thought occurred to him that in Jonah's history lay as it were a prefigurement of what he himself would be. Just as on another occasion he illustrated his death and resurrection by the figure of destroying and building the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-18.htm">John 2:18, 19</a>), so now he uses the figure of Jonah in the whale's belly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(8)</span> This is not the place to enter upon a discussion of the question whether the event here referred to literally happened or not, much less to examine the deep and mysterious subject of the Lord's kenosis (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>). But it should be observed that some at least of those critics who do not believe that the narrative of Jonah being in the whale's belly is to be understood literally, consider that his preaching to the Ninevites at all is equally metaphorical (cf. C. H. H. Wright, 'Introduction to Old Testament,' p. 207, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>), <span class="accented">so</span> that not only ver. 40 but ver. 41 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-32.htm">Luke 11:32</a> are affected, and that indeed more seriously, since the Lord says that the Ninevites will stand up as witnesses. The reasons for taking the narrative as only metaphorical are far from convincing, yet even if they were overwhelming, the illustration in ver. 40 (though not ver. 41) would still remain valid, just as (with all reverence be it spoken) any one to-day might illustrate his action from that of one of Shakespeare's characters whose historical existence is more than doubtful. While, however, the frequency of the allegorical and pictorial in Hebrew poetry and prophecy must be fully allowed for, there seems to be no strong reason (apart from the miracle) to doubt the historical character of the narrative. Further, as to the miracle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-17.htm">Jonah 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/2-10.htm">Jonah 2:10</a> are so closely connected with <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1.htm">Jonah 1, 3</a>, and 4, that it is best to understand the writer as intending to represent it (marvellous though it is) as literal history. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 38-45.</span> - Some of our Lord's opponents try to defend themselves by asking for a sign of his authority to claim so much; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> ver. 30 (ver. 38). In his reply he refers them to their own histories for proof that such a demand is inexcusable. The Ninevites did not require one when Jonah became a sign to them - and in mentioning  Jonah he refers to his being in the whale's belly three days and three nights as a symbol of what should happen to himself - and "the queen of the south" took immense trouble to satisfy her craving after wisdom (vers. 39-42). Therefore let them beware; their present state was one of extreme danger; the improvement that they showed was only negative, and if they did not take care worse would happen to them in the future than in the past (vers. 43-45). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 38.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Then certain</span>. The demand is only made by a portion of those present, who, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-16.htm">Luke 11:16</a>, were not the same as those who spoke our ver. 24. <span class="cmt_word">Of the scribes and of the</span> (Revised Version omits <span class="accented">the</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Pharisees</span>.
