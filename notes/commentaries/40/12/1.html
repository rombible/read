The facts of the case place it clearly between the Passover and the Feast of Pentecost, between the beginning of the barley and the end of the wheat harvest. The position which the narrative occupies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.">Mark 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>, immediately after the feast in Matthew’s house, differs so widely from St. Matthew’s arrangement, that we are again at sea in attempting to construct a harmony, and can only regard the words “at that time” as belonging to the separate history in some other position than that in which he has placed it.<p><span class= "bld">Began to pluck the ears of corn.</span>—Note St. Mark’s stronger phrase, “to make a path, plucking the ears,” and St. Luke’s description that they ate them, “rubbing them in their hands.” The act was permitted by the Law as far as the rights of property were concerned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-25.htm" title="When you come into the standing corn of your neighbor, then you may pluck the ears with your hand; but you shall not move a sickle to your neighbor's standing corn.">Deuteronomy 23:25</a>), but it was against the Pharisees’ interpretation of the law of the Sabbath. To pluck the ears was to reap, to rub the husks from the grain was to thresh; and the new Teacher was therefore, they thought, tacitly sanctioning a distinct breach of the holiness of the day of rest.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.">Matthew 12:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn </span>— The cornfields near Jerusalem, attended by his disciples and some of the Pharisees, whose curiosity, it is probable, prompted them to mix with the crowd on this occasion, in expectation of seeing more miracles. <span class="ital">His disciples began to pluck </span>[and rub in their hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went through the corn fields; and his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and did eat, rubbing them in their hands.">Luke 6:1</a>] <span class="ital">the ears of corn, and to eat </span>— Just what sufficed for present necessity.

This was slender provision for Christ and his disciples; but they were content with it. The Pharisees did not quarrel with them for taking another man's corn, but for doing it on the sabbath day. Christ came to free his followers, not only from the corruptions of the Pharisees, but from their unscriptural rules, and justified what they did. The greatest shall not have their lusts indulged, but the meanest shall have their wants considered. Those labours are lawful on the sabbath day which are necessary, and sabbath rest is to froward, not to hinder sabbath worship. Needful provision for health and food is to be made; but when servants are kept at home, and families become a scene of hurry and confusion on the Lord's day, to furnish a feast for visitors, or for indulgence, the case is very different. Such things as these, and many others common among professors, are to be blamed. The resting on the sabbath was ordained for man's good, De 5:14. No law must be understood so as to contradict its own end. And as Christ is the Lord of the sabbath, it is fit the day and the work of it should be dedicated to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/12-1.htm">Matthew 12:1-8</a>. The account contained in these verses is also recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/2-23.htm">Mark 2:23-28</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1-5</a>.<p>At that time - Luke Luk 6:1 fixes the time more particularly. He says that it was "the second Sabbath after the first." To understand this, it is proper to remark that the "Passover" was observed during the month "Abib," or Nisan, answering to the latter part of March and the first of April. The feast was held seven days, commencing on the fourteenth day of the month <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/12-1.htm">Exodus 12:1-28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>, on the "second" day of the paschal week. The law required that a sheaf of "barley" should be offered up as the first-fruits of the harvest, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm">Leviticus 23:10-11</a>. From this day was reckoned seven weeks to the feast of "Pentecost" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-15.htm">Leviticus 23:15-16</a>, called also the feast of weeks <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10</a>, and the feast of the harvest, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-16.htm">Exodus 23:16</a>. This second day in the feast of the Passover, or of unleavened bread, was the beginning, therefore, from which they reckoned toward the Pentecost. The Sabbath in the week following would be the "second Sabbath" after this first one in the reckoning, and this was doubtless the time mentioned when Christ went through the fields. It should be further mentioned, that in Judea the barley harvest commences about the beginning of May, and both that and the wheat harvest are over by the twentieth. Barley is in full ear in the beginning of April. There is no improbability, therefore, in this narrative on account of the season of the year. This feast was always held at Jerusalem.<p>Through the corn - Through the "barley," or "wheat." The word "corn," as used in our translation of the Bible, has no reference to "maize," or "Indian corn," as it has with us. Indian corn was unknown until the discovery of America, and it is scarcely probable that the translators knew anything about it. The word "corn" was applied, as it is still in England, to wheat, rye, oats, and barley. This explains the circumstance that they "rubbed it in their hands" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-1.htm">Luke 6:1</a> to separate the grain from the chaff. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 12<p>Mt 12:1-8. Plucking Corn Ears on the Sabbath Day. ( = Mr 2:23-28; Lu 6:1-5).<p>The season of the year when this occurred is determined by the event itself. Ripe corn ears are found in the fields only just before harvest. The barley harvest seems clearly intended here, at the close of our March and beginning of our April. It coincided with the Passover season, as the wheat harvest with Pentecost. But in Luke (Lu 6:1) we have a still more definite note of time, if we could be certain of the meaning of the peculiar term which he employs to express it. "It came to pass (he says) on the sabbath, which was the first-second," for that is the proper rendering of the word, and not "the second sabbath after the first," as in our version. Of the various conjectures what this may mean, that of Scaliger is the most approved, and, as we think, the freest from difficulty, namely, the first sabbath after the second day of the Passover; that is, the first of the seven sabbaths which were to be reckoned from the second day of the Passover, which was itself a sabbath, until the next feast, the feast of Pentecost (Le 23:15, 16; De 16:9, 10) In this case, the day meant by the Evangelist is the first of those seven sabbaths intervening between Passover and Pentecost. And if we are right in regarding the "feast" mentioned in Joh 5:1 as a Passover, and consequently the second during our Lord's public ministry (see on [1268]Joh 5:1), this plucking of the ears of corn must have occurred immediately after the scene and the discourse recorded in Joh 5:19-47, which, doubtless, would induce our Lord to hasten His departure for the north, to avoid the wrath of the Pharisees, which He had kindled at Jerusalem. Here, accordingly, we find Him in the fields&#8212;on His way probably to Galilee.<p>1. At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn&#8212;"the cornfields" (Mr 2:23; Lu 6:1).<p>and his disciples were an hungered&#8212;not as one may be before his regular meals; but evidently from shortness of provisions: for Jesus defends their plucking the corn-ears and eating them on the plea of necessity.<p>and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat&#8212;"rubbing them in their hands" (Lu 6:1).<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat....">Matthew 12:1-8</a></span> Christ alleges scripture in excuse of his disciples,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>whom the Pharisees charged with breaking the sabbath<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>in plucking the ears of corn on the sabbath day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-9.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he went into their synagogue:...">Matthew 12:9-13</a></span> He appeals to reason, and healeth the withered hand<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>on the sabbath day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-14.htm" title="Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him, how they might destroy him....">Matthew 12:14-21</a></span> The Pharisees seek to destroy him: a prophecy of<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Esaias fulfilled in him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22</a>,23</span> He healeth one possessed of a devil, who was blind<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and dumb,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils....">Matthew 12:24-37</a></span> and confuting the absurd charge of his casting out<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>devils by Beelzebub, he showeth that blasphemy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>against the Holy Ghost is an unpardonable sin, and<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>that every idle word must be accounted for.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you....">Matthew 12:38-45</a></span> He rebuketh those that sought of him a sign,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-46.htm" title="While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood without, desiring to speak with him....">Matthew 12:46-50</a></span> and showeth whom he regardeth as his nearest relations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Mark relating this story, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-23.htm" title="And it came to pass, that he went through the corn fields on the sabbath day; and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of corn.">Mark 2:23</a></span>, varies little.

The Pharisees therefore do not accuse them of theft, but of violation of the sabbath. Luke saith this happened upon the second sabbath after the first. Whether that was the sabbath next following the feast of unleavened bread, (which was about the time of our Easter), the first and last days of which were sabbaths in the Jewish sense, or the feast of tabernacles, or any other, is not much material for us to know. But on a sabbath day it was that our Saviour <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">went through the corn, and his disciples were an hungred:</span> this may teach us their low estate and condition in the world. He could quickly have supplied their hunger, but he chose to leave them to relieve themselves with plucking, rubbing, and eating of the corn, that he might have an opportunity to instruct them and the Pharisees in the true doctrine of the sabbath. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn,.... That is, the corn fields, as the other evangelists express it. It being on a sabbath day, it is very probable, that Christ and his disciples were going to some public place of worship, the way to which lay through some fields of corn, which were now ripe: for Luke says, it was on the "second sabbath after the first", or rather "the first sabbath after the second"; that is, the first sabbath after the second day of the passover, when the sheaf of the first fruit was offered, and harvest was begun. <p>And his disciples were an hungered; it being in the morning before they had broke their fast; and this circumstance is mentioned to show the reason of the following action, and to excuse it: at which the Pharisees were so much offended, and of which they accused them, as having done what was very criminal: <p>and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat; Luke adds, "rubbing them in their hands"; and so here in the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, it is rendered, "they began to rub": as they passed along, they plucked off the ears of corn, either barley or wheat, and rubbed them in their hands, to get the grain clear of the husk, or beard, and eat them; contenting themselves with such mean and unprepared food, when the Jews on that day fed on the best of dainties (e). <p>(e) Vid.
