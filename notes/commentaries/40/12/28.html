The second hymn in the Ordination Service reproduces the symbolism in the words addressed to the Holy Spirit—<p>“In faithful hearts thou writ’st thy law,<p>The finger of God’s hand;”<p>and it obviously connects itself with the older language which describes the Ten Commandments as written on the two tables of stone with “the finger of God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-18.htm" title="And he gave to Moses, when he had made an end of communing with him on mount Sinai, two tables of testimony, tables of stone, written with the finger of God.">Exodus 31:18</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span>—The word describes a coming suddenly, unlooked for, sooner than men expected. The argument may be briefly formulated thus:—The work was confessedly superhuman, either from the power of Satan or that of God, but the former hypothesis was excluded by the reasoning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-25.htm" title="And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:">Matthew 12:25-27</a>; the latter was therefore the only explanation. But if so, if Jesus gave proof that He was thus filled with the power of the Spirit to heal and save, then He was what He claimed to be, the Head of the divine kingdom. That kingdom had burst upon men unawares.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God ... - The Spirit of God, here, means the "power" of God - in Luke, by the "finger" of God.<p>Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm">Exodus 8:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-3.htm">Psalm 8:3</a>.

But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God&#8212;In Luke (Lu 11:20) it is, "with (or 'by') the finger of God."

But where had the force of this argument been, if the Jews had had exorcists whom God had so honoured, though vagabonds, as to cast out devils, upon their calling upon the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, while in the mean time they derided and contemned Christ? <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God,.... As it was certain he did, from the nature, use, and design of such miracles; and it could not be reasonably thought, that Satan would assist in what was so very opposite to his kingdom and interest, and was so serviceable to the cause and glory of Christ. All the three persons had an hand in the miracles of the Messiah; they were done by Christ, in his Father's name, and by the power of the Spirit of God; from which the following inference may be justly deduced, <p>then the kingdom of God is come unto you: meaning, either the Messiah himself; or rather, his kingdom, the Gospel dispensation, which both Christ and John had declared to be at hand; of which the performing of miracles, particularly the casting out of devils, whereby the kingdom of Satan was so much weakened, was a clear proof. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come unto you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>.

Luke has <span class="greekheb">ἐν δακτύλῳ θ</span>. The former seems more in keeping with the connection of thought as defending the ethical character of Christ’s work assailed by the Pharisees. If, indeed, the spirit of God were regarded from the <span class="ital">charismatic</span> point of view, as the source of miraculous gifts, the two expressions would be synonymous. But there is reason to believe that by the time our Gospel was written the Pauline conception of the Holy Spirit’s influence as chiefly <span class="ital">ethical</span> and <span class="ital">immanent</span>, as distinct from that of the primitive apostolic church, in which it was charismatic and transcendent, had gained currency (<span class="ital">vide</span> my <span class="ital">St. Paul’s Conception of Christianity</span>, chap. xiii.). A trace of the new Pauline view may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-20.htm" title="For it is not you that speak, but the Spirit of your Father which speaks in you.">Matthew 10:20</a> : “It is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking in you”. The influence is <span class="ital">within</span>, and the product is not unintelligible utterance, like that of the speaker with tongues (1 Corinthians 12, 14), but wise, sincere apology for the faith. But why then did Luke not adopt this Pauline phrase? Because one of his main aims was to bring out the miraculousness of Christ’s healing works; that they were done by the very finger of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-19.htm" title="Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he listened not to them; as the LORD had said.">Exodus 8:19</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ἔφθασεν</span>. Fritzsche takes this word strictly as signifying not merely: the kingdom of God has come nigh you (<span class="greekheb">ἤγγικεν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-9.htm" title="And heal the sick that are therein, and say to them, The kingdom of God is come near to you.">Luke 10:9</a>), but: has come nigh sooner than you expected. The more general sense, however, seems most suitable, as it is the usual sense in the N. T. The point at issue was: do the events in question mean Satan’s kingdom come or God’s kingdom come?

Observe that this could not be affirmed from the success of the Pharisees' disciples, for with them expulsion of devils, even if it were real, was, as it were, accidental, standing in no close connexion with their work (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-22.htm">Matthew 7:22</a>, note).
