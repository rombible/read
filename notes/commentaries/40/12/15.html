Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself ... - He knew of the plot which they had formed against his life; but his hour was not yet come, and he therefore sought security.<p>By remaining, his presence would only have provoked them further and endangered his own life. He acted, therefore, the part of prudence and withdrew. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-23.htm">Matthew 10:23</a>.<p>Mark adds that he withdrew "to the sea;" that is, to the Sea of Galilee. or Tiberias. He states also <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm">Matthew 3:7-8</a> that "a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea, and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they heard what great things he did, came unto him." As some of these places were without the limits of Judea or inhabited by "Gentiles," this statement of Mark throws light on the passage quoted by Matthew Mat 12:21, "In his name shall the Gentiles trust."<p>Pressed by the crowd <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-9.htm">Mark 3:9</a>, Jesus went aboard a "small vessel," or "boat," called by Mark a "ship." This he did for the convenience of being separated from them and more easily addressing them. We are to suppose the lake still and calm; the multitudes, most of whom were sick and diseased, on the shore and pressing to the water's edge; and Jesus thus healing their diseases, and preaching to them the good news of salvation. No scene could be more sublime than this.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence&#8212;whither, our Evangelist says not; but Mark (Mr 3:7) says "it was to the sea"&#8212;to some distance, no doubt, from the scene of the miracle, the madness, and the plotting just recorded.<p>and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all&#8212;Mark gives the following interesting details: "A great multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things He did, came unto Him. And He spake to His disciples, that a small ship"&#8212;or "wherry"&#8212;"should wait on Him because of the multitude, lest they should throng Him. For He had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon Him for to touch Him, as many as had plagues. And unclean spirits, when they saw Him, fell down before Him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. And He straitly charged them that they should not make Him known" (Mr 3:7-12). How glorious this extorted homage to the Son of God! But as this was not the time, so neither were they the fitting preachers, as Bengel says. (See on [1271]Mr 1:25, and compare Jas 2:19). Coming back now to our Evangelist: after saying, "He healed them all," he continues:<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But when Jesus knew it,.... Their consultation against him, as he did, not by any discovery made to him by men, but as the omniscient God; he withdrew himself from thence; from the synagogue and city, where he was, to the sea of Galilee, and his disciples with him, as Mark observes; not through fear, but because his time was not yet come, that he must suffer and die for his people; he had some other work to do first, and therefore rightly and wisely provides for his safety. And great multitudes followed him; from Galilee, Judea, Jerusalem, Idumea, and from beyond Jordan; and were joined by another multitude of people, who came from about Tyre and Sidon, as Mark relates: so that his departure was not so very private; nor was he forsaken by the common people, though the Pharisees were so offended with him. And he healed them all; that stood in need of healing, as many as had plagues and unclean spirits; practising agreeably to his doctrine, that it was lawful to do good on the sabbath day, and to heal the bodies as well as the souls of men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-15.htm" title="But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;">Matthew 12:15</a> ff. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,...">Matthew 12:17-21</a> are peculiar to Matthew.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">αὐτοὺς πάντας</span>] all the sick who were among the multitudes.

The sequel of the Sabbatic encounter is very vague. The one fact outstanding and noteworthy is the withdrawal of Jesus, conscious of having given deep offence, but anxious to avoid tragic consequences for the present. It is to that fact mainly that the evangelist attaches his fair picture of Jesus, in prophetic language. It is happily brought in here, where it gains by the contrast between the real Jesus and Jesus as conceived by the Pharisees, a miscreant deserving to die. It is not necessary to suppose that the historical basis of the picture is to be found exclusively in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-15.htm" title="But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from there: and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;...">Matthew 12:15-16</a>, all the more that the statement they contain is but a meagre reproduction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/3-7.htm" title="But Jesus withdrew himself with his disciples to the sea: and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judaea,...">Mark 3:7-12</a>, omitting some valuable material, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the demoniac cry: “Thou art the Son of God”. The historic features answering to the prophetic outline in the evangelist’s mind may be taken from the whole story of Christ’s public life as hitherto told, from the baptism onwards. Luke gives his picture of Jesus at the beginning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/4-16.htm" title="The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up....">Matthew 4:16-25</a>) as a frontispiece, Matthew places his at the end of a considerable section of the story, at a critical turning point in the history, and he means the reader to look back over the whole for verification. Thus for the evangelist <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a> may point back to the baptism (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-13.htm" title="Then comes Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be baptized of him....">Matthew 3:13-17</a>), when the voice from heaven called Jesus God’s beloved Son; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a> to the teaching on the hill (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?...">Matthew 12:5-7</a>), when the voice of Jesus was heard not in the street but on the mountain top, remote from the crowd below; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-20.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment to victory.">Matthew 12:20</a> to the healing ministry among the sick, physically bruised reeds, poor suffering creatures in whom the flame of life burnt low; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-21.htm" title="And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.">Matthew 12:21</a> to such significant incidents as that of the centurion of Capernaum (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/8-5.htm" title="And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came to him a centurion, beseeching him,...">Matthew 8:5-13</a>). Broad interpretation here seems best. Some features, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the reference to judgment, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-20.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment to victory.">Matthew 12:20</a>, second clause, are not to be pressed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The quotation is a very free reproduction from the Hebrew, with occasional side glances at the Sept[73] It has been suggested that the evangelist drew neither from the Hebrew nor from the Sept[74], but from a Chaldee Targum in use in his time (Lutteroth). It is certainly curious that he should have omitted <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-4.htm" title="He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.">Isaiah 42:4</a>, “He shall not fail nor be discouraged,” etc., a most important additional feature in the picture = Messiah shall not only not break the bruised reed, but He shall not be Himself a bruised reed, but shall bravely stand for truth and right till they at length triumph. Admirable historic materials to illustrate that prophetic trait are ready to our hand in Christ’s encounters with the Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-1.htm" title="And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his own city....">Matthew 9:1-17</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat....">Matthew 12:1-13</a>). Either Matthew has followed a Targum, or been misled by the similarity of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-3.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment to truth....">Isaiah 42:3-4</a>, or he means <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-20.htm" title="A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench, till he send forth judgment to victory.">Matthew 12:20</a> to bear a double reference, and read: He shall neither <span class="ital">break</span> nor <span class="ital">be</span> a bruised reed, nor allow to be quenched either in others or in Himself the feeble flame: a strong, brave, buoyant, ever-victorious hero, helper of the weak, Him self a stranger to weakness.—<span class="greekheb">ᾑρέτισα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>), an Ionic form in use in Hellenistic Greek, here only in N.
