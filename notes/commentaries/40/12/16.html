Here the generalised character of the command leads us to look for another explanation. The hour of final conflict and suffering had not yet come, and Jesus would not hasten it. The clouds were gathering, but the night had not yet come, and He sought to work while it was yet day, and therefore (again giving an example of His own precept that His disciples should be “wise as serpents and harmless as doves,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-16.htm" title="Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the middle of wolves: be you therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.">Matthew 10:16</a>) sought to avoid premature occasions of offence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:...">Matthew 12:16-21</a>. </span><span class="ital">And charged them that they should not make him known </span>— Partly that he might avoid the envy and rage of his persecutors, and partly because the time was not yet come for him to declare himself openly to be the Messiah. <span class="ital">That it might be fulfilled, </span>&c. — Here the evangelist assigns another reason why the Lord Jesus prosecuted his ministry in this humble, meek, quiet, and unostentatious way: it was, that he might fulfil Isaiah’s prophecy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles....">Isaiah 42:1-4</a>, in which it was foretold that he should conduct himself in this manner. It must be observed, that the passage here referred to is not quoted exactly according to the Hebrew original, the evangelist contenting himself with giving us the substance of it in a contracted form: nor is it quoted according to the version of the LXX., who have given but a very indifferent interpretation of it. <span class="ital">He shall show judgment </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">κρισις</span>, <span class="ital">judgment, </span>here used by Matthew, answers to <span class="greekheb">משּׁפט</span>, in the prophet, a word which, in the Old Testament, is often put for the laws of God in general. And by Christ’s <span class="ital">showing judgment to the Gentiles, </span>is evidently meant his declaring the laws of religion, the eternal rules of righteousness, or the will of his heavenly Father, not only to the single nation of the Jews, but also, and especially, to the Gentile nation. <span class="ital">He shall not strive, nor cry, </span>&c. — He shall not be contentious, noisy, or ostentatious; but gentle, quiet, and lowly. <span class="ital">A bruised reed shall he not break </span>— Such as are convinced of their sinfulness and guilt, and bruised under the weight thereof. <span class="ital">Smoking flax shall he not quench </span>— The least good desire, the faintest spark of grace. He alludes to the wick of a lamp when it is first beginning to kindle, and is put out by any little motion. <span class="ital">Till he send forth judgment unto victory </span>— Till he make righteousness completely victorious over all its enemies. <span class="ital">And in his name, </span>that is, in him, <span class="ital">shall the Gentiles trust, </span>for salvation, present and eternal. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-1.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I uphold; my elect, in whom my soul delights; I have put my spirit on him: he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles.">Isaiah 42:1</a>; where the original passage is explained at large.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:14-21 The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And he charged them ... - He was "at this time" desirous of concealment.<p>He wished to avoid their plots and to save his life.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

The charge he gives is the same which we have often met with, of which no satisfactory account can be given, further than that, knowing his time was not yet come, and he had much work to do before his death, he useth all prudent means to preserve his life, reserving himself for the further work which his Father left him to do. The publishing of his miracles would have made a great noise, and possibly have more enraged the Pharisees against him; neither did he seek his own glory, but the glory of him that sent him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And charged them that they should not make him known. This charge was given, either to the multitude that followed him, and were healed by him, that when they returned to the respective places from whence they came, they would not make it known to his enemies where he was, and what he had done to them; being neither desirous of popular applause and glory, nor willing to provoke them more, nor to fall into their hands as yet; or else, as Mark seems to intimate, to the unclean spirits, that they would not declare who he was, the Son of God, they confessed him to be: and very likely it was given to both, and that they should neither tell where he was, nor who he was; and this charge was a very severe one; for the word signifies a charge with threatenings, should they not observe his orders. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And charged them that they should not make him known:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/12.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἵνα μὴ</span>, <span class="ital">that they should not</span>) Such was the authority of Jesus, even commanding silence to the multitude.[558]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[558] <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,">Matthew 12:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὅπως πληρωθῇ</span>) The calm (placid) and most salutary mode of action, which Jesus employed, is intimated by these words.—<span class="ital">Vers.
