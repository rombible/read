In each of these aspects the words of Isaiah found their highest fulfilment in the Son of Man. In referring these words to the Messiah, the Evangelist was following in the footsteps of the Chaldee Paraphrase, but we must remember also that the words recorded as heard at the Baptism of Jesus (almost verbally identical with those of the prophecy now cited) must also have suggested the application, especially as connected with the promise, “I will put My Spirit upon Him,” which had then received its fulfilment.<p><span class= "bld">He shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.</span>—The word “judgment” has a wide range of meaning in the Hebrew of Isaiah, and includes the work of a king, as teaching, no less than as executing, righteousness. As yet, of course, the work of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles had not begun, but St. Matthew notes, as it were, by anticipation, the spirit of love and gentleness which, when he wrote his Gospel, had brought them also within the range of the judgments—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the life-giving truths—of the righteous Judge. It is one of the many instances in which his record, though obviously written for Jews, is yet emphatically a Gospel for the Gentiles.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:14-21 The Pharisees took counsel to find some accusation, that Jesus might be condemned to death. Aware of their design, as his time was not come, he retired from that place. Face does not more exactly answer to face in water, than the character of Christ drawn by the prophet, to his temper and conduct as described by the evangelists. Let us with cheerful confidence commit our souls to so kind and faithful a Friend. Far from breaking, he will strengthen the bruised reed; far from quenching the smoking flax, or wick nearly out, he will rather blow it up into a flame. Let us lay aside contentious and angry debates; let us receive one another as Christ receives us. And while encouraged by the gracious kindness of our Lord, we should pray that his Spirit may rest upon us, and make us able to copy his example.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My servant - That is, the Messiah, the Lord Jesus; called a servant from his taking the "form" of a "servant," or his being born in a humble condition <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-7.htm">Philippians 2:7</a>, and from his obeying or "serving" God.

My beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased; who always was the object of his love, not only as his own and only begotten Son, but as in his office capacity, as mediator; in regard to which he was his elect, as it is in Isaiah; and, as such, he was always delighted in his person, well pleased with his office, and the discharge of it, and which he declared more than once by a voice from heaven, as at his baptism, and at his transfiguration on the mount: I will put my Spirit upon him; as he did without measure, whereby he was abundantly qualified for his whole work, and particularly for preaching the Gospel, being richly anointed with gifts and graces, above his fellows; of which the descent of the Holy Spirit upon him, as a dove at his baptism, which immediately preceded his public ministry, was a symbol. And he shall show judgment unto the Gentiles; meaning, not the general judgment, at the last day, which is committed to him; nor the laws of Justice and equity; but the Gospel, which is the produce of the God of judgment; best informs the judgment of men about the business of salvation; gives an account of the righteous procedure of God in justifying sinners, by the righteousness of his Son; and teaches men to live soberly, righteously, and godly: this Christ brought forth, and showed, at this time, to the Heathens, the Idumeans, Tyrians, and Sidonians; who flocked unto him; whereby this part of the prophecy had its fulfilment: in the Hebrew it is, "he shall bring forth"; that is, out of his heart and mouth, and is the same as "show" here. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he shall shew <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> judgment to the Gentiles.</span><p>(c) By judgment is meant a godly kingdom, because Christ was to proclaim true religion among the Gentiles, and to cast out superstition; and wherever this is done, the Lord is said to reign and judge there, that is to say, to govern and rule matters.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-18.htm" title="Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit on him, and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.">Matthew 12:18</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-1.htm" title="Comfort you, comfort you my people, said your God.">Isaiah 40:1</a> ff., a very free rendering of the original Hebrew text, yet not without some reminiscences of the LXX.

Matthew’s Greek expression is doubtless to be understood no less in the sense of a judicial sentence, i.e. the Messianic judgment, for which the Messiah is preparing the way through His whole ministry, and which is to be consummated at the last day.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἔθνεσιν</span>] not: the nations, generally, but the heathen. Similarly also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-21.htm" title="And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.">Matthew 12:21</a>. The point of fulfilment in the prediction here quoted lies simply in its serving to describe, as it does in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-19.htm" title="He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his voice in the streets.">Matthew 12:19</a> f., the unostentatious, meek, and gentle nature of Christ’s ministry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-16.htm" title="And charged them that they should not make him known:">Matthew 12:16</a>), so that it is unnecessary to look to what precedes in order to find something corresponding to <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἔθνεσι</span> (some finding it in the multitudes that followed Jesus).

It should be observed generally, and especially in the case of somewhat lengthened quotations from the Old Testament, that it is not intended that every detail is to find its corresponding fulfilment, but that such fulfilment is to be looked for only in connection with that which the connection shows to be the main subject under consideration.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">my servant</span>] Israel as a nation is called the servant of Jehovah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>.

Primarily, as would appear, Israel in its ideal, up to which true Israelites came in measure, but only One came fully. <span class="cmt_word">Whom</span> I <span class="cmt_word">have chosen </span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;</span>). The Hebrew denotes "lay hold of" (<span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x5de;&#x5d3;</span>), <span class="accented">i.e.</span> for myself. Bengel has a beautiful note on the <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f45;&#x3bd;</span> of the Received Text, "<span class="greek">&#x391;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">in</span>, denotat perpeluam mentis paternae tendentiam erga dilectum, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-17.htm">2 Peter 1:17</a>." According to the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-1.htm">1 Chronicles 29:1</a>, David's expression about Solomon affords a curious parallel, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x39a;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (edit. Dr. Swete). But Lagarde's edition of the Lucianic text punctuates and accents differently, <span class="greek">&#x1f49;&#x20;&#x3c5;&#x1f31;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x7b;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f91;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, and this is much nearer to the Hebrew. <span class="cmt_word">My beloved, in whom my soul is well</span> <span class="cmt_word">pleased</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>, note): <span class="cmt_word">I will put my Spirit upon him, and he shall show</span> (declare, Revised Version) <span class="cmt_word">judgment to the Gentiles</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>). Although <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> usually represents in the New Testament God's decision as to the character and life of men, it here must be understood, like <span class="accented">mishpat</span> in the original, of the Divine right as made known to them for their acceptance and imitation. It is "the true religion viewed on its practical side as a norm and standard for life in all its relations" (Delitzsch). The thought here, therefore, is not of Christ's power to punish and avenge (though he refused to use it as yet), but of his bringing a revelation which should eventually spread, not only to the Jews who now rejected him, but to the Gentiles whom they despised. </body></html>
