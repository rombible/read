The goods or vessels belonging to the strong one are the wicked, called Satan’s vessels metaphorically, as Paul is called Christ’s chosen vessel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-15.htm" title="But the Lord said to him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:">Acts 9:15</a>.

In other words, there are no neuters in this war: every one must be either with Christ or against him; either a loyal subject or a rebel; and there are none upon earth who neither promote nor obstruct his kingdom. For every one does either one or the other daily. Much more criminal and fatal, then, must the character and conduct of those be, who, with deliberate, implacable malice, oppose Christ’s cause, and are resolved, at all adventures, to do their utmost to bring it down, as the Pharisees were now attempting to do by these vile suggestions, whereby they endeavoured to represent Christ, who came to save men, as an accomplice with Satan, who was labouring to destroy them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:22-30 A soul under Satan's power, and led captive by him, is blind in the things of God, and dumb at the throne of grace; sees nothing, and says nothing to the purpose. Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Or else ... - The Saviour makes use of a new illustration to confute the Pharisees, drawn from breaking into a house.<p>A man could not break into the house of a strong man and take his property unless he had rendered the man himself helpless. If he had taken his goods, it would therefore be sufficient proof that he had bound the man. So I, says he, have taken this "property - this possessed person" - from the dominion of Satan. It is clear proof that I have subdued "Satan himself," the "strong" being that had him in possession. The words "or else" mean "or how:" "How, or in what way, can one, etc."<p>Spoil his goods - The word "spoil" commonly means, now, to corrupt, injure, or destroy. Here it means "to plunder," to take with violence, as it commonly does in the Bible. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-22.htm">Exodus 3:22</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Our Saviour showeth how his casting out of devils by the Spirit and power of God argued that the Messiah was come, and the time come when God would set up his kingdom amongst men. The devil, (saith he), who is the god of the world, and the prince of the power of the air, is very strong; there is none, save God only, who is stronger than he. If I were not God, I could never cast out this strong man, who reigns in the world as in his house; as you see amongst men, the strong man is not overcome but by one stronger. He by this also lets them know, that he was so far from any covenant or compact with Beelzebub, that he came into the world a professed enemy to him, to dispossess him of that tyrannical power he exercised amongst men, by his keeping them in darkness, blinding them with error and superstition, and seducing them to sinful practices, till God, for their prodigious sins, had also given him a power over their bodies, variously to vex, afflict, and torment them. Christ took from this strong man all his armour: by scattering the darkness which was in the world by the full revelation of gospel truth: by expelling error and superstition, teaching people the truths of God, and the right way of his worship: by taking away the guilt, and destroying the power of sin and death, ignorance, error, profaneness; the sense of the guilt of sin, and the power of lusts within us, being the devil’s armour, by which he kept up his power, and doth yet keep up what dominion he hath in the world. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Or else, how can anyone enter into a strong man's house,.... This is another argument of Christ's proving that his casting out of devils could not be by Satan, but by the Spirit of God; for if he did not act by any superior power to Satan's, and such by which he was able to master, overcome, and bind him, he could never <p>spoil his goods, as he did; or dispossess devils out of the bodies or souls of men: just as if a man should enter into another man's house, who is strong and robust, with a design to spoil his goods, who would never make use of the man himself to do it, and can never be thought to effect it, unless he has a power superior to his, and uses it; <p>except he first bind the strong man, and then he will spoil his house: by the "strong man", is meant the devil, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-24.htm">Isaiah 49:24</a> who is powerful and mighty, as appears from his nature, being an angel, though a fallen one, excelling in strength human creatures; from his names, such as the roaring lion, the great red dragon, leviathan, &amp;c. from the extent of his dominion, here called "his house"; which reaches to the whole posse of devils, and world of men; whence he is called the prince of the power of the air, and the prince of this world, and the god of it; and from his works and actions, in and over the bodies and estates of men, by divine permission; which might be exemplified in the case of Job, and the demoniacs in the time of Christ; and in and over the souls of men, not only over wicked men, but men under a show of religion, as antichrist and his followers; yea, saints themselves, and even over Adam in a state of innocence; but Christ is stronger than he, and attacked him, and dispossessed him of the bodies of men; and restraining him from doing them any hurt, enters into the souls of men, dethrone him, and leads him captive, who led others; and keeps him from doing them any damage; as he will in the latter day "bind" him and shut him up in prison a thousand years; and also "spoils his goods", or "vessels", and "his house"; the palace of Satan, by taking bodies and souls out of his possession; by awakening the conscience, enlightening the mind, working upon the affections, subduing the will, and implanting principles of grace and holiness in the heart; and so making it a fit habitation for God, which spoils it for the devil: in all which, Satan can never be thought to have any hand; and therefore the suggestion that Christ casts out devils by his assistance, even out of the bodies of men, has no show of reason in it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/12.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-29.htm" title="Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he will spoil his house.">Matthew 12:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἤ</span>] Transition by way of proceeding to give further proof of the actual state of the case.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ</span>] The article indicates the <span class="ital">particular</span> strong man (hero) with whom the <span class="greekheb">τίς</span> has to do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The thought embodied in this illustration is as follows: <span class="ital">Or</span>—if you still hesitate to admit the inference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm" title="But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God is come to you.">Matthew 12:28</a>—<span class="ital">how is it possible for me to despoil Satan of his servants and instruments</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ</span> corresponding to the <span class="ital">demons</span> in the <span class="ital">application</span>)—withdraw them from his control—<span class="ital">without having first of all conquered him?</span> Does my casting out of demons not prove that I have subdued Satan,—have deprived him of his power, just as it is necessary to bind a strong man before plundering his house?
