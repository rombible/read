St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-14.htm" title="And he was casting out a devil, and it was dumb. And it came to pass, when the devil was gone out, the dumb spoke; and the people wondered.">Luke 11:14</a>) places it after the feeding of the five thousand; St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm" title="And the scribes which came down from Jerusalem said, He has Beelzebub, and by the prince of the devils casts he out devils.">Mark 3:22</a>) immediately after the mission of the Twelve. A like narrative has met us in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm" title="As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.">Matthew 9:32</a>, and it is probable enough that the charge was repeated as often as the occasion presented itself, and as often answered in identical or like words. St. Mark states that the Pharisees who brought it were those who had come down from Jerusalem, and this falls in with all that we have seen of the activity of those emissaries of the party.<p><span class= "bld">Possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb.</span>—In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm" title="As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man possessed with a devil.">Matthew 9:32</a>, the man was simply dumb; here the phenomena of the suspension of conscious sensation and volition were more complicated.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw....">Matthew 12:22-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then was brought unto him — </span>Namely, By the person’s friends, <span class="ital">one possessed with a devil, blind and dumb </span>— Many, no doubt, supposed these defects to be merely natural: but the Spirit of God saw otherwise, and gives the true account, both of the disorder and the cure.

Satan blinds the eyes by unbelief, and seals up the lips from prayer. The more people magnified Christ, the more desirous the Pharisees were to vilify him. It was evident that if Satan aided Jesus in casting out devils, the kingdom of hell was divided against itself; how then could it stand! And if they said that Jesus cast out devils by the prince of the devils, they could not prove that their children cast them out by any other power. There are two great interests in the world; and when unclean spirits are cast out by the Holy Spirit, in the conversion of sinners to a life of faith and obedience, the kingdom of God is come unto us. All who do not aid or rejoice in such a change are against Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm">Matthew 4:24</a>.

A Blind and Dumb Demoniac Healed and Reply to the Malignant Explanation Put upon It. ( = Mr 3:20-30; Lu 11:14-23).<p>The precise time of this section is uncertain. Judging from the statements with which Mark introduces it, we should conclude that it was when our Lord's popularity was approaching its zenith, and so before the feeding of the five thousand. But, on the other hand, the advanced state of the charges brought against our Lord, and the plainness of His warnings and denunciations in reply, seem to favor the later period at which Luke introduces it. "And the multitude," says Mark (Mr 3:20, 21), "cometh together again," referring back to the immense gathering which Mark had before recorded (Mr 2:2)&#8212;"so that they could not so much as eat bread. And when His friends"&#8212;or rather, "relatives," as appears from Mt 12:31, and see on [1273]Mt 12:46&#8212;"heard of it, they went out to lay hold on Him; for they said, He is beside Himself." Compare 2Co 5:13, "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God."<p>22.

We heard before a discourse of such as were possessed by devils, so as this verse affords nothing new. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil,.... About this time, or some little time after, when he was returned from the sea of Galilee, and was come into a certain house; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-19.htm">Mark 3:19</a> some persons brought him a demoniac, in compassion to the possessed man, and being persuaded of the power of Christ to heal him by the late cures he had performed. A like instance we have in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-32.htm">Matthew 9:32</a>, which had a like effect upon the people, and cavilled at by the Pharisees in much the same way; and which cavils were answered in much the same words; and yet the case is not the same; for that man was only dumb, but this both <p>blind and dumb; not by birth, or through the defect of nature, or by any natural distemper that had attended him, but through the malice of Satan, by divine permission; his blindness, and dumbness, were the effects of his being possessed with a devil, who had deprived him of his sight, and speech. The word rendered "dumb", signifies both deaf and dumb, and answers to the Hebrew word  which sometimes (m) is used of a deaf man only, who can speak, but not hear; and often of one that can neither speak, nor hear; which is the case of such as are born deaf: it seems as if this man could hear, though he could not speak; since no mention is made of his want of hearing, or of Christ's restoring it to him; for it follows, <p>and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb, both spake and saw. This he did, not by making use of medicines, but by a word speaking, dispossessing Satan; so that the cause of blindness and dumbness being removed, the effects ceased, and the man was restored to his sight, and speech, as before. He had his sight to behold his Saviour, and a tongue to praise his name: so when men are turned from Satan unto God, and are delivered from his thraldom and bondage, they are brought into marvellous light, and put into a capacity of showing forth the praises of God. <p>(m) Maimon. &amp; Bartenora in Misn.

The term Beelzebul, used in this connection as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm" title="But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.">Matthew 9:34</a>, is one, however, which may have been found often enough upon the lips of the Pharisees.
