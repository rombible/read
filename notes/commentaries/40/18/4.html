For a man to “humble himself” with the purpose of attaining greatness would frustrate itself, and reduce humility to an hypocrisy. The “pride that apes humility,” the false lowliness of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>, is even more hateful and contemptible than open self-assertion.<p><span class= "bld">As this little child.</span>—That which was to be the result of a deliberate act in the disciples was found in the child’s nature as it was. They were to make themselves lowly as he was lowly. The transition from the plural to the singular gives an almost dramatic vividness to the form of our Lord’s teaching. We seem to see the child shrinking timidly, with blushing face and downcast eyes, from the notice thus drawn to him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The greatest ... - That is, shall be the most eminent Christian shall have most of the true spirit of religion.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Mt 18:1-9.

Here was a very fair opportunity for him, if he had pleased, so to have declared his will; but here is not a word of such tendency. Mark saith our Saviour, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. <span class="ital">Sat down, </span> as the manner of their teachers was, when they taught, to denote their authority. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. He <span class="ital">called the twelve, </span> to let them know that what he was about to speak was a grave matter not of a particular but universal concern for them to learn, that, they might teach others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He <span class="ital">said unto them, </span>( saith Mark), <span class="ital">If any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all, and servant of all; and</span> (which Luke adds) <span class="ital">he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</span> You would know (saith he) who shall be greatest he that doth not desire to be first; he who is most remote from pride and ambition; he that most contemneth the world, and the priorities and superiorities of it. The proud and ambitious man, he that seeketh great things for himself, shall be of least esteem in my kingdom; he is really least in grace, and ought to be of least esteem and repute among Christians, and he will be the last in the kingdom of glory. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then he calleth to him <span class="ital">a little child:</span> the word doth not always signify a very young child; here it doth, for, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. He took him in his arms (saith Mark). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. A young child was the fittest pattern to commend humility to them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This was an ancient and usual way of teaching, by types, as it were, or patterns: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-10.htm" title="Then shall you break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with you,">Jeremiah 19:10</a> 27:2</span>. He reads this lecture upon the child, <span class="ital">Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, &c.</span> The prefixing <span class="ital">Verily</span> adds much to the authority of this saying. Converted here, stra-fhte, doth not signify the change or conversion of a soul from a state of sin unto God, (so the apostles were already converted), but the turning of their souls from a particular lust or error, into the opposite right way of truth and holiness: except ye repent of your pride and ambition, ye cannot be saved. The next words expound it, <span class="ital">and become as little children:</span> not as little children in all things, (which was the Anabaptists’ dream in Germany, upon which they would run about the streets playing with rattles, &c.), but, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-4.htm" title="Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 18:4</a></span>, humbling yourselves as little children. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Little children know not what dominion means, and therefore affect it not, are not ambitious. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. They are not given to boast and glory, and to prefer themselves before others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. They are ready to be taught and instructed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. They live upon their fathers’ providence, and are not over solicitous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. They are not malicious and vindictive. <span class="ital">In malice</span> (saith the apostle) <span class="ital">be ye children.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The three first are principally here intended. If ye be not thus like little children, ye will be so far from being greatest in the kingdom of God, that you will never come here at all. So as this text teacheth us all, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. The necessity of humility in order to salvation. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That even converted souls have need of a daily conversion. Repentance is a work which will never be perfected till we come to die. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. How abominable in the eyes of God ambition and pride are in any, especially in ministers of the gospel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That in the church the way to be great is to be humble. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. That true humility lieth in a mean opinion of ourselves, not minding high things, condescending to men of low estate, not being wise in our own conceits, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-16.htm" title="Be of the same mind one toward another.

If your entering the future Messianic kingdom at all is determined by your returning again to a child-like frame of mind, then above all must you acquire, through humble self-abasement, the <span class="ital">unassuming</span> character of this child, in order to be <span class="ital">greater</span> than others in the Messiah’s kingdom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅστις</span>] <span class="ital">quicunque;</span> “de <span class="ital">individuo</span>, de quo quaerebant, non respondet,” Bengel.

But this is a joint work. St. Gregory says well, "The good which a man doeth is both the work of God and the work of man: of God, as being the Author, in giving grace; of man, as being actor, in using grace, yet so that he cooperate with grace by grace" (quoted by Ford, <span class="accented">in loc</span>.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/18.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>As this little child<p>Not, as this little child humbles himself, but, shall make himself humble as this little child is lowly; shall willingly become by spiritual process what the child is by nature. </body></html>
