Our Lord appeals as by anticipation to the judgment which Christians in general, perhaps even to that which mankind at large, would pass upon such conduct. It is suggestive that He describes them, not as being angry or indignant (though such feelings would have been natural enough), but as “exceeding sorry.” Sorrow, rather than anger, is the mood of the true disciple of Christ as he witnesses the sins against love which are the scandals of the Christian society. Anger, the righteous wrath against evil, belongs rather, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-32.htm" title="Then his lord, after that he had called him, said to him, O you wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt, because you desired me:">Matthew 18:32</a>, to the Lord and Judge.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-31.htm" title="So when his fellow servants saw what was done, they were very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done....">Matthew 18:31-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">When his fellow-servants saw what was done </span>— When they beheld such inhumanity, in such circumstances, and from such a man; <span class="ital">they were very sorry </span>— Exceedingly grieved at such an instance of unexampled cruelty from a man who had himself experienced such mercy; <span class="ital">and came and told their lord </span>— Gave their lord the king an exact and faithful account of the whole matter. <span class="ital">Then his lord said, O thou wicked servant </span>— Hard-hearted and unmerciful; <span class="ital">I forgave thee all that debt </span>— The vast sums due to me; <span class="ital">because thou desiredst me </span>— Didst acknowledge the debt, fell down at my feet, and humbly begged me to have patience with thee; <span class="ital">shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy fellow-servant </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Who in like manner acknowledged his debt, and promised payment, showing thee, in his supplication, though thine equal, as much respect as thou showedst to me, thy lord and king? <span class="ital">And his lord was wroth </span>— Was exceedingly enraged; <span class="ital">and delivered him to the tormentors </span>— Not only revoked the grant of remission which he had just before made, as forfeited by so vile a behaviour; but put him in prison, commanding him to be there fettered and scourged; <span class="ital">till he should pay all that was due unto him — </span>That is, without any hope of release, for the immense debt which he owed he could never be able to pay. Instead of <span class="ital">tormentors, </span>here, Dr. Campbell reads <span class="ital">jailers, </span>observing that “the word <span class="greekheb">βασανιστης</span>, here used, properly denotes <span class="ital">examiner, </span>particularly one who has it in charge to examine by torture. Hence it came to signify <span class="ital">jailer, </span>for on such, in those days, was this charge commonly devolved. They were not only allowed, but even commanded, to treat the wretches in their custody with every kind of cruelty, in order to extort payment from them, in case they had concealed any of their effects; or, if they had nothing, to wrest the sum owed from the compassion of their relations and friends, who, to release an unhappy person for whom they had a regard from such extreme misery, might be induced to pay the debt; for the person of the insolvent debtor was absolutely in the power of the creditor, and at his disposal.” But it must be observed that imprisonment is a much severer punishment in the eastern countries than in ours. State criminals especially, when condemned to it, are not only confined to a very mean and scanty allowance, but are frequently loaded with clogs or heavy yokes, so that they can neither lie nor sit at ease; and by frequent scourgings, and sometimes rackings, are brought to an untimely end. How observable is this whole account; as well as the great inference our Lord draws from it! 1, The debtor was freely and fully forgiven; 2, He wilfully and grievously offended; 3, His pardon was retracted, the whole debt required, and the offender delivered to the tormentors for ever. And shall we still say, that when <span class="ital">we </span>are once freely and fully forgiven, <span class="ital">our </span>pardon can never be retracted? Verily, verily I say unto you, <span class="ital">So likewise will my heavenly Father do to </span>you, <span class="ital">if ye from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:21-35 Though we live wholly on mercy and forgiveness, we are backward to forgive the offences of our brethren. This parable shows how much provocation God has from his family on earth, and how untoward his servants are. There are three things in the parable: 1. The master's wonderful clemency. The debt of sin is so great, that we are not able to pay it. See here what every sin deserves; this is the wages of sin, to be sold as a slave. It is the folly of many who are under strong convictions of their sins, to fancy they can make God satisfaction for the wrong they have done him. 2. The servant's unreasonable severity toward his fellow-servant, notwithstanding his lord's clemency toward him. Not that we may make light of wronging our neighbour, for that is also a sin against God; but we should not aggravate our neighbour's wronging us, nor study revenge. Let our complaints, both of the wickedness of the wicked, and of the afflictions of the afflicted, be brought to God, and left with him. 3. The master reproved his servant's cruelty. The greatness of sin magnifies the riches of pardoning mercy; and the comfortable sense of pardoning mercy, does much to dispose our hearts to forgive our brethren. We are not to suppose that God actually forgives men, and afterwards reckons their guilt to them to condemn them; but this latter part of the parable shows the false conclusions many draw as to their sins being pardoned, though their after-conduct shows that they never entered into the spirit, or experienced the sanctifying grace of the gospel. We do not forgive our offending brother aright, if we do not forgive from the heart. Yet this is not enough; we must seek the welfare even of those who offend us. How justly will those be condemned, who, though they bear the Christian name, persist in unmerciful treatment of their brethren! The humbled sinner relies only on free, abounding mercy, through the ransom of the death of Christ. Let us seek more and more for the renewing grace of God, to teach us to forgive others as we hope for forgiveness from him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So when his fellow-servants ... - This is a mere circumstance thrown into the story for the sake of keeping, or making a consistent narrative. It cannot be intended to teach that other Christians should go and tell God what a brother has done; for God well knows all the actions of his children, and does not need us surely to inform him of what is done. It is abusing the Bible, and departing from the design of parables, to press every circumstance, and to endeavor to extract from it some spiritual meaning. Our Saviour, in this parable, designed most clearly to exhibit only one great truth - the duty of forgiving our brethren, and the great evil of not forgiving a brother when he offends us. The circumstances of the parable are intended only to make the story consistent with itself, and thus to impress the general truth more fully on the mind. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30.
