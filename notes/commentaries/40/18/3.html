What was needed was that they should “turn” from their self-seeking ambition, and regain, in this respect, the relative blamelessness of children.<p><span class= "bld">Ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</span>—The force of the words as spoken to the Twelve can hardly be exaggerated. They were disputing about precedence in the kingdom, and in that very dispute they were showing that they were not truly in it. It was essentially spiritual, and its first condition was abnegation of self. Even the chief of the Apostles was self-excluded when he gloried in his primacy. The words at least help us to understand the more mysterious language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-3.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.">John 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5</a>, as to the “new birth” of water and the Spirit, which one, at least, of the disputants must, in all likelihood, have heard.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/18-3.htm" title="And said, Truly I say to you, Except you be converted, and become as little children, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 18:3-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">And said, Verily I say unto you </span>— What I say is an undoubted and most important truth, a truth which you ought not only firmly to believe but seriously to lay to heart: <span class="ital">except ye be converted — </span>Turned from these worldly and carnal views and desires; <span class="ital">and become like little children</span> — “Free from pride, covetousness, and ambition, and resemble them in humility, sincerity, docility, and disengagement of affection from the things of the present life, which excite the ambition of grown men,” ye shall be so far from becoming <span class="ital">the greatest </span>in my kingdom, that ye shall not so much as enter into it. Observe well, reader, the first step toward entering into the kingdom of grace is to <span class="ital">become as little children: </span>lowly in heart, knowing ourselves utterly ignorant and helpless, and hanging wholly on our Father who is in heaven, for a supply of all our wants. We may further assert, (though it is doubtful whether this text implies so much,) except we be turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God: except we be entirely, inwardly changed, and renewed in the image of God, we cannot enter into the kingdom of glory. Thus must every man be converted in this life, or he can never enter into life eternal. <span class="ital">Whosoever therefore shall humble himself </span>— He that has the greatest measure of humility, joined with the sister graces of resignation, patience, meekness, gentleness, and long-suffering, shall be the greatest in Christ’s kingdom: whosoever rests satisfied with the place, station, and office which God assigns him, whatever it may be, and meekly receives all the divine instructions, and complies with them, though contrary to his own inclinations, and prefers others in honour to himself, — such a person is really great in the kingdom of heaven, or of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-6 Christ spoke many words of his sufferings, but only one of his glory; yet the disciples fasten upon that, and overlook the others. Many love to hear and speak of privileges and glory, who are willing to pass by the thoughts of work and trouble. Our Lord set a little child before them, solemnly assuring them, that unless they were converted and made like little children, they could not enter his kingdom. Children, when very young, do not desire authority, do not regard outward distinctions, are free from malice, are teachable, and willingly dependent on their parents. It is true that they soon begin to show other dispositions, and other ideas are taught them at an early age; but these are marks of childhood, and render them proper emblems of the lowly minds of true Christians. Surely we need to be daily renewed in the spirit of our minds, that we may become simple and humble, as little children, and willing to be the least of all. Let us daily study this subject, and examine our own spirits.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Except ye be converted - The word "converted" means changed or turned.<p>The verb means to change or turn from one habit of life or set of opinions to another, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-19.htm">James 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-32.htm">Luke 22:32</a>.

It sometimes refers to that great change called the new birth or regeneration <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-13.htm">Psalm 51:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-5.htm">Isaiah 60:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>, but not always. It is a general word, meaning any change. The word "regeneration" denotes a particular change the beginning to live a spiritual life. The phrase, "Except ye be converted," does not imply, of necessity, that they were not Christians before, or had not been born again. It means that their opinions and feelings about the kingdom of the Messiah must be changed. They had supposed that he was to be a temporal prince. They expected he would reign as other kings did. They supposed he would have his great officers of state, as other monarchs had, and they were ambitiously inquiring who should hold the highest offices. Jesus told them that they were wrong in their views and expectations. No such things would take place. From these notions they must be turned, changed or converted, or they could have no part in his kingdom. These ideas did not fit at all the nature of his kingdom.<p>And become as little children - Children are, to a great extent, destitute of ambition, pride, and haughtiness They are characteristically humble and teachable. By requiring his disciples to be like them, he did not intend to express any opinion about the native moral character of children, but simply that in these respects they must become like them. They must lay aside their ambitious views and their pride, and be willing to occupy their proper station - a very lowly one. Mark says <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-35.htm">Mark 9:35</a> that Jesus, before he placed the little child in the midst of them, told them that "if any man desire to be first, the same shall be last of all and servant of all." That is, he shall be the most distinguished Christian who is the most humble, and who is willing to be esteemed least and last of all. To esteem ourselves as God esteems us is humility, and it cannot be degrading to think of ourselves as we are; but pride, or an attempt to be thought of more importance than we are, is foolish, wicked, and degrading.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 18<p>Mt 18:1-9.

How many who pass for converted, regenerate persons have need to be converted over again, more radically! Chrys. remarks: “We are not able to reach even the faults of the Twelve; we ask not who is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven, but who is the greater in the Kingdom of Earth: the richer the more powerful” (Hom. lviii.). The remark is not true to the spirit of Christ. In His eyes vanity and ambition in the sphere of religion were graver offences than the sins of the worldly. His tone at this time is markedly severe, as much so as when He denounced the vices of the Pharisees. It was indeed Pharisaism in the bud He had to deal with. Resch suggests that <span class="greekheb">στραφῆτε</span> here simply represents the idea of becoming <span class="ital">again</span> children, corresponding to the Hebrew idiom which uses <span class="greekheb">שׁוּב</span> = <span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span> (<span class="ital">Aussercanonische Paralleltexte zu Mt. and Mk.</span>, p. 213).—<span class="greekheb">ὡς τὰ παιδία</span>, like the children, in unpretentiousness.

There is no question here about what is popularly known as conversion - the change from habitual sin to holiness. The conversion here spoken of is confined to a change in the present state of mind - to a new direction given to the thoughts and wishes. The apostles had shown rivalry, jealousy, ambition: they must turn away from such failings, and learn a different lesson. <span class="cmt_word">Become as little children.</span> Christ points to little children as the model to which the members of his kingdom must assimilate themselves. The special attributes of children which he would recommend are humility, unworldliness, simplicity, teachableness, - the direct contraries of self-seeking, worldliness, distrust, conceit. <span class="cmt_word">Ye shall not enter.</span> In the sermon on the mount Christ had said, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm">Matthew 5:3</a>). To all who are not such the gate opens not. That virtue which was unknown to pagan antiquity, the opposite character to which was upholden as the acme of excellence, Christ here asserts to be the only passport to his ideal Church on earth or its eternal development in heaven. Not the self-esteeming, proud man (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>) of Aristotle's worship ('Eth.
