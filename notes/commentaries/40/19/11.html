What follows, however, determines the reference to the latter. Looking at marriage from a simply selfish point of view, and therefore with an entirely inadequate estimate of its duties on the one hand, and on the other of the temptations incident to the unmarried life when chosen on such grounds, they had come rashly to the conclusion that, if our Lord’s rule held good, it was not good, not expedient, to “marry.” He declares that judgment to be false. There were but few who were capable of acting safely on that conclusion. For those who were not so capable, and the next verse tells us who they were, marriage, with all its risks, was the truer, healthier, safer state. Alike in its brighter or sadder sides, in seeming success or seeming failure, it brought to men the discipline they needed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:3-12 The Pharisees were desirous of drawing something from Jesus which they might represent as contrary to the law of Moses. Cases about marriage have been numerous, and sometimes perplexed; made so, not by the law of God, but by the lusts and follies of men; and often people fix what they will do, before they ask for advice. Jesus replied by asking whether they had not read the account of the creation, and the first example of marriage; thus pointing out that every departure therefrom was wrong. That condition is best for us, and to be chosen and kept to accordingly, which is best for our souls, and tends most to prepare us for, and preserve us to, the kingdom of heaven. When the gospel is really embraced, it makes men kind relatives and faithful friends; it teaches them to bear the burdens, and to bear with the infirmities of those with whom they are connected, to consider their peace and happiness more than their own. As to ungodly persons, it is proper that they should be restrained by laws, from breaking the peace of society. And we learn that the married state should be entered upon with great seriousness and earnest prayer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All men cannot receive this saying - The minds of people are not prepared for this. This saying evidently means what the disciples had just said that it was good for a man not to marry. It might be good in certain circumstances - in times of persecution and trial, or for the sake of laboring in the cause of religion without the care and burden of a family. It might be good for many to live, as some of the apostles did, without marriage, but it was not given to all people, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm">1 Corinthians 7:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-7.htm">1 Corinthians 7:7</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-9.htm">1 Corinthians 7:9</a>.

The disciples have just said: <span class="greekheb">οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι</span>. But <span class="ital">to this saying</span> must <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον τοῦτον</span> be referred, not to the <span class="ital">statement concerning the indissoluble nature of marriage</span>, as though Jesus meant to say that this was to be insisted on only in the case of those who had been endowed with the <span class="ital">donum continentiae</span> (Hofmann, <span class="ital">Schriftbew</span>. II. 2, p. 410 f.); which would be to contradict His argument in favour of non-dissolution taken from the objective <span class="ital">nature</span> of marriage, no less than His absolute declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>, as well as to render nugatory, for all practical purposes, the primitive moral law of non-dissolution, by making it dependent on a subjective condition. Besides, the illustration of the <span class="ital">eunuchs</span> is only applicable to <span class="ital">continence generally</span>, not to a mere abstaining from the sin of <span class="ital">adultery</span>. No. Jesus wishes to furnish His disciples with the necessary explanation regarding their <span class="greekheb">οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι</span>, and for this end He by no means questions their <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, but simply observes that: <span class="ital">it is a proposition which all do not accept, i.e</span>. which all cannot see their way to adopt as a maxim, <span class="ital">but only such as God has endowed with special moral capabilities</span>. Then, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>, He explains who are meant by the <span class="greekheb">οἷς δέδοται</span>, namely, such as have become <span class="ital">eunuchs</span>; by these, however, He does not understand <span class="ital">literal</span> eunuchs, whether born such or made such by men, but those who, for the sake of the Messiah’s kingdom, have made themselves such so far as their moral dispositions are concerned, <span class="ital">i.e</span>. who have suppressed all sexual desire as effectually as though they were actual eunuchs, in order that they might devote themselves entirely to the (approaching) Messianic kingdom as their highest interest and aim (to labour in promoting it, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-32.htm" title="But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:">1 Corinthians 7:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm" title="There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married cares for the things of the world, how she may please her husband.">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>). Finally, He further <span class="ital">recommends</span> this ethical self-castration, this “voluntary chastity” (Luther), when He exclaims: <span class="ital">Whosoever is able to accept</span> (to adopt) <span class="ital">it</span> (that which I have just stated), <span class="ital">let him accept it!</span> Chrysostom well observes: He says this, <span class="greekheb">προθυμοτέρους τε ποιῶν τῷ δεῖξαι ὑπέρογκον ὂν τὸ κατόρθωμα</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἀφιεῖς εἰς ἀνάγκην νόμου τὸ πρᾶγμα κλεισθῆναι</span>. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-1.htm" title="Now concerning the things whereof you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.">1 Corinthians 7:1</a> f. The <span class="greekheb">χερεῖν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-11.htm" title="But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.">Matthew 19:11</a> f., means simply to <span class="ital">receive</span>, and to be understood as referring to a <span class="ital">spiritual</span> reception, a receiving in the heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-2.htm" title="Receive us; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have defrauded no man.">2 Corinthians 7:2</a>); and those endowed with the power so to receive it have, in consequence of such endowment, not only the inclination to be continent, but at the same time the moral force of will necessary to give effect to it, while those who are not so endowed “aut nolunt, aut non implent quod volunt,” Augustine. The <span class="ital">more common</span> interpretation, <span class="ital">praestare posse</span> (“negat autem Jesus, te, nisi divinitus concessis viribus tam insigni abstinentiae, qua a matrimonio abhorreas, parem esse,” Fritzsche), might be traced to the rendering <span class="ital">capere</span>, but it is precluded by the fact that the object of the verb is a <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> (<span class="ital">a saying</span>). <span class="ital">Others</span> take it in the sense of: <span class="ital">to understand</span>, with reference, therefore, to the power of apprehension on the part of the <span class="ital">intellect</span> (Maldonatus, Calovius, Strauss, Bretschneider, Baumgarten-Crusius, Ewald; similarly Bengel, de Wette, Bleek, who, however, arbitrarily take <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τοῦτ</span>. as pointing forward to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>). So Plut. <span class="ital">Cat. min.</span> 64; Ael. <span class="ital">V. H</span>. iii. 9; Phocyl. 86: <span class="greekheb">οὐ χωρεῖ μεγάλην διδαχὴν ἀδίδακτος</span>; Philo, <span class="ital">de mundo</span> Matthew 1151: <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρώπινος λογισμὸς οὐ χωρεῖ</span>. But the difficulty with respect to what the disciples have said, and what Jesus says in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-12.htm" title="For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive it, let him receive it.">Matthew 19:12</a>, is not connected with the apprehension of its meaning, but with its ethical appropriation, which, moreover, Jesus does not absolutely <span class="ital">demand</span>, but leaves it, as is also done by Paul, 1 Corinthians 7., to each man’s <span class="ital">ability</span>, and that according as he happens to be endowed with the gift of continence as a <span class="ital">donum singulare</span>. Consequently, the celibate of the clerical <span class="ital">order</span>, as such, acts in direct opposition to this utterance of the Master, especially as the <span class="greekheb">εὐνουχίζειν ἑαυτόν</span> cannot be acted on by any one with the certainty of its <span class="ital">lasting</span>. Comp. <span class="ital">Apol. Conf. A</span>., p. 240 f.: “non placet Christo <span class="ital">immunda continentia</span>.” As showing how voluntary celibacy was by no means universal, and was exceptional even among the apostles themselves, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-5.htm" title="Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles, and as the brothers of the Lord, and Cephas?">1 Corinthians 9:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The metaphorical use of <span class="greekheb">εὐνούχισαν ἑαυτούς</span> to denote entire absence from sexual indulgence, likewise occurs in <span class="ital">Sohar Ex</span>. f. 37, c. 135; <span class="ital">Levit</span>. f. 34, c. 136 b; Schoettgen, p. 159.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is well known that from a misunderstanding of the meaning of this passage Origen was led to castrate himself. On the correctness of this tradition (in answer to Schnitzer and Bauer), see Engelhardt in the <span class="ital">Stud. u.

The celibacy which a certain class of Essenes observed was founded on the fact that they regarded marriage as <span class="ital">impure</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/19.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-11.htm" title="But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.">Matthew 19:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὁ δὲ εἶπεν</span>. Jesus catches up the remark of the disciples, and attaches to it a deeper sense than they thought of. Their idea was that marriage was not worth having if a man must put up with all the faults and caprices of a woman, without possibility of escape, except by gross misconduct. He thinks of the celibate state as in certain cases desirable or preferable, irrespective of the drawbacks of married life, and taking it even at the best.—<span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον</span> thus will mean: what you have said, the suggestion that the unmarried condition is preferable.—<span class="greekheb">χωροῦσι</span> = <span class="ital">capere</span>, receive, intellectually and morally, for in such a case the two are inseparable. No man can understand as a matter of theory the preferableness of celibacy under certain circumstances, unless he be capable morally of appreciating the <span class="ital">force</span> of the circumstances.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οἶς δέδοται</span>: this phrase points chiefly to the moral capacity. It is not a question of intelligence, nor of a merely natural power of continence, but of attaining to such a spiritual state that the reasons for remaining free from married ties shall prevail over all forces urging on to marriage. Jesus lifts the whole subject up out of the low region of mere personal taste, pleasure, or convenience, into the high region of the Kingdom of God and its claims.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">this saying</span>] viz. that it is not good to marry.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/19.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-11.htm" title="But he said to them, All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given.">Matthew 19:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ δὲ εἶπεν αὐτοῖς</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">But He said unto them</span>, etc.) To that universal, but less well-founded reason for not contracting matrimony, grounded on the inconvenience which the disciples inferred must arise from its indissolubility, our Lord opposes the legitimate, particular, and only good reason, viz. the being an eunuch,—<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the being exempted by any exceptional cause from the universal law of contracting matrimony.—<span class="greekheb">οὐ πάντες</span>, <span class="ital">not all</span>) Our Lord opposes these words to the universal proposition of His disciples (sc. <span class="greekheb">οὐ συμφέρει γαμῆσαι</span>, <span class="ital">i.e. it is not expedient to marry</span>), and they are equivalent to “<span class="ital">none</span>.”—Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-9.htm" title="What then? are we better than they?
