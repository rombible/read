There is One that is the Good.” The alteration was probably made, as before, for the sake of agreement with the other Gospels. In either case the answer has the same force. The questioner had lightly applied the word “good” to One whom he as yet regarded only as a human teacher, to an act which, it seemed to him, was in his own power to perform. What he needed, therefore, was to be taught to deepen and widen his thoughts of goodness until they rose to Him in whom alone it was absolute and infinite, through fellowship with whom only could any teacher rightly be called good, and from whom alone could come the power to do any good thing. The method by which our Lord leads him to that conclusion may, without irreverence, be permitted to call up the thought of the method in which Socrates is related to have dealt with like questioners, both in the grave, sad irony of the process, and in the self-knowledge in which it was designed to issue.<p><span class= "bld">Keep the commandments.</span>—The questioner is answered as from his own point of view. If eternal life was to be won by doing, there was no need to come to a new Teacher for a new precept. It was enough to keep the commandments, the great moral laws of God, as distinct from ordinances and traditions (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-3.htm" title="But he answered and said to them, Why do you also transgress the commandment of God by your tradition?">Matthew 15:3</a>), with which every Israelite was familiar.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments....">Matthew 19:17-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">He said, Why callest thou me good? </span>— Whom thou regardest merely as a prophet sent from God, and therefore supposest to be only a man; <span class="ital">there is none good </span>— Supremely, originally, essentially, <span class="ital">but God. If thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments </span>— From a principle of loving faith. Believe, and thence love and obey. And this undoubtedly is the way to eternal life. Our Lord therefore does not answer ironically, which had been utterly beneath his character, but gives a plain, direct, serious answer to a serious question. <span class="ital">The young man saith, All these have I kept from my childhood </span>— So he imagined, and perhaps he had, as to the letter, but not as to the spirit, which our Lord immediately shows. <span class="ital">What lack I yet? </span>— Wherein am I deficient? What is further needful in order to my securing the glorious prize which I am pursuing? In answer to this inquiry, made by one evidently puffed up with a high opinion of his own righteousness, our Lord replies, <span class="ital">If thou wilt be perfect </span>— That is, a real, thorough Christian, <span class="ital">yet lackest thou one thing, </span>(Luke,) namely, to be saved from the love of the world; from all undue esteem for, and inordinate affection to, earthly things. Therefore, <span class="ital">go and sell that thou hast, </span>(Luke, <span class="ital">all that thou hast,</span>) <span class="ital">and give </span>— Distribute the money which arises from the sale thereof; <span class="ital">to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven </span>— Infinitely more excellent and durable than that which thou renouncest on earth. <span class="ital">And come, </span>(<span class="ital">take up the cross, </span>Mark,) <span class="ital">and follow me </span>— Unite thyself to me as my constant attendant, though it should be even at the expense of thy life. He who reads the heart, saw that this young man’s bosom sin was the love of his worldly possessions; and that he could not be saved from it but by literally parting with them. To <span class="ital">him, </span>therefore, he gave this particular direction, which he never designed for a general rule to all his followers. For <span class="ital">him </span>this was necessary, not only, as some suppose, in order to his giving proof of exalted piety, but in order to his salvation. For <span class="ital">him </span>literally to sell all, was an absolute duty; for many to do this would be an absolute sin. And yet, though God does not in fact require every man to distribute all his goods to others, and so in effect to become one of the number of the poor relieved out of his own possessions, yet sincere piety and virtue require in all an habitual readiness not only to sacrifice their possessions, but their lives, at the command of God; and Providence has in fact, in all ages, called some out to trials as severe as this. And certainly an entire renunciation of the world, so far at least as to be willing to part with it whenever God should call them to it, was peculiarly necessary for all Christians in the first ages, when the profession of Christianity so generally exposed men to persecution and death. <span class="ital">And when he heard this he went away sorrowful </span>— Not being willing to have salvation at so high a price; <span class="ital">for he had great possessions </span>— Which he now plainly showed he valued more than eternal life: and it was with great wisdom that our Lord took this direct and convincing method of manifesting both to himself and others that secret insincerity and carnality of temper which prevailed under all these specious pretences and promising appearances.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:16-22 Christ knew that covetousness was the sin which most easily beset this young man; though he had got honestly what he possessed, yet he could not cheerfully part with it, and by this his want of sincerity was shown. Christ's promises make his precepts easy, and his yoke pleasant and very comfortable; yet this promise was as much a trial of the young man's faith, as the precept was of his charity and contempt of the world. It is required of us in following Christ, that we duly attend his ordinances, strictly follow his pattern, and cheerfully submit to his disposals; and this from love to him, and in dependence on him. To sell all, and give to the poor, will not serve, but we are to follow Christ. The gospel is the only remedy for lost sinners. Many abstain from gross vices who do not attend to their obligations to God. Thousands of instances of disobedience in thought, word, and deed, are marked against them in the book of God. Thus numbers forsake Christ, loving this present world: they feel convictions and desires, but they depart sorrowful, perhaps trembling. It behoves us to try ourselves in these matters, for the Lord will try us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why callest thou me good? - Why do you give to me a title that belongs only to God? You suppose me to be only a man, yet you give me an appellation that belongs only to God.<p>It is improper to use titles in this manner. As you Jews use them they are unmeaning; and though the title may apply to me, yet, you did not intend to use it in the sense in which it is proper, as denoting infinite perfection or divinity; but you intended to use it as a complimentary or a flattering title, applied to me as if I were a mere man - a title which belongs only to God. The intentions, the habit of using mere titles, and applying as a compliment terms belonging only to God, is wrong. Christ did not intend here to disclaim divinity, or to say anything about his own character, but simply to reprove the intention and habit of the young man - a most severe reproof of a foolish habit of compliment and flattery, and seeking pompous titles.<p>Keep the commandments - That is, do what God has commanded. He in the next verses informs him what he meant by the commandments. Jesus said this, doubtless, to try him, and to convince him that he had by no means kept the commandments, and that in supposing he had he was altogether deceived. The young man thought he had kept them, and was relying on them for salvation. It was of great importance, therefore, to convince him that he was, after all, a sinner. Christ did not mean to say that any man would be saved by the works of the law, for the Bible teaches plainly that such will not be the case, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm">Romans 3:20</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-28.htm">Romans 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-6.htm">Romans 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-9.htm">Ephesians 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>. At the same time, however, it is true that if a man perfectly complied with the requirements of the law he would be saved, for there would be no reason why he should be condemned. Jesus, therefore, since he saw he was depending on his works, told him that if he would enter into life that is, into heaven - he must keep the commandments; if he was depending on them he must keep them perfectly, and if this was done he would be saved. The reasons why Christ gave him this direction were, probably:<p>1. because it was his duty to keep them.<p>2. because the young man depended on them, and he ought to understand what was required if he did - that they should be kept perfectly, or that they were not kept at all.<p>3. because he wanted to test him, to show him that he did not keep them, and thus to show him his need of a Saviour.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 19:16-30.

Our Saviour’s design here was, not to show this young man by this answer the way by which it was possible that he or any other might come to heaven, but only to convince him of the errors of the Pharisaical doctrine. They would not own Christ to be God, nor to be come forth from God; they taught eternal life to be obtainable by the works of the law, and by a fulfilling of the law, according to that imperfect sense which they gave of it, of which we heard much, in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-1.htm" title="And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was set, his disciples came to him:...">Matthew 5:1-48</a></span>.

Therefore <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">keep the commandments.</span> Not that our Saviour thought he could do it, or that there did lie a passable road to heaven that way, but that he might convince him of his error, and the need he had of a Saviour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto him,.... By way of reply, first taking notice of, and questioning him about, the epithet he gave him: <p>why callest thou me good? not that he denied that he was so; for he was good, both as God and man, in his divine and human natures; in all his offices, and the execution of them; he was goodness itself, and did good, and nothing else but good. But the reason of the question is, because this young man considered him only as a mere man, and gave him this character as such; and which, in comparison of God, the fountain of all goodness, agrees with no mere man: wherefore our Lord's view is, by his own language; and from his own words, to instruct him in the knowledge of his proper deity. Some copies read, "why dost thou ask me concerning good". And so the Vulgate Latin, and the Ethiopic versions, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel read; but the Syriac, Arabic, and Persic versions, read as we do, and this the answer of Christ requires. <p>There is none good but one, that is God; who is originally, essentially, independently, infinitely, and immutably good, and the author and source of all goodness; which cannot be said of any mere creature. This is to be understood of God considered essentially, and not personally; or it is to be understood, not of the person of the Father, to the exclusion of the Son, or Spirit: who are one God with the Father, and equally good in nature as he. Nor does this contradict and deny that there are good angels, who have continued in that goodness in which they were created; or that there are good men, made so by the grace of God; but that none are absolutely and perfectly good, but God. What Christ here says of God, the (b) Jews say of the law of Moses, whose praise they can never enough extol;    "there is nothing good but the law". The law is good indeed; but the author of it must be allowed to be infinitely more so. Christ next directly answers to the question, <p>but if thou wilt enter into life: eternal life, which is in the question, and which being sometimes expressed by a house, a city, and kingdom, by mansions, and everlasting habitations, enjoyment of it is fitly signified by entering into it; which, if our Lord suggests, he had a desire of having a right to by doing any good thing himself, he must <p>keep the commandments; that is, perfectly: he must do not only one good thing, but all the good things the law requires; he must not be deficient in any single action, in anyone work of the law, either as to matter, or manner of performance; everything must be done, and that just as the Lord in his law has commanded it. Our Lord answers according to the tenor of the covenant of works, under which this man was; and according to the law of God, which requires perfect obedience to it, as a righteousness, and a title to life; and in case of the least failure, curses and condemns to everlasting death; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-25.htm">Deuteronomy 6:25</a>. This Christ said, in order to show, that it is impossible to enter into, or obtain eternal life by the works of the law, since no man can perfectly keep it; and to unhinge this man from off the legal foundation on which he was, that he might drop all his dependencies on doing good things, and come to him for righteousness and life. <p>(b) T.

Our Lord takes the ruler to task for applying this epithet to him. unless the youth believed in his Divinity. You think of me only as a learned Teacher: how, then, can you speak of me in a term which can really be predicated of no child of man? Christ answers the ruler's address before he touches the subject of his interrogation, reproving him for using a form of words without realizing its full import. This is all plain enough; but many good manuscripts, including <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> B, D, etc., Vulgate, and other versions, read, <span class="accented">Why askest thou me concerning the good?</span> Most modern editors and the Revised Version have adopted this reading, which they hold to be genuine, and to have been altered subsequently in order to conform it to the other synoptists. If this is so, it is difficult to see whence Mark and Luke obtained their wording, unless - which is improbable - our Lord used both interrogations on the same occasion. The revised reading expresses Christ's astonishment at having this question asked; and it may be taken, as Bengel suggests, "He who is good ought to be interrogated about the good;" or, "What is right to do, you ought to know; it can only be obedience to the Author of all goodness." There is <span class="cmt_word">none good but one</span>, that is, <span class="cmt_word">God</span>. Here again the reading varies.

Late editors, following <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, B, D, etc., have printed, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f76;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>: <span class="accented">one there is who is good</span>, or <span class="accented">one is the good</span>. God alone is the absolutely good; he alone can instruct you and put you certainly in the right way. Persons have been found to argue from this sentence that Christ renounces all claim to be God Almighty. But it is not so. He replies to what was in the young man's mind. The ruler regarded Jesus as man only; Jesus intimates that, in comparison with God, no man is good. He does not deny the applicability of the epithet to himself, but turns the questioner's thoughts to the Source of all good. He will not have himself regarded simply as a pre-eminently good man, but as Son of God, one with the Father. <span class="cmt_word">If thou wilt</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">willest to</span>) enter into life; <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. enjoy eternal life. Christ uses a term equivalent to that of the ruler in ver. 16. So Christ said on another occasion to a lawyer who tempted him. "This do, and thou shalt live" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-28.htm">Luke 10:28</a>). There is no real life without obedience. <span class="cmt_word">Keep the commandments</span> of him who is good. The Law was given to prepare men to receive Christianity, and in proportion as they carefully observed it, so were they made ready to inherit the life which Christ gives. No mere external compliance without faith is here approved, but it is laid down that, in order to win eternal life, there must be strict observance of God's laws - not some one extraordinary performance, but constant attention to known duties from the highest motive. Faith, indeed, is belief in action, and is dead and profitless if inoperative; so that true obedience is the outcome of true faith. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/19.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Why callest thou me good?

The saying of Christ appears especially appropriate in the light of the Rabbinic apothegm, "There is nothing else that is good but the law." </body></html>
