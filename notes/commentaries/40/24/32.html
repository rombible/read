Both time and place make this probable. It was on the Mount of Olives, where then, as now, fig trees were found as well as olives (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-19.htm" title="And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward for ever. And presently the fig tree withered away.">Matthew 21:19</a>), and the season was that of early spring, when “the flowers appear on the earth” and the “fig tree putteth forth her green figs” (Song <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/songs/2-11.htm" title="For, see, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;">Song of Solomon 2:11-13</a>). And what our Lord teaches is that as surely as the fresh green foliage of the fig tree is a sign of summer, so shall the signs of which He speaks portend the coming of the Son of Man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:...">Matthew 24:32-35</a></span>. <span class="ital">Now learn a parable of the fig-tree </span>— Our Lord proceeds to declare that the signs which he had given would be as certain an indication of the time of his coming, as the fig-tree’s putting forth its leaves is of the approach of summer; and that the time of his coming was at no great distance. For he adds, <span class="ital">This generation shall not pass till all these things be fulfilled, — </span>Hereby evidently showing that he had been speaking all this while only of the calamities coming on the Jews, and the destruction of Jerusalem. “It is to me a wonder,” says Bishop Newton, “how any man can refer part of the foregoing discourse to the destruction of Jerusalem, and part to the end of the world, or any other distant event, when it is said so positively here in the conclusion, <span class="ital">All these things shall be fulfilled in this generation. </span>And it seems as if our Lord had been aware of some such misapplication of his words, by adding yet greater force and emphasis to his affirmation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-35.htm" title="Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.">Matthew 24:35</a>, <span class="ital">Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away </span>— That is, heaven and earth shall sooner, or more easily pass away than my words; the frame of the universe shall sooner, or more easily pass away than my words shall not be fulfilled. In another place, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-28.htm" title="Truly I say to you, There be some standing here, which shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming in his kingdom.">Matthew 16:28</a>,) he says, <span class="ital">There are some standing here which shall not taste of death till they see, the Son of man coming in his kingdom, </span>intimating that the event would not take place immediately, and yet not at such a distance of time but that some then living would be spectators of the calamities coming upon the nation. In like manner, he says to the women who bewailed him as he was going to be crucified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-28.htm" title="But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.">Luke 23:28</a>, <span class="ital">Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children; </span>which words sufficiently implied that the days of distress and misery were coming, and would fall on them and their children. But at that time there was not any appearance of such an immediate ruin. The wisest politician could not have inferred any such thing from the then present state of affairs. Nothing less than divine prescience could have foreseen and foretold it.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:29-41 Christ foretells his second coming. It is usual for prophets to speak of things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness and certainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretold that there shall be a great change, in order to the making all things new. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At his first coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shall shortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they have pierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endless horror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there are some in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shall keep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should never cease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predicting were fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment; therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease to exist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men of the world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but they plan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and most certain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away every human scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will be as surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first, to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment. Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. They were secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and they believed not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortly pass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it far from them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of our Saviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, and suddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their house employments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside, and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I prepared to meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day of judgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now learn a parable - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>.

Cheering prospect for the disciples in the midst of those final convulsions—a prospect depicted by means of a pleasing scene taken from nature. The understanding of this passage depends on the correct interpretation (1) of <span class="greekheb">τὸ θέρος</span>, (2) of <span class="greekheb">πάντα ταῦτα</span>, and also (3) on our taking care not to supply anything we choose as the subject of <span class="greekheb">ἐγγύς ἐστιν ἐπὶ θύραις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δέ</span> is simply <span class="greekheb">μεταβατικόν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς συκῆς</span>] the article is <span class="ital">generic</span>; for <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span>, comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm" title="Take my yoke on you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and you shall find rest to your souls.">Matthew 11:29</a>. <span class="ital">From the fig-tree, i.e</span>. in the case of the fig-tree, see the parable (<span class="greekheb">τὴν παρ</span>.) that is intended for your instruction in the circumstances referred to.

Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm" title="And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow;">Matthew 13:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ φύλλα ἐκφύῃ</span>] <span class="ital">and puts forth the leaves</span> (the subject being <span class="greekheb">ὁ κλάδος</span>). Matthaei, Fritzsche, Lachmann, Bleek, on the authority of E F G H K M V <span class="greekheb">Δ</span>, Vulg. It., write <span class="greekheb">ἐκφυῇ</span>, taking it as an aorist, <span class="ital">i.e. et folia edita fuerint</span> (see, in general, Kühner, I. p. 930 f.). But in that case what would be the meaning of the allusion to the branches recovering their sap? Further, it is only by taking <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">φ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκφύῃ</span> as <span class="ital">present</span> that the <span class="ital">strictly definite</span> element is brought out, namely: when the <span class="greekheb">κλάδος</span> <span class="ital">is in the act of budding</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ θέρος</span>] is usually taken in the sense of <span class="ital">aestas</span>, after the Vulgate. But, according to the correct interpretation of <span class="greekheb">πάντα ταῦτα</span>, summer would be <span class="ital">too late</span> in the present instance, and too indefinite; nor would it be sufficiently near to accord with <span class="greekheb">ἐγγύς ἐστιν ἐπὶ θύραις</span>. Hence it is better to understand the <span class="ital">harvest</span> (equivalent to <span class="greekheb">θερισμός</span>, Photius, p. 86, 18) as referred to, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-1.htm" title="As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honor is not seemly for a fool.">Proverbs 26:1</a>; Dem. 1253. 15, and frequently in classical writers; Jacobs, <span class="ital">ad Anthol</span>. VIII. p. 357. Comp. also Ebrard, Keim. It is not, however, the <span class="ital">fig-harvest</span> (which does not occur till August) that is meant, but the <span class="ital">fruit</span>-harvest, the formal commencement of which took place as early as the second day of the Passover season.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οὕτω κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμεῖς</span>] so understand <span class="ital">ye also</span>.

But arbitrary as this is, it is outdone by those who go the length of merely picking out a few from the phenomena in question, in order to restrict the reference of <span class="greekheb">πάντα ταῦτα</span> to them; as, for example, the <span class="ital">incrementa malignitatis</span> (Ebrard), or the <span class="ital">cooling of love</span> among believers, <span class="ital">the preaching to the Gentiles</span>, and the <span class="ital">overthrow of Jerusalem</span> (Gess).

Again, the siege of Jerusalem prefigured by this “parable” took place at the time of harvest (see note, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-21.htm" title="For then shall be great tribulation, such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever shall be.">Matthew 24:21</a></span>).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπὸ δὲ τῆς συκῆς</span>, <span class="ital">but from the fig-tree</span>) An obvious matter.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν</span>, <span class="ital">the</span>) sc. following.—<span class="greekheb">παραβολὴν</span>, <span class="ital">parable</span>) a most beautiful one.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Learn a parable</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">of</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f78;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">the fig tree;</span> bettor, <span class="accented">from the fig tree learns its parable.</span> Learn ye the lesson which this tree can teach you; though, indeed, it might teach other lessons than the one which Christ would enforce. <span class="cmt_word">When his</span> (<span class="accented">its</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>branch is yet tender</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;</span> ... <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f78;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">is now become tender</span>).
