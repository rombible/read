And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? </span>— These seem to be only different expressions to denote the same period with the destruction of Jerusalem, the disciples supposing, that when the destruction of Jerusalem should take place, then would be the coming of Christ and the end of the world, or, <span class="ital">the conclusion of the age, </span>as <span class="greekheb">συντελεια του αιωνος </span>should rather be translated here, and often signifies. See especially Hebrews 9:36; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-11.htm" title="Now all these things happened to them for ensamples: and they are written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the world are come.">1 Corinthians 10:11</a>. Accordingly, in the parallel place of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-4.htm" title="Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled?">Mark 13:4</a>, their question is expressed thus, <span class="ital">When shall these things be, and what shall be the sign when all these things shall be fulfilled? </span>And in that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-7.htm" title="And they asked him, saying, Master, but when shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass?">Luke 21:7</a>, thus, <span class="ital">When shall these things be? and what sign will there be when these things shall come to pass? </span>The disciples therefore inquire concerning two things; 1st, the time of the destruction of Jerusalem; and, 2d, the signs of it. The latter part of the question our Lord answers first, and treats of the signs of his coming from the 4th to the 31st verse, inclusive; and then passes on to the other part of the question, concerning the time of his coming. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, Take heed that no man deceive you </span>— The caution was more particularly designed for the succeeding Christians, whom the apostles then represented. <span class="ital">For many shall come in my name </span>— That is, as Doctor Campbell renders it, <span class="ital">many will assume my character; </span>a reading which expresses our Lord’s meaning more precisely than ours. For to come in any one’s name signifies more properly with us, to come by one’s authority or order, real or pretended; in which sense the Messiah came in the name of God, the apostles came in the name of Christ. But this is far from being the sense of the phrase in this passage; where it plainly signifies that many would usurp his title, make pretensions to his office and character, and thereby lead their followers into the most fatal delusion, <span class="ital">saying, I am Christ </span>— Our Lord begins with this, according to all the evangelists, and they all represent him as using almost the same words: only in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-8.htm" title="And he said, Take heed that you be not deceived: for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and the time draws near: go you not therefore after them.">Luke 21:8</a>, he adds, <span class="ital">the time draweth near; </span>and indeed within a very little time this part of the prophecy began to be fulfilled. Very soon after our Saviour’s decease appeared <span class="ital">Simon Magus, </span>who boasted himself among the Jews as the <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of God, </span>and gave out among the Samaritans, that he was <span class="ital">some great one, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/8-9.htm" title="But there was a certain man, called Simon, which beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:...">Acts 8:9-10</a>. Of the same stamp and character was <span class="ital">Dositheus, </span>the Samaritan, who pretended that he was the Christ foretold by Moses. In the reign of Claudius, about twelve years after the death of our Saviour, when Cuspius Fadus was procurator of Judea, an impostor, named <span class="ital">Theudas, </span>persuaded a great multitude to follow him, with their best effects, to the river Jordan, for he said that he was a prophet, and promised to divide the river for their passage; and saying these things, he deceived many, says Josephus. But Fadus sent a troop of horse against them, who, falling unexpectedly upon them, killed many, and made many prisoners; and having taken Theudas himself alive, they cut off his head and brought it to Jerusalem. A few years afterward, in the reign of Nero, when Felix was procurator of Judea, such a number of these impostors made their appearance, that many of them were apprehended and killed every day. They seduced great numbers of the people still expecting the Messiah. Our Saviour might well, therefore, caution his disciples against them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:1-3 Christ foretells the utter ruin and destruction coming upon the temple.

The most beautiful body soon will be food for worms, and the most magnificent building a ruinous heap. See ye not all these things? It will do us good so to see them as to see through them, and see to the end of them.

This He does, not by noticing them distinctly, but by intermingling the descriptions of the destruction of Jerusalem and of the end of the world, so that it is sometimes difficult to tell to what particular subject his remarks apply. The principle on which this combined description of two events was spoken appears to be, that "they could be described in the same words," and therefore the accounts are intermingled. A similar use of language is found in some parts of Isaiah, where the same language will describe the return from the Babylonian captivity, and deliverance by the Messiah.

Which was on the east of the city of Jerusalem (a), "over against the temple", as Mark says, and where he could sit and take a full view of it; for the wall on the east side was lower than any other, and that for this reason; that when the high priest burnt the red heifer on this mount, as he did, and sprinkled the blood, he might have a view of the gate of the temple. It is said (b), <p>"all the walls which were there, were very high, except the eastern wall; for the high priest, when he burned the heifer, stood on the top of the mount of Olives, and directed himself, and looked to the gate of the temple, at the time he sprinkled the blood.'' <p>This place, very probably, our Lord chose to sit in, that he might give his disciples an occasion to discourse more largely with him on this subject; and that he might take the opportunity of acquainting them with what would be the signs and forerunners of this desolation, and so it proved: <p>the disciples came to him privately; these four at least, Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, as Mark relates; and that either separately from the rest of the disciples, or from the multitude: it might not be thought so proper, to ask the following questions before them, and they might suppose that Christ would not be so ready to give an answer to them plainly, before the common people; when they might hope to be indulged with one by him, in private: <p>saying, tell us, when shall these things be? That this house will be left desolate, these buildings will be destroyed, and not one stone left upon another? This first question relates purely to the destruction of the temple, and to this Christ first answers, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-4.htm">Matthew 24:4</a>. <p>And what shall be the sign of thy coming, and of the end of the world? Which two are put together, as what they supposed would be at the same time, and immediately follow the destruction of the temple. That he was come in the flesh, and was the true Messiah, they firmly believed: he was with them, and they expected he would continue with them, for they had no notion of his leaving them, and coming again. When he at any time spake of his dying and rising from the dead, they seemed not to understand it: wherefore this coming of his, the sign of which, they inquire, is not to be understood of his coming a second time to judge the world, at the last day; but of his coming in his kingdom and glory, which they had observed him some little time before to speak of; declaring that some present should not die, till they saw it: wherefore they wanted to be informed, by what sign they might know, when he would set up his temporal kingdom; for since the temple was to be destroyed, they might hope a new one would be built, much more magnificent than this, and which is a Jewish notion; and thai a new state of things would commence; the present world, or age, would be at a period; and the world to come, they had so often heard of from the Jewish doctors, would take place; and therefore they ask also, of the sign of the end of the world, or present state of things in the Jewish economy: to this Christ answers, in the latter part of this chapter, though not to the sense in which they put the questions; yet in the true sense of the coming of the son of man, and the end of the world; and in such a manner, as might be very instructive to them, and is to us. <p>(a) Bartenora in Misn.

This verse accordingly shows us Jesus with His disciples now on the other side of the Kidron, and sitting on the slope of Olivet, with face turned towards Jerusalem; Master and disciples sitting apart, and thinking their own thoughts. Satisfied that the Master means what He has said, and not daring to dispute His prophetic insight, they accept the fate predicted for Jerusalem, and now desire to know the when and how.—<span class="greekheb">κατʼ ἰδίαν</span> looks as if borrowed from Mk., where it refers to four of the disciples coming apart from the rest. It goes without saying that none but the Twelve were there.—<span class="greekheb">τί τὸ σημεῖον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>., etc. The questioners took for granted that all three things went together: destruction of temple, advent of Son of Man, end of the current age. Perhaps the association of the three helped them to accept the first as a fact.

On his way to Bethany towards the close of this day, he rested for a while and communed with the disciples, uttering the wonderful eschatological discourse which follows in this and the next chapter. It is noted that the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans began on the very spot where this prophecy of its destruction was delivered, strategical reasons compelling them to make their attack from this quarter. "A sudden turn in the road," writes Dr. Edersheim (2:431), "and the sacred building was once more in full view. Just then the western sun was pouring his golden beams on tops of marble cloisters and on the terraced courts, and glittering on the golden spikes on the roof of the holy place. In the setting, even more than in the rising sun, must the vast proportions, the symmetry, and the sparkling sheen of this mass of snowy marble and gold have stood out gloriously. And across the black valley, and up the slopes of Olivet, lay the dark shadows of those gigantic walls built of massive stones, some of them nearly twenty-four feet long. Even the rabbis, despite their hatred of Herod, grow enthusiastic, and dream that the very temple walls would have been covered with gold had not the variegated marble, resembling the waves of the sea, seemed more beauteous. It was probably, as they [the disciples] now gazed on all this grandeur and strength, that they broke the silence imposed on them by gloomy thoughts of the near desolateness of that house which the Lord predicted." <span class="cmt_word">Privately</span>.  Such questions were not to be asked openly in the hearing of any who might have followed him from the city. There was nothing more resented by the average Jew than any intimation of the destruction of the temple. It was one of the charges against Stephen that he had said that Jesus would destroy the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-14.htm">Acts 6:14</a>). When, therefore, some of the apostles wished for more definite information on this subject, they took care to make their inquiry in private. Their questions were twofold - they desired to know the time of the events, and the signs which should precede Christ's coming and the end of the world. <span class="cmt_word">When shall these things be?</span> "These things" refer to the destruction of the temple, and the course of events which, as they conceive, are dependent thereupon (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-36.htm">Matthew 23:36</a>). To their minds, this catastrophe could only occur contemporaneously with the coming of Christ in glory and the end of the world. They saw in it a great revolution which should usher in the final consummation. But when should this come to pass? - in their own day, or after many ages? in the lifetime of this generation, or at some far-distant period? It was not mere wanton curiosity to know the future which prompted the question, but rather a reverent desire to prepare for these great events, of the certainty of which they were now fully assured. So the next question shows no doubt concerning the facts, and asks, not the mode of the accomplishment, but only what anticipatory warning and indication were to be given. <span class="cmt_word">Sign of thy coming</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>), <span class="cmt_word">and of the end of the world</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f30;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). They look upon these two events as synchronous, or very closely connected. The word <span class="accented">parousia</span>, which in classical Greek means "presence," or "arrival," is used in the New Testament specially for the second advent of Christ to set up his eternal kingdom in full power and glory (see in this chapter vers. 27, 37, 39; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, etc.). Referring to the same event, we find in some places the term "epiphany" used (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm">1 Timothy 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-1.htm">2 Timothy 4:1</a>), and in others "revelation" (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-7.htm">1 Corinthians 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-7.htm">2 Thessalonians 1:7</a>); but the three expressions denote simply the open establishment of Messiah's kingdom, indefnitely as to time and manner. The phrase translated "the end of the world "means literally <span class="accented">the consummation of the age</span> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-39.htm">Matthew 13:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>); <span class="accented">consummationis saeculi</span> (Vulgate); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the close of this present seen, in contradistinction from the future aeon, or the world to come. This is "the last time," "the last days," spoken of elsewhere (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm">1 Peter 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; and comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Coming (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Originally, presence, from &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to be present.
