Is it distinct from the coming of the Son of Man which here is so closely united with it? Men have given wildly conjectural answers to these questions, and have dreamt of the cross as appearing in the sky (as if the vision of Constantine were to be reproduced in the last days), or the lightning flash that shall dazzle all men with its brightness, or of some visible manifestation which none can imagine till it shall come. The vision of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a> supplies, it is believed, the true answer. The sign of the Son of Man is none other than the presence of the Son of Man Himself, coming in the clouds of heaven, in the ineffable glory of His majesty. And here, too, we must remember that we are still in the region of apocalyptic symbols. All such imagery falls short of the ultimate reality, and a “sign in heaven” is something more than a visible appearance in the sky.<p><span class= "bld">Then shall all the tribes of the earth.</span>—It lies in the nature of the case, that the “tribes” are those who have done evil, and who therefore dread the coming of the Judge.

Even so, Amen.">Revelation 1:7</a>, where St. John combines them freely with the prediction of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>, “They also which pierced Him,” obviously including not only those who were sharers in the actual “piercing” of the crucified body of the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-37.htm" title="And again another scripture said, They shall look on him whom they pierced.">John 19:37</a>), but all who in any age “crucify the Son of God afresh” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-6.htm" title="If they shall fall away, to renew them again to repentance; seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.">Hebrews 6:6</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory....">Matthew 24:30-31</a></span>. <span class="ital">Then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven </span>— Christ proceeds here in the same figurative style, and the plain meaning of his words is, that the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Jewish state, civil and religious, would be such a remarkable instance of divine vengeance, and such a signal manifestation of Christ’s power and glory, that all the Jewish tribes should mourn, and many should be led from thence to acknowledge him for the true Messiah. To explain this further it may be observed, “The <span class="ital">sign from heaven, </span>which both the disciples and Pharisees expected, was some visible appearance of the Messiah in the clouds, and some miraculous interposition of his power, by which the Romans, the masters of the world, were to be destroyed, and a universal empire over all nations erected in behalf of the Jews. This sign they were led to expect, because Daniel had said prophetically, of the Son of man, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>,) that he saw him <span class="ital">coming in the clouds of heaven, </span>and that there was given him <span class="ital">dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, </span>&c. Nevertheless, by the coming of the Son of man in the clouds, Daniel meant his interposing for the destruction of his enemies, particularly the unbelieving Jews; and the erection of his own kingdom over all nations; a spiritual kingdom, a new dispensation of religion, which should comprehend the whole world within its pale. Therefore, to show the disciples that they had mistaken the prophecy, which referred wholly to the destruction of Jerusalem, and to the conversion of the Gentiles, he adopted it into his prediction of these events, and thereby settled its true meaning.” — Macknight. The figurative expression, <span class="ital">Coming in the clouds of heaven, </span>in several other passages of Scripture, signifies God’s interposing evidently and irresistibly, to execute vengeance on a wicked generation, and to assert his own government over the world. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/22-10.htm" title="He bowed the heavens also, and came down; and darkness was under his feet....">2 Samuel 22:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-2.htm" title="Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne.">Psalm 97:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm" title="The burden of Egypt.

No person, versed at all in ecclesiastical history, needs to be told that the Christian religion spread and prevailed mightily after this period; and that hardly any one thing contributed more to this success of the gospel than the destruction of Jerusalem and the ruin of the Jewish nation, falling out in the very manner and with the very circumstances so particularly foretold by our Lord.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:29-41 Christ foretells his second coming. It is usual for prophets to speak of things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness and certainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretold that there shall be a great change, in order to the making all things new. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At his first coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shall shortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they have pierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endless horror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there are some in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shall keep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should never cease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predicting were fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment; therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease to exist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men of the world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but they plan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and most certain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away every human scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will be as surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first, to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment. Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. They were secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and they believed not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortly pass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it far from them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of our Saviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, and suddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their house employments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside, and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I prepared to meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day of judgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The sign of the Son of man - The "evidence" that he is coming to destroy the city of Jerusalem. It is not to be denied, however, that this description is applicable also to his coming at the day of judgment. The disciples had asked him <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a> what should be the sign of his coming, and "of the end of the world." In his answer he has reference to both events, and his language may be regarded as descriptive of both. At the destruction of Jerusalem, the sign or evidence of his coming was found in the fulfillment of these predictions. At the end of the world, the sign of his coming will be his personal approach with the glory of his Father and the holy angels, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-27.htm">Luke 21:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-11.htm">Acts 1:11</a>.<p>All the tribes of the earth mourn - That is, either all the "tribes or people" of the land of Judea shall mourn at the great calamities coming upon them, or all the nations of the world shall wail when he comes to judgment. All the wicked shall mourn at the prospect of their doom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>.

They had been always seeking a sign, and were continually asking one of him; and now they will have a sign with a witness; as they had accordingly, <p>And then shall the tribes of the earth, or land,  <p>mourn; that is, the land of Judea; for other lands, and countries, were not usually divided into tribes, as that was; neither were they affected with the calamities and desolations of it, and the vengeance of the son of man upon it; at least not so as to mourn on that account, but rather were glad and rejoiced: <p>and they shall see the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory. The Arabic version reads it, "ye shall see", as is expressed by Christ, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>. Where the high priest, chief priests, Scribes, and elders, and the whole sanhedrim of the Jews are spoken to: and as the same persons, namely, the Jews, are meant here as there; so the same coming of the son of man is intended; not his coming at the last day to judgment; though that will be in the clouds of heaven, and with great power and glory; but his coming to bring on, and give the finishing stroke to the destruction of that people, which was a dark and cloudy dispensation to them: and when they felt the power of his arm, might, if not blind and stupid to the last degree, see the glory of his person, that he was more than a mere man, and no other than the Son of God, whom they had despised, rejected, and crucified; and who came to set up his kingdom and glory in a more visible and peculiar manner, among the Gentiles. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And then shall appear the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the <span class="cverse3">{o}</span> tribes of the earth <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> mourn, and they shall see the Son of man <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.</span><p>(n) The exceeding glory and majesty, which will bear witness that Christ the Lord of heaven and earth draws near to judge the world.<p>(o) All nations, and he alludes to the dispersion which we read of in Ge 10-11, or to the dividing of the people of Israel.<p>(p) They will be in such sorrow, that they will strike themselves: and it is transferred to the mourning.<p>(q) Sitting upon the clouds, as he was taken up into heaven.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/24.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.">Matthew 24:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ τότε</span>] <span class="ital">and then</span>, when what is intimated at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a> shall have arrived.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">φανήσεται</span>] universally, and so not visible merely to the elect (Cremer), which would not be in keeping with what follows.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ σημεῖον τοῦ υἱοῦ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>.] accordingly the sign inquired about in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>, that phenomenon, namely, which is immediately to precede the coming Messiah, the Son of man of <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.">Daniel 7:13</a>, and which is to indicate that His second advent is now on the point of taking place, which is to be the <span class="ital">signal</span> of this latter event. As Jesus does not say <span class="ital">what</span> this is to be, it should be left quite indefinite; only this much may be inferred from what is predicted at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a> about the <span class="ital">darkening</span> of the heavenly bodies, that it must be of the nature of a <span class="ital">manifestation of light</span>, the dawning of the Messianic <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> which is perhaps to go on increasing in brilliancy and splendour until the Messiah Himself steps forth from the midst of it in the fulness of His glory. There is no foundation for supposing, with Cyril, Hilary, Chrysostom, Augustine, Jerome, Erasmus, that the allusion is to a <span class="ital">cross</span> appearing in the heavens; with Hebart, that it is to the rending of heaven or the appearing of angels; with Fleck and Olshausen, that it is to the <span class="ital">star</span> of the Messiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm" title="I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not near: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth.">Numbers 24:17</a>); similarly Bleek, though rather more by way of conjecture. Following the older expositors, Fritzsche, Ewald, Hengstenberg, R. Hofmann understand the coming <span class="ital">Messiah Himself:</span> “miraculum, quod Jesus revertens Messias oculis objiciet” (accordingly, taking <span class="greekheb">τοῦ υἱοῦ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀνθρ</span>. as a genitive of <span class="ital">subject;</span> while Wolf, Storr, Weiss, <span class="ital">Bibl. Theol.</span> p. 56, ed. 2, assume it to be a genitive of <span class="ital">apposition</span>). This view is inconsistent not only with what follows, where the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὄψονται τὸν υἱὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. evidently point to something still farther in the future, and which the <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> serves to introduce, but also with the question of the disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>. R. Hofmann thinks that the reference is to that apparition in the form of a man which is alleged to have stood over the holy of holies for a whole night while the destruction of the capital was going on. A legendary story (chronicled by Ben-Gorion); and it may be added that what is said, vv 29–31, certainly does not refer to the destruction of Jerusalem, <span class="ital">after</span> which event Hofmann supposes our evangelist to have written. Lastly, some (Schott, Kuinoel) are even of opinion that <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> does not point to any new and special circumstance at all—to anything beyond <span class="ital">what is contained</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>; but the introduction of the <span class="ital">sequel</span> by <span class="greekheb">τότε</span> is decidedly against this view.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τότε</span>] a new point brought forward: <span class="ital">and then</span>, when this <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span> has been displayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κόψονται</span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm" title="And I will pour on the house of David, and on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications: and they shall look on me whom they have pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn.">Zechariah 12:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

But this explanation seems to confuse the sign and that which it represents, the token of Messiah and Messiah himself who cometh afterward. And the definite article, "<span class="accented">the</span> sign," seems to imply something already well known to denote him, whereas his appearance could not be known beforehand. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A star, which shall herald his second coming, as a star announced his birth.

This, which doubtless will be manifested, was indeed a token  of the presence of God, but could not be recognized at once as the sign of the Son of man. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(4)</span> We come to what has been the almost universal interpretation of the Fathers and early commentators, who saw in the sign the cross of Christ, which is indeed the ensign and standard of the gospel. Nothing, equally with this, can characterize the Son of man, the emblem of his humiliation and his triumph. <span class="cmt_word">Then</span>. When they behold this sign in the sky, and know unmistakably that Christ in person is about to appear. <span class="cmt_word">Shall all the tribes of the earth mourn</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">shall beat the breast</span>).

The cross shows that he died for them, though they profited not by his sacrifice (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm">Revelation 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-15.htm">Revelation 6:15-17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">They shall see</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>,, an echo of the preceding <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>). The sign is followed by the advent of Christ in person. <span class="cmt_word">Coming in the clouds of heaven.</span> Some have taken "clouds" to mean angels, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-27.htm">Matthew 16:27</a>; but them is no need for considering the term here to be metaphorical. The accompaniments of the theophanies are always thus announced (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-10.htm">Psalm 18:10-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-13.htm">Daniel 7:13</a>, etc.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm">Matthew 26:64</a>). He thus claims to be the God of whom these words are continually used, and he leaves his hearers to gather that he will come visibly, not spiritually to individual souls or Churches, but manifestly to the whole of mankind, whether quick or risen. <span class="cmt_word">With power.</span> In his full omnipotence. <span class="accented">Cum virtute multa</span> (Vulgate). The expression must not be taken as denoting the attendant angels; they are named in the next verse. It denotes that he who on earth met with naught but pain and humiliation should be displayed to the same earth with that splendour and majesty which essentially belonged to him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/24.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Mourn (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;).<p>Stronger: beat their breasts in anguish </body></html>
