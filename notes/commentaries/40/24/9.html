(See Notes there.) Here we have “hated of all the nations,” <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> heathen nations, instead of the wider “hated of all men.” So, when Paul reached Rome, the “sect” of the Christians was “everywhere spoken against” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm" title="But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.">Acts 28:22</a>) “as evildoers” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1Peter 2:12</a>).

Now the calamities which were to befall the Christians were cruel persecutions, and we need look no further than the Acts of the Apostles for the completion of this prediction. But if we would look further, we have still a more melancholy proof of the truth of it in the persecutions under Nero, in which, not to mention numberless other Christians, those two great champions of the Christian faith, Peter and Paul, fell. Indeed, as Tertullian calls it, it was <span class="ital">nominis prælium, </span>a war against the very name. For though a man was possessed of every human virtue, it was crime enough if he was a Christian; so true were our Saviour’s words, that they should <span class="ital">be hated of all nations for his name’s sake.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:4-28 The disciples had asked concerning the times, When these things should be? Christ gave them no answer to that; but they had also asked, What shall be the sign? This question he answers fully. The prophecy first respects events near at hand, the destruction of Jerusalem, the end of the Jewish church and state, the calling of the Gentiles, and the setting up of Christ's kingdom in the world; but it also looks to the general judgment; and toward the close, points more particularly to the latter. What Christ here said to his disciples, tended more to promote caution than to satisfy their curiosity; more to prepare them for the events that should happen, than to give a distinct idea of the events. This is that good understanding of the times which all should covet, thence to infer what Israel ought to do. Our Saviour cautions his disciples to stand on their guard against false teachers. And he foretells wars and great commotions among nations. From the time that the Jews rejected Christ, and he left their house desolate, the sword never departed from them. See what comes of refusing the gospel. Those who will not hear the messengers of peace, shall be made to hear the messengers of war. But where the heart is fixed, trusting in God, it is kept in peace, and is not afraid. It is against the mind of Christ, that his people should have troubled hearts, even in troublous times. When we looked forward to the eternity of misery that is before the obstinate refusers of Christ and his gospel, we may truly say, The greatest earthly judgments are but the beginning of sorrows. It is comforting that some shall endure even to the end. Our Lord foretells the preaching of the gospel in all the world. The end of the world shall not be till the gospel has done its work. Christ foretells the ruin coming upon the people of the Jews; and what he said here, would be of use to his disciples, for their conduct and for their comfort. If God opens a door of escape, we ought to make our escape, otherwise we do not trust God, but tempt him. It becomes Christ's disciples, in times of public trouble, to be much in prayer: that is never out of season, but in a special manner seasonable when we are distressed on every side. Though we must take what God sends, yet we may pray against sufferings; and it is very trying to a good man, to be taken by any work of necessity from the solemn service and worship of God on the sabbath day. But here is one word of comfort, that for the elect's sake these days shall be made shorter than their enemies designed, who would have cut all off, if God, who used these foes to serve his own purpose, had not set bounds to their wrath. Christ foretells the rapid spreading of the gospel in the world. It is plainly seen as the lightning. Christ preached his gospel openly. The Romans were like an eagle, and the ensign of their armies was an eagle. When a people, by their sin, make themselves as loathsome carcasses, nothing can be expected but that God should send enemies to destroy them. It is very applicable to the day of judgment, the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in that day, 2Th 2:1. Let us give diligence to make our calling and election sure; then may we know that no enemy or deceiver shall ever prevail against us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To be afflicted - By persecution, imprisonment, scourging, etc.<p>"They shall deliver you up to councils" (Mark).

Seeing that the expressions are distinctly <span class="ital">different</span> from each other. it is not enough to appeal to the “<span class="ital">elasticity</span>” of the <span class="greekheb">τότε</span> (Hoelemann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀποκτενοῦσιν ὑμᾶς</span>] spoken <span class="ital">generally</span>, not as intimating, nor even presupposing (Scholten), the death of <span class="ital">all</span> of them. After <span class="greekheb">παραδώς</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> the current of prophetic utterance flows regularly on, leaving to the hearers themselves to make the necessary distinctions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔσεσθε μισούμενοι</span>] It is a mistake to suppose that we have here a reference to Nero’s persecution (proceeding upon an erroneous interpretation of the well-known “odio humani generis” in Tacit. <span class="ital">Ann.</span> xv. 44, see Orelli on the passage), because it is the <span class="ital">disciples</span> that are addressed; and to regard them as the representatives of Christians <span class="ital">in general</span>, or as the <span class="ital">sum total of the church</span> (Cremer), would be arbitrary in the highest degree; the discourse does not become general in its character till <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-10.htm" title="And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.">Matthew 24:10</a>.

But we are not justified in saying more, and especially when we take into account the prophetic colouring given to our discourse, must we beware of straining the <span class="greekheb">πάντων</span> in order to favour the notion that the expression contains an allusion to the vast and long-continued efforts that would be made to disseminate the gospel throughout the world (Dorner); let us repeat that it is the <span class="ital">apostles</span> who are in question here.

This passage Weiss regards as an interpolation into the prophetic discourse by Matthew following Mark. It certainly resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-17.htm" title="But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;...">Matthew 10:17-22</a> (much less, however, than the corresponding passage in Mk.), and individual phrases may be interpolations: but something of the kind was to be expected here. The disciples were not to be mere spectators of the tragedy of the Jewish nation destroying itself. They were to be active the while, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, propagating the new faith, bringing in a new world. Jesus would have them go on with their work undistracted by false enthusiasms, or warlike terrors, and to this end assures them that they will have both to do and to suffer a great deal before the final crisis of Jerusalem comes. The ground of this prophetic forecast as to their experience is faith that God will not allow the work He (Jesus) has inaugurated to perish. The gospel will be preached widely, with whatever tribulations to the preachers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/24.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-9.htm" title="Then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted, and shall kill you: and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.">Matthew 24:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκτενοῦσιν ὑμᾶς</span>, <span class="ital">they shall kill you</span>) sc. some of you; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-16.htm" title="And you shall be betrayed both by parents, and brothers, and kinfolks, and friends; and some of you shall they cause to be put to death.">Luke 21:16</a>.
