It is usual for prophets to speak of things as near and just at hand, to express the greatness and certainty of them. Concerning Christ's second coming, it is foretold that there shall be a great change, in order to the making all things new. Then they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds. At his first coming, he was set for a sign that should be spoken against, but at his second coming, a sign that should be admired. Sooner or later, all sinners will be mourners; but repenting sinners look to Christ, and mourn after a godly sort; and those who sow in those tears shall shortly reap in joy. Impenitent sinners shall see Him whom they have pierced, and, though they laugh now, shall mourn and weep in endless horror and despair. The elect of God are scattered abroad; there are some in all places, and all nations; but when that great gathering day comes, there shall not one of them be missing. Distance of place shall keep none out of heaven. Our Lord declares that the Jews should never cease to be a distinct people, until all things he had been predicting were fulfilled. His prophecy reaches to the day of final judgment; therefore he here, ver. 34, foretells that Judah shall never cease to exist as a distinct people, so long as this world shall endure. Men of the world scheme and plan for generation upon generation here, but they plan not with reference to the overwhelming, approaching, and most certain event of Christ's second coming, which shall do away every human scheme, and set aside for ever all that God forbids. That will be as surprising a day, as the deluge to the old world. Apply this, first, to temporal judgments, particularly that which was then hastening upon the nation and people of the Jews. Secondly, to the eternal judgment. Christ here shows the state of the old world when the deluge came. They were secure and careless; they knew not, until the flood came; and they believed not. Did we know aright that all earthly things must shortly pass away, we should not set our eyes and hearts so much upon them as we do. The evil day is not the further off for men's putting it far from them. What words can more strongly describe the suddenness of our Saviour's coming! Men will be at their respective businesses, and suddenly the Lord of glory will appear. Women will be in their house employments, but in that moment every other work will be laid aside, and every heart will turn inward and say, It is the Lord! Am I prepared to meet him? Can I stand before him? And what, in fact, is the day of judgment to the whole world, but the day of death to every one?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So likewise ye ... - In the same manner, when you see what I have predicted the "signs" around Jerusalem - then know that its destruction is at hand,<p>Is near - Luke says <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>, "your redemption draweth nigh, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-31.htm">Luke 21:31</a> the kingdom of God is nigh at hand."

That are mentioned above, relating to the signs of the destruction of the temple and city, and the destruction itself, with all those several things that should directly take place upon it; this is an accommodation of the above parable, similitude, or comparison: <p>know that it is near, even at the doors; meaning, either that "he is near", as the Ethiopic version reads it, the son of man is near, even at the doors; or as the Vulgate Latin renders it, "in the gates", or "doors", and so does Munster's Hebrew Gospel; and signifies, that he was already come; for to be in the doors, or within the gates, is more than to be at the doors, or at the gates: and thus the fig tree putting forth its leaves, is a sign that summer is not only nigh, but is already come, even that part of it we call spring; for the Scripture divides the whole year only into two parts, summer and winter; so these calamities and desolations on the Jews, were a sign that the son of man was come, was in the gates, displaying his power and his glory: or the redemption and deliverance of the people of God was at hand, from the persecutions of the Jews; for till the destruction of Jerusalem, the persecutions of the Christians were chiefly from the Jews, or occasioned by them; but now, they being destroyed, the summer of deliverance was at hand: or else the kingdom of God, or a more enlarged state of the Gospel dispensation was near; the winter of the legal dispensation was over, the spring of the Gospel dispensation was come, through the preaching of John the Baptist, Christ and his apostles; and now the summer of it was at hand, through the general spread of it, all over the Gentile world. So the second coming of Christ, will be a summer of joy and comfort to the saints: Christ will appear most lovely and amiable to them, he will be glorified by them, and admired in them; great grace will be brought unto them, and great glory will be put upon them; they will then enjoy full redemption and salvation: the winter of sorrows, afflictions, and persecutions, and of coldness, darkness, and desertion, will be over; the sun shall no more go down, nor the moon withdraw itself, but the Lord will be the everlasting light of his people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/24.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/24.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.">Matthew 24:33</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὕτως κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑ</span>, so do ye also when ye see all these things, recognise that it is nigh, at the doors.

The present is the first passage which has required this to be demonstrated; we will therefore do so [by the following examples]:—(1.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm" title="If your whole body therefore be full of light, having no part dark, the whole shall be full of light, as when the bright shining of a candle does give you light.">Luke 11:36</a>, <span class="greekheb">εἰ οὖν τὸ σῶμά σου ὉΛΟΝ φωτεινὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔχον τὶ ΜΕΡΟΣ σκοτεινὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔσται ΦΩΤΕΙΝΟΝ ὅλον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὅταν ὁ λύχνος τῇ ἀστραπῇ ΦΩΤΙΖΗ σέ</span>, <span class="ital">if then thy body</span> [be] ALL <span class="ital">light, not having any</span> PART <span class="ital">dark, it shall be</span> LIGHT <span class="ital">all over, as when the candle by its shining</span> LIGHTETH <span class="ital">thee</span>. In this passage <span class="greekheb">ὁλον</span> (<span class="ital">all, the whole</span>, Lat. <span class="ital">totum</span>, Fr. <span class="ital">tout</span>) is emphatic before <span class="greekheb">φωτεινὸν</span> (<span class="ital">light</span>, Lat. <span class="ital">lucidum</span>), in opposition to <span class="greekheb">μέρος</span> (<span class="ital">part</span>): and <span class="greekheb">φωτεινὸν</span> is emphatic before <span class="greekheb">ὅλον</span>, its emphasis being declared by the verb <span class="greekheb">φωτὶζῃ</span> (<span class="ital">lighteth</span>, Lat. <span class="ital">illuminet</span>. (2.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/14-2.htm" title="In my Father's house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you....">John 14:2-3</a>, <span class="greekheb">πορεύομαι ἑτοιμάσαι ΤΟΠΟΝ ὑμῖν</span>. <span class="greekheb">καῖ ἐὰν πορευθῶ καὶ ἑτοιμάσω ὙΜΙΝ τόπον</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. <span class="ital">I go to prepare</span> A PLACE <span class="ital">for you, and if I go and prepare</span> FOR YOU <span class="ital">a place</span>, etc. Here the apparent contradiction is removed by the order of the words, “A PLACE <span class="ital">is not to be prepared for you, since it is already prepared</span>,”[1058] is the negative proposition. “FOR YOU <span class="ital">is to be prepared a place, i.e.</span> the entrance into that place is to be rendered sure,” is the affirmative proposition. Both are equally true. (3.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;">Ephesians 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-5.htm" title="Even when we were dead in sins, has quickened us together with Christ, (by grace you are saved;)">Ephesians 2:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὙΜΑΣ ὄντας νεκροὺς</span>—<span class="greekheb">ὈΝΤΑΣ ἡμᾶς νεκροὺς</span>, YOU <span class="ital">being dead</span>—BEING <span class="ital">us dead</span> [Fr. VOUS <span class="ital">etant morts</span>, ETANT <span class="ital">nous morts</span>]. Here <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> (<span class="ital">you</span>) is put antithetically to <span class="greekheb">ἡμᾶς</span> (<span class="ital">us</span>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a> : and then <span class="greekheb">ὄντας</span> (<span class="ital">being</span>), denotes the past <span class="ital">state</span> of death, opposed to vivification. (4.) <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-18.htm" title="Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.">Jam 2:18</a>, <span class="greekheb">δεῖξόν μοι τὴν ΠΙΣΤΙΝ σου ἐκ</span> (others read <span class="greekheb">χωρὶς</span>[1059]) <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἔργων σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ δείξω σοι ἐκ τῶν ἘΡΓΩΝ μου τὴν πίστιν μου</span>, <span class="ital">Show me thy</span> FAITH <span class="ital">by</span> (others read <span class="ital">without) thy</span> WORKS, <span class="ital">and I will show thee by my</span> WORKS <span class="ital">my faith</span>. Here the first <span class="greekheb">πίστιν</span> (faith) refers to the words <span class="greekheb">σὺ πίστιν ἔχεις</span> (thou hast faith), and the second, <span class="greekheb">ἔργων</span> (<span class="ital">works</span>), to the words <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἔργα ἔχω</span> (<span class="ital">and I have works</span>). These instances, extracted from four different writers of the New Testament, will suffice for the present. Now let us return to St Matthew. As the best MSS. have <span class="greekheb">ΤΑΥΤΑ πάντα</span>, THESE <span class="ital">things all</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-33.htm" title="So likewise you, when you shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the doors.">Matthew 24:33</a>, and <span class="greekheb">ΠΑΝΤΑ ταυτα</span>, ALL <span class="ital">these things</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-34.htm" title="Truly I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till all these things be fulfilled.">Matthew 24:34</a> (although others confound the two modes of expression);[1060] the first <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> placed before <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> is emphatic, so as to express things about to happen next (for which reason in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-29.htm" title="So you in like manner, when you shall see these things come to pass, know that it is near, even at the doors.">Mark 13:29</a>; the <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> is omitted); and this emphasis being granted, the second <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span> expresses <span class="ital">all</span>, including <span class="ital">these</span>, things which were to come to pass next, in that generation. The pronoun <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> (<span class="ital">these</span>) does not refer to the whole preceding discourse (for the previous signs, and the events which were to follow them indicated by the signs, are distinct from each other), but to the beginnings, which are compared with the fig-tree, in contradistinction to the summer itself, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the approaching kingdom of God. Those things having been fulfilled which are described from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-4.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man deceive you.">Matthew 24:4</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-28.htm" title="For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together.">Matthew 24:28</a>, room was made for the kingdom of God, which would grow stronger and stronger, in one continuous progress. The beginnings, after all hindrances had been removed, were equivalent to the whole.[1061] Furthermore, in St Matthew and St Mark, <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span> (<span class="ital">these</span>) is in each case contrasted with <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνης</span> (<span class="ital">that</span>) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-36.htm" title="But of that day and hour knows no man, no, not the angels of heaven, but my Father only.">Matthew 24:36</a>, with the following sense: THESE <span class="ital">all which concern Jerusalem shall come to pass before this generation passes away; but of</span> THAT (remoter and last) <span class="ital">day</span> (of judgment) <span class="ital">knoweth no one</span>, etc. This observation facilitates the interpretation of the whole of this discourse. St Luke also contrasts with each other <span class="greekheb">ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">these</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐκείνη</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>. See Gnomon on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-36.htm" title="Watch you therefore, and pray always, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.">Luke 21:36</a>.—<span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye know</span>, Indicative): Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-32.htm" title="Now learn a parable of the fig tree; When his branch is yet tender, and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near:">Matthew 24:32</a>, or <span class="ital">know ye</span>, Imperative.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς</span>, <span class="ital">near</span>) sc. the thing itself is.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ θύραις</span>, <span class="ital">at the doors) i.e.</span> extremely near.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1058] See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-34.htm" title="Then shall the King say to them on his right hand, Come, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:">Matthew 25:34</a>, “Inherit the kingdom <span class="ital">prepared</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἡτοιμασμένην</span>) <span class="ital">for you from the foundation of the world</span>.”—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1059] Such is the reading of E.
