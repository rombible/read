He that is unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord:">1Corinthians 7:32-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm" title="Be careful for nothing; but in every thing by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.">Philippians 4:6</a>), expresses anxiety, literally, the care which <span class= "ital">distracts</span> us. And this was, in the sixteenth century, the meaning of the English phrase “take thought.” Of this we have one example in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm" title="And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.">1Samuel 9:5</a>; other examples of it are found in Shakespeare, “<span class= "ital">take thought,</span> and die for Cæsar” (<span class= "ital">Julius Cæsar,</span> ii. 1), or Bacon (<span class= "ital">Henry the Eighth,</span> p. 220), who speaks of a man “dying with <span class= "ital">thought</span> and anguish” before his case was heard. The usage of the time, therefore, probably led the translators of 1611 to choose the phrase, as stronger than the “be not careful” which in this passage stood in all previous versions. The changing fortune of words has now made it weaker, and it would be better to substitute “over-careful” or “over-anxious.” The temper against which our Lord warns His disciples is not that of foresight, which merely provides for the future, but the allowing ourselves to be harassed and vexed with its uncertainties. To “take thought” in the modern sense is often the most effectual safeguard (next to the higher defence of trust in God) against “taking thought” in the older.<p><span class= "bld">For your life.</span>—The Greek word is the same as that commonly rendered “soul,” and the passage is interesting as an example of its use in the wider sense which includes the lower as well as the higher life. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-39.htm" title="He that finds his life shall lose it: and he that loses his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 10:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-25.htm" title="For whoever will save his life shall lose it: and whoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.">Matthew 16:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-4.htm" title="And he said to them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save life, or to kill?

We hear the language of One who speaks to peasants with their simple yet pressing wants, not to the wider cares of the covetous or ambitious of a higher grade.<p><span class= "bld">Is not the life more than meat, . . .?</span>—The reasoning is <span class= "ital">à fortiori.</span> God has given you the greater, can you not trust Him to give you also the less? In some way or other there will come food to sustain life, and clothing for the body, and men should not so seek for more as to be troubled about them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on.

For we are not to suppose that our Lord here commands us absolutely to <span class="ital">take no thought </span>for our <span class="ital">life, food, </span>and <span class="ital">raiment; </span>because, in other parts of Scripture, diligence in business is inculcated, and men are commanded <span class="ital">to labour with their hands, </span>that they may provide for the supply of their own wants, and also those of others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm" title="Not slothful in business; fervent in spirit; serving the Lord;">Romans 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-28.htm" title="Let him that stole steal no more: but rather let him labor, working with his hands the thing which is good, that he may have to give to him that needs.">Ephesians 4:28</a>; and that, instead of being useless loads on the earth, they may, at all times, have it in their power to discharge the several duties of life with decency, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm" title="And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary uses, that they be not unfruitful.">Titus 3:14</a>. What Christ therefore here forbids is, not that thought, foresight, and care which prudent men use in providing sustenance and needful support for themselves, and those dependant upon them; but it is such an <span class="ital">anxious care, </span>as arises from want of faith in the being, perfections, and providence of God, and in the declarations and promises of his word, and therefore such an anxious solicitude as engrosses the thoughts and desires of the soul, so as either utterly to exclude or greatly damp and hinder spiritual affections, pursuits, and labours; or which prevents our receiving or our retaining and increasing in the love of God, and the true religion connected therewith. <span class="ital">Is not the life more than </span>the <span class="ital">meat, </span>needful to support it? <span class="ital">And the body than </span>the <span class="ital">raiment, </span>necessary to clothe it? and will not he, who has given the greater blessings, give the less also? <span class="ital">Behold the fowls of the air </span>— Learn a lesson from the birds that now fly round you. <span class="ital">For they sow not, neither do they reap, </span>&c. — Without foreseeing their own wants, or making provision for them, they are preserved and nourished by the unwearied benignity of the divine providence. <span class="ital">Are ye not much better than they? </span>— Are ye not beings of a nobler order, and destined for a higher end than they, and therefore more the objects of the divine care? Moreover, <span class="ital">which of you, by taking thought</span> — Gr. <span class="greekheb">μεριμνων</span>, <span class="ital">by being anxiously careful, can add one cubit unto his stature? </span>Can add one moment to the length of your lives; that is, which of you could profit yourselves at all by anxious thoughts and cares, if you should indulge them? It is evident, as several learned writers have observed, that the word <span class="greekheb">ηλικια</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">stature, </span>ought to have been translated <span class="ital">age, </span>because the caution is against anxious care about the preservation of life, and about food, the means of prolonging it; not to mention that Jesus is speaking here to full-grown men, who probably had no solicitude about their stature. Besides, the measure of a <span class="ital">cubit </span>agrees much better to a man’s <span class="ital">age </span>than to his <span class="ital">stature, </span>the smallest addition to which would have been better expressed by <span class="ital">a hair’s breadth, </span>or the like, than by a <span class="ital">cubit, </span>which is more than the fourth part of the whole height of most men. This interpretation of the word is confirmed by Luke in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/12-25.htm" title="And which of you with taking thought can add to his stature one cubit?...">Luke 12:25-26</a>, where he calls the adding of a cubit, <span class="ital">that which is least </span>— That is the thing in which the interposition of the divine providence least appears, as it really is, if understood of the addition of a single moment to the length of one’s life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:25-34 There is scarcely any sin against which our Lord Jesus more warns his disciples, than disquieting, distracting, distrustful cares about the things of this life. This often insnares the poor as much as the love of wealth does the rich. But there is a carefulness about temporal things which is a duty, though we must not carry these lawful cares too far. Take no thought for your life. Not about the length of it; but refer it to God to lengthen or shorten it as he pleases; our times are in his hand, and they are in a good hand. Not about the comforts of this life; but leave it to God to make it bitter or sweet as he pleases. Food and raiment God has promised, therefore we may expect them. Take no thought for the morrow, for the time to come. Be not anxious for the future, how you shall live next year, or when you are old, or what you shall leave behind you. As we must not boast of tomorrow, so we must not care for to-morrow, or the events of it. God has given us life, and has given us the body. And what can he not do for us, who did that? If we take care about our souls and for eternity, which are more than the body and its life, we may leave it to God to provide for us food and raiment, which are less. Improve this as an encouragement to trust in God. We must reconcile ourselves to our worldly estate, as we do to our stature. We cannot alter the disposals of Providence, therefore we must submit and resign ourselves to them. Thoughtfulness for our souls is the best cure of thoughtfulness for the world. Seek first the kingdom of God, and make religion your business: say not that this is the way to starve; no, it is the way to be well provided for, even in this world. The conclusion of the whole matter is, that it is the will and command of the Lord Jesus, that by daily prayers we may get strength to bear us up under our daily troubles, and to arm us against the temptations that attend them, and then let none of these things move us. Happy are those who take the Lord for their God, and make full proof of it by trusting themselves wholly to his wise disposal. Let thy Spirit convince us of sin in the want of this disposition, and take away the worldliness of our hearts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought ... - The general design of this paragraph, which closes the chapter, is to warn his disciples against avarice, and, at the same time, against anxiety about the supply of their needs. This he does by four arguments or considerations, expressing by unequalled beauty and force the duty of depending for the things which we need on the providence of God. The "first" is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>; "Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?" In the beginning of the verse he charged his disciples to take "no thought" - that is, not to be "anxious" about the supply of their wants. In illustration of this he says that God has given "life," a far greater blessing than "meat;" that he has created the body, of far more consequence than raiment. Shall not he who has conferred the "greater" blessing be willing to confer the "less?" Shall not he who has formed the body so curiously, and made in its formation such a display of power and goodness, see that it is properly protected and clothed? He who has displayed "so great" goodness as to form the body, and breathe into it the breath of life, will surely "follow up" the blessing, and confer the "smaller" favor of providing that that body shall be clothed, and that life preserved.<p>No thought - The word "thought," when the Bible was translated, meant "anxiety," and is so used frequently in Old English authors. Thus, Bacon says, "Haweis died with 'thought' and anguish before his business came to an end." As such it is used here by our translators, and it answers exactly to the meaning of the original. Like many other words, it has since somewhat changed its signification, and would convey to most readers an improper idea. The word "anxiety" would now exactly express the sense, and is precisely the thing against which the Saviour would guard us. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-14.htm">Luke 8:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-34.htm">Luke 21:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>. "Thought" about the future is right; "anxiety, solicitude, trouble" is wrong. There is a degree of "thinking" about the things of this life which is proper. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>. But it should not be our supreme concern; it should not lead to anxiety; it should not take time that ought to be devoted to religion.<p>For your life - For what will "support" your life.<p>Meat - This word here means "food" in general, as it does commonly in the Bible. We confine it now to animal food. When the Bible was translated, it denoted all kinds of food, and is so used in the old English writers. It is one of the words which has changed its meaning since the translation of the Bible was made.<p>Raiment - Clothing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought&#8212;"Be not solicitous." The English word "thought," when our version was made, expressed this idea of "solicitude," "anxious concern"&#8212;as may be seen in any old English classic; and in the same sense it is used in 1Sa 9:5, &c. But this sense of the word has now nearly gone out, and so the mere English reader is apt to be perplexed. Thought or forethought, for temporal things&#8212;in the sense of reflection, consideration&#8212;is required alike by Scripture and common sense. It is that anxious solicitude, that oppressive care, which springs from unbelieving doubts and misgivings, which alone is here condemned. (See Php 4:6).<p>for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on&#8212;In Luke (Lu 12:29) our Lord adds, "neither be ye unsettled"&#8212;not "of doubtful mind," as in our version. When "careful (or 'full of care') about nothing," but committing all in prayer and supplication with thanksgiving unto God, the apostle assures us that "the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus" (Php 4:6, 7); that is, shall guard both our feelings and our thoughts from undue agitation, and keep them in a holy calm. But when we commit our whole temporal condition to the wit of our own minds, we get into that "unsettled" state against which our Lord exhorts His disciples.<p>Is not the life more than meat&#8212;food.<p>and the body than raiment?&#8212;If God, then, gives and keeps up the greater&#8212;the life, the body&#8212;will He withhold the less, food to sustain life and raiment to clothe the body?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This text must not be interpreted in a sense contradictory to those many other texts, which forbid an idle life, an command us in the sweat of our face to eat our bread, or to provide for our families, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/3-10.htm" title="For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.">2 Thessalonians 3:10</a>,11 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a></span>: nor did Christ himself live such a life; he went about doing good, finishing the work which his Father had given him to do.

Since ye cannot serve both God and "mammon", obey one, and neglect the other. Christ does not forbid labour to maintain, support, and preserve, this animal life; nor does he forbid all thought and care about it, but all anxious, immoderate, perplexing, and distressing thoughts and cares; such as arise from diffidence and unbelief, and tend to despair; which are dishonourable to God, as the God of nature and providence, and uncomfortable to men: <p>what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink, nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. The several and the only things, which are necessary for the support and comfort of human life, are mentioned; as meat, drink, and clothing; Eating and drinking are necessary to preserve life; and raiment, to cover and defend the body, from the injuries of the heavens: and having these, men have everything necessary, and ought herewith to be content; nor should they be anxiously thoughtful about these: for <p>is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment? And yet, God has given these without man's thought: and since these are better, and much more excellent, than food and raiment, as all must and will acknowledge; and God has given these the greater gifts, it may be depended upon, that he will give the lesser; that he will give meat and drink; to uphold that valuable life, which he is the author of; and raiment to clothe that body, which he, with so much wisdom and power, has accurately and wonderfully made. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on.

It seems probable that in the differences Luke preserves the more original form (cf. the notes on the separate verses, <span class="accented">infra</span>). What their original position was is another question. Their immediate sequence in Luke to the parable of the rich fool is no doubt perfectly natural, and is accepted by most commentators as original; but the connexion with the context here is so close that, especially with the probabilities of the case in vers. 22, 23, and ver. 24, St. Matthew <span class="cmt_word"></span> may, after all, have recorded them in their original place. Our Lord says in these verses, "Dare to follow out this warning that I have given you about double service into your daily life. Do not give way to anxiety about the things of life, but look up to God in steady gaze of faith; he will provide." 'Or, more in detail - If God has given you life, shall he not add the food and the clothing (ver. 25)? Anxiety about the support of your life is needless (witness the birds, ver. 26) and powerless (witness the limit of a man's life, ver. 27); while as for clothing, it is equally needless (witness the flowers, ver. 28) and comparatively powerless (witness Solomon's own case, ver. 29). Remember your relation to God (ver. 30). Therefore do not give way to the least anxiety about these things (ver. 31), because this is to fall to the level of the Gentiles, and also because God, whose children you are, knows your needs (ver. 32). But make his cause, without and within, your great object, and all your needs shall be supplied (ver. 33). Therefore be not at all anxious, bear the burden of each day only as each day comes round (ver. 34). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Therefore</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>). Because of this fact last mentioned, the impossibility of dividing your service. Cease to be anxious about things of this life, for anxiety about these is a mark of your attempting this impossibility. <span class="cmt_word">I say unto you</span>. Though the absence of the personal pronoun (unlike <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>, etc.) shows that he is not here contrasting himself with them or with others, yet he still emphasizes his authority. <span class="cmt_word">Take no thought</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">be not anxious</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb6;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>). The translation of the Authorized Version, which was quite correct in its day (cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-5.htm">1 Samuel 9:5</a>), is now archaic, and therefore often misunderstood. For the popular derivation of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> ("division," "distraction"), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-33.htm">1 Corinthians 7:33</a>, "But he that is married is anxious for (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1fb7;</span>) the things of the world, how he may please his wife, and is divided (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." Observe that forethought in earthly matters was practised by our Lord himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-6.htm">John 12:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">For your life</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). In the Gospels <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> is the immaterial part of man, his personality as we should say, which survives death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>), and is the chief object of a man's care (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-39.htm">Matthew 10:39</a>, where see note). <span class="cmt_word">What ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink</span>. Although the second clause is omitted by <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span> and a few chiefly "Western" authorities, it is probably genuine, especially as there is no trace of it in Luke (but cf. Westcott and Heft, 'Introd.,' p. 176). <span class="cmt_word">Is not the life more than meat?</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> you possess the greater, shall there not be given to you the less?

Similarly before "raiment." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Take no thought (&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>The cognate noun is &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, care, which was formerly derived from &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c2;, a part; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;, to divide; and was explained accordingly as a dividing care, distracting the heart from the true object of life, This has been abandoned, however, and the word is placed in a group which carries the common notion of earnest thoughtfulness. It may include the ideas of worry and anxiety, and may emphasize these, but not necessarily. See, for example, "careth for the things of the Lord" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-32.htm">1 Corinthians 7:32</a>). "That the members should have the same care one for another" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-25.htm">1 Corinthians 12:25</a>). "Who will care for your state?" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20</a>). In all these the sense of worry would be entirely out of place. In other cases that idea is prominent, as, "the care of this world," which chokes the good seed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-22.htm">Matthew 13:22</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-14.htm">Luke 8:14</a>). Of Martha; "Thou art careful" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-41.htm">Luke 10:41</a>). Take thought, in this passage, was a truthful rendering when the A. V. was made, since thought was then used as equivalent to anxiety or solicitude. So Shakspeare ("Hamlet"):<p>"The native hue of resolution<p>Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought."<p>And Bacon (Henry VII.): "Hawis, an alderman of London, was put in trouble, and died with thought and anguish." Somers' "Tracts" (in Queen Elizabeth's reign): "Queen Catherine Parr died rather of thought."<p>The word has entirely lost this meaning. Bishop Lightfoot ("On a Fresh Revision of the New Testament") says: "I have heard of a political economist alleging this passage as an objection to the moral teaching of the sermon on the mount, on the ground that it encouraged, nay, commanded, a reckless neglect of the future." It is uneasiness and worry about the future which our Lord condemns here, and therefore Rev. rightly translates be not anxious. This phase of the word is forcibly brought out in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm">1 Peter 5:7</a>, where the A. V. ignores the distinction between the two kinds of care. "Casting all your care (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, Rev., anxiety) upon Him, for He careth (&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;) for you," with a fatherly, tender, and provident care." </body></html>
