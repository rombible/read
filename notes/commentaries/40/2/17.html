But, as this cruel execution here related by the evangelist, extended itself to all the neighbouring places, and in particular to this same Ramah, a town of Benjamin, which lay near to Bethlehem, the prophet’s words are, with great propriety, applied to this melancholy event likewise, and are represented as receiving a second accomplishment in the bloody slaughter of these infants. And when it is considered that the Jews who were carried captive were not slain, but lived many of them to return again, as the Prophet Jeremiah foretold, <span class="ital">to their own border, </span>it must be allowed, that the prediction was much more literally fulfilled on this latter than on the former occasion. This application of the prophecy by the evangelist affords a sure proof that a passage of Scripture, whether prophetical, historical, or poetical, may, in the language of the New Testament, be said to be fulfilled, when an event happens to which it may with great propriety be accommodated.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:13-15 Egypt had been a house of bondage to Israel, and particularly cruel to the infants of Israel; yet it is to be a place of refuge to the holy Child Jesus. God, when he pleases, can make the worst of places serve the best of purposes. This was a trial of the faith of Joseph and Mary. But their faith, being tried, was found firm. If we and our infants are at any time in trouble, let us remember the straits in which Christ was when an infant. 16-18 Herod killed all the male children, not only in Bethlehem, but in all the villages of that city. Unbridled wrath, armed with an unlawful power, often carries men to absurd cruelties. It was no unrighteous thing with God to permit this; every life is forfeited to his justice as soon as it begins. The diseases and deaths of little children are proofs of original sin. But the murder of these infants was their martyrdom. How early did persecution against Christ and his kingdom begin! Herod now thought that he had baffled the Old Testament prophecies, and the efforts of the wise men in finding Christ; but whatever crafty, cruel devices are in men's hearts, the counsel of the Lord shall stand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then was fulfilled - The word "fulfilled," here. is used evidently in the sense that the words in Jeremiah aptly express the event which Matthew was recording. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-22.htm">Matthew 1:22</a>.<p>That which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet - Jeremiah. This quotation is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. The original design of the prophecy was to describe the sorrowful departure of the people of Israel into captivity after the conquest of Jerusalem by Nebuzaradan. The captives were assembled at Rama, Jeremiah himself being in chains, and there the fate of those who had escaped in the destruction of the city was decided at the will of the conqueror, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-1.htm">Jeremiah 40:1</a>. The nobles had been slain; the sons of the king had been murdered in his presence; the eyes of the king had been put out, and the people were then gathered at Rama in chains, whence they were to start on their mournful journey, slaves to a cruel monarch, leaving behind them all that was dear in life. The sadness of such a scene is well expressed in the language of the prophet, and it no less beautifully and suitably applies to the melancholy event which the evangelist records, and there could be no impropriety in his using it as a quotation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17.

By the slaughter of the infants at Bethlehem was literally accomplished what had been predicted by <p>Jeremy the prophet, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a>. <p>in Rama was there a voice heard, &amp;c. That this prophecy belongs not to the Babylonish captivity, but the times of the Messiah, appears from the whole context; which manifestly speaks of the miraculous conception of Christ, of the blessings of his kingdom to be enjoyed by his people, and of the new covenant to be made with them, as I have shown in another place (r). Rama was not in Arabia, as Justin Martyr says (s), but a town in the tribe of Benjamin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-25.htm">Joshua 18:25</a> and very near to Bethlehem in the tribe of Juda: between these two places, and near to both of them, was the grave of Rachel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a> for which reason, and also because Rama belonged to Benjamin, a son of hers, and where, no doubt, many children were destroyed in this massacre, as well as at Bethlehem, Rachel is introduced in the prophecy representing the sorrowful mothers of those parts, <p>weeping for their children; whose distress and grief are signified by several words, "lamentation, weeping and great mourning", to express the excessiveness thereof, for they <p>would not be comforted; they refused to hear anything that might be suggested to them for their relief, because their children <p>were not, i.e. were dead, were not in the land of the living, and no more to be enjoyed by them in this world. I cannot forbear transcribing a remark made by a noted Jew (t) upon that passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-20.htm">Genesis 35:20</a>. "And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave"; to show, says he, that Jacob saw that this thing was of the Lord, and that it would be an help to her children, as it is written, "a voice was heard in Rama", &amp;c. wherefore he set a pillar upon her; and to show that the affair of her grave, that this  "belonged to the time to come", he says, "that is the pillar of Rachel's grave unto this day": he means, , "the day of redemption". And Rachel, in the passage of Jeremy, the Jews (u) themselves own, means the congregation of Israel. <p>(r) Prophecies of the Messiah, &amp;c. p. 126, &amp;c. (s) Dialog. cum Tryph. p. 304. (t) R.

(cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/37-35.htm">Genesis 37:35</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> As to the quotation generally. St. Matthew applies Jeremiah's picture of Rachel, the mother of Joseph, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Ephraim (and also Manasseh), which was the typical part of the northern kingdom, weeping over the destruction of her children by the Assyrians, to the weeping of the mothers in Bethlehem. This application was the more easy because, as Rachel's tomb was near Bethlehem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-19.htm">Genesis 35:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48.htm">Genesis 48</a>.7), she might be considered the figurative ancestress of the Bethlehe-mites as well as the physical ancestress of the Ephraimites. The fulfilment spoken of is thus not to be understood as implying that Jeremiah predicted the massacre at Bethlehem, but that in it his words received a new and deeper significance. It must, however, be added that, although Rachel's tomb is placed at Bethlehem, both by the direct statement of the present text of Genesis and by tradition, which may be traced at least as far back as A.D. , and is accepted by Jews, Christians, and Mohammedans, there are serious doubts whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-2.htm">1 Samuel 10:2</a> does not definitely place it in the north of Benjamin, and whether <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-15.htm">Jeremiah 31:15</a> does not accept this latter view (cf. for this question Delitzsch, on Genesis, <span class="accented">loc. cit.</span>) . In any case, St. Matthew adopts the statement of Genesis. </body></html>
