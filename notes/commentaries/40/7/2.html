The unjust judgment of man does not bring upon us a divine judgment which is also unjust; but the severity which we have unjustly meted out to others, becomes, by a retributive law, the measure of that which is justly dealt out to us.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With what judgment ... - This was a proverb among the Jews. It expressed a truth; and Christ did not hesitate to adopt it as conveying his own sentiments. It refers no less to the way in which people will judge of us, than to the rule by which God will judge us. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-27.htm">2 Samuel 22:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-24.htm">Mark 4:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm">James 2:13</a>.<p>Mete - Measure. You shall be judged by the same rule which you apply to others. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. For with what judgments ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with what measure ye mete&#8212;whatever standard of judgment ye apply to others.<p>it shall be measured to you again&#8212;This proverbial maxim is used by our Lord in other connections&#8212;as in Mr 4:24, and with a slightly different application in Lu 6:38&#8212;as a great principle in the divine administration. Unkind judgment of others will be judicially returned upon ourselves, in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ. But, as in many other cases under the divine administration, such harsh judgment gets self-punished even here. For people shrink from contact with those who systematically deal out harsh judgment upon others&#8212;naturally concluding that they themselves may be the next victims&#8212;and feel impelled in self-defense, when exposed to it, to roll back upon the assailant his own censures.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 1,2. Our Saviour must not be understood here prohibiting any judgment, which is elsewhere in holy writ allowed, for the Holy Spirit doth not command and prohibit the same thing; whence it if evident, that it is not to be understood of political or ecclesiastical judgments, nor was our Saviour here speaking to any such persons: it is therefore to be understood of private judgments, nor of them absolutely, for it is lawful for us to judge ourselves, yea, it is our duty, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-31.htm" title="For if we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged.">1 Corinthians 11:31</a></span>: Nor is that judgment of our neighbour’s opinions or actions here forbidden which terminates in ourselves, in our satisfaction as to the truth or falsehood of the former, or the goodness or badness of the latter; we ought so to prove all things in order to our holding fast that which is good. Nor is all judgment of our neighbour’s actions with reference to him forbidden: how can we reprove him for his errors, or restore him that is fallen, without a previous judgment of his actions? But that which is here forbidden, is either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. A rash judgment of his state, or a judging him for doing his duty: such was Simon’s judging the woman, or the disciples’ judgment of that woman, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>,9</span>.

Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. A judging them for secret things, such as inward habits of grace, when no apparent fruits to the contrary are seen. Or, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Condemning others for single acts, of a public censuring and condemning others for private failings. Or: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. Finally, Any open and public censuring the actions of others, when and where it cannot conduce either to God’s glory or our brother’s good. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">That ye be not judged:</span> this is expounded in the next verse, telling us either the ordinary temper of men, or the just judgment of God, repaying such uncharitable actions <span class="ital">per legem talionis, </span> with suffering others to do the like to us, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-37.htm" title="Judge not, and you shall not be judged: condemn not, and you shall not be condemned: forgive, and you shall be forgiven:">Luke 6:37</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged,.... Both by God and men; to which agree those proverbial sentences used by the Jews; <p>"He that judgeth his neighbour according to the balance of righteousness, or innocence, they judge him according to righteousness.'' <p>(w) And a little after, <p>"As ye have judged me according to the balance of righteousness, God will judge you according to the balance of righteousness.'' <p>Hence that advice of Joshua ben Perachiah (x), who, by the Jewish writers, is said to be the master of Christ; <p>"Judge every man according to the balance of righteousness.'' <p>Which their commentators explain thus (y); when you see a man as it were in "equilibrio", inclining to neither part, it is not clear from what he does, that he is either good or evil, righteous or unrighteous; yet when you see him do a thing which may be interpreted either to a good or a bad sense, it ought always to be interpreted to the best. <p>And with what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again. This was an usual proverb among the Jews; it is sometimes delivered out thus,  , "measure against measure" (z); but oftener thus, and nearer the form of it here,     , "with what measure a man measures, they measure to him": one might fill up almost a page, in referring to places, where it is used in this form: besides those in the (a) margin, take the following, and the rather, because it gives instances of this retaliation (b): <p>""With what measure a man measures, they measure to him"; so the woman suspected of adultery, she adorned herself to commit sin, and God dishonoured her; she exposed herself to iniquity, God therefore stripped her naked; the same part of her body in which her sin begun, her punishment did. Samson walked after his eyes, and therefore the Philistines plucked out his eyes. Absalom was lifted up in his mind, with his hair, and therefore he was hanged by it; and because he lay with his father's ten concubines, they therefore pierced him with ten lances; and because he stole away three hearts, the heart of his father, the heart of the sanhedrim, and the heart of Israel, therefore he was thrust with three darts: and so it is with respect to good things; Miriam waited for Moses one hour, therefore the Israelites waited for her seven days in the wilderness; Joseph, who was greater than his brethren, buried his father; and Moses, who was the greatest among the Israelites took care of the bones of Joseph, and God himself buried Moses.'' <p>(w) T.
