How was the narrow way to be found? Who would act as guide? Many would offer their help who would simply lead men to the destruction which they sought to escape. Such teachers, claiming authority as inspired, there had been in the days of Isaiah and Jeremiah, and there would be again. The true gift of prophecy is always followed by its counterfeit. Even at the time when our Lord was speaking, the influence of such men as Judas of Galilee (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-37.htm" title="After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people after him: he also perished; and all, even as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.">Acts 5:37</a>), Theudas, and other popular leaders, was still fresh in men’s memories.<p><span class= "bld">Which come to you in sheep’s clothing.</span>—The illustration implies something like the conception of the wolf disguising himself as a sheep in order to gain entrance into the fold. So far a special feature is added to the general allegory of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-12.htm" title="But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees: and the wolf catches them, and scatters the sheep.">John 10:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>. It is possible, though not, I think, probable, that there may be some allusion to the “rough garments,” the “sheep-skins and goat-skins” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm" title="They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;">Hebrews 11:37</a>, worn by false prophets of the hermit or ascetic type.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/7.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves....">Matthew 7:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Beware of false prophets </span>— Who in their preaching describe a broad way to heaven: it is their <span class="ital">prophesying, </span>their <span class="ital">teaching </span>the broad way, rather than <span class="ital">walking </span>in it themselves, that is <span class="ital">here </span>chiefly spoken of.

As prophets, however, were commonly regarded as public instructors on the subject of religion, the word came to denote all who were religious teachers. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-6.htm">Romans 12:6</a>. In this sense it is probably used here. A false prophet is a teacher of incorrect doctrine, or one falsely and unjustly laying claims to divine inspiration. It probably had reference to the false teachers then among the Jews.<p>Who come in sheep's clothing - The sheep is an emblem of innocence, sincerity, and harmlessness. To come in sheep's clothing is to assume the appearance of sanctity and innocence, when the heart is evil.<p>Ravening wolves - Rapacious; voraciously devouring; hungry even to rage. Applied to the false teachers, it means that they assumed the appearance of holiness in order that they might the more readily get the property of the people. They were full of extortion and excess.

Or false teachers; for not such who pretended to foretell things to come, but such who set up themselves to be teachers of others, are here meant; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-1.htm">2 Peter 2:1</a>. It may be queried, whether our Lord has not respect to the Scribes and Pharisees, who sat in Moses's chair, and taught, for doctrines, the commandments of men? and of whose doctrines he elsewhere bids men beware: for whatever plausible pretences for holiness and righteousness might appear in them, they were repugnant to the word of God, and destructive to the souls of men; such as their doctrines of free will, justification by the works of the law, the traditions of the elders, &amp;c. since it follows, <p>which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves; for these "loved to go in long clothing", <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-38.htm">Mark 12:38</a>. <p> in a garment which reached to the feet, and was made of the wool of sheep. The Babylonish garment Achan saw and stole, Rab says (r), was , a garment called "melotes": which is the very Greek word the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews uses for sheep skins, persecuted saints wandered about in, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a> and the gloss upon the place, in the Talmud referred to, says, that this was   , "a talith", or "garment of pure wool"; and Jarchi (s) says, that <p>"it was the way of deceivers, and profane men, to cover themselves,  "with their talith", or long garment, "as if they were righteous men", that persons might receive their lies.'' <p>All which agrees very well with the Pharisees, who would have been thought to have been holy and righteous, humble, modest, and self-denying men; when they were inwardly full of hypocrisy and iniquity, of rapine, oppression, and covetousness; and, under a pretence of religion, "devoured widows' houses". Though, it seems, by what follows, that Christ has respect, at least also, to such, who bore his name, and came in his name, though not sent by him, and called him Lord, and prophesied, and cast out devils, and did many wonderful works in his name; who, that they might get the good will and affections of the people, clothed themselves, not in garments made of sheep's wool, but in the very skins of sheep, with the wool on them, in imitation of the true prophets, and good men of old; pretending great humility, and self-denial, and so "wore a rough garment to deceive", <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4</a> when they were inwardly greedy dogs, grievous wolves, of insatiable covetousness; and, when opportunity offered, spared not the flock to satisfy their rapacious and devouring appetites. The Jews speak of a "wolfish humility"; like that of the wolf in the fable, which put on a sheep skin. <p>"There are some men, (says one of their (t) writers,) who appear to be humble, and fear God in a deceitful and hypocritical way, but inwardly lay wait: this humility our wise men call , "wolfish humility".'' <p>Such is this our Lord inveighs against, and bids his followers beware of. <p>(r) T.

Again, without connecting particle and possibly not a part of the Sermon on the Mount. But the more important question here is: Does this section belong to Christ’s teaching at all, or has it been introduced by the Evangelist that false teachers of after days appearing in the Church might be condemned under the authority of the Master? (Holtz., H.C.). What occasion had Christ to speak of false prophets? The reference can hardly be to the Pharisees or the Rabbis. They were men of tradition, not prophetic, either in the true or in the false sense. But, apart from them, there might be another class of men in evidence in our Lord’s day, who might be so characterised. It was a time of religious excitement; the force of custom broken, the deep fountains of the soul bursting forth; witness the crowds who followed John and Jesus, and the significant saying about the kingdom of heaven suffering violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a>). Such times call forth true prophets and <span class="ital">also</span> spurious ones, so far in religious sympathy with prevalent enthusiasms, but bent on utilising them for their own advantage in gain or influence, men of the Judas type. If such men, as is likely, existed, Jesus would have something to say about them, as about all contemporary religious phenomena.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.">Matthew 7:15</a>. <span class="greekheb">Προσέχετε ἀπὸ</span>, take heed to and beware of.—<span class="greekheb">οἵτινες</span>, I mean, such as.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐνδύμασι προβάτων</span>.

They claim to bring from God the true message of salvation, but their claim is false. These were doubtless found, at the time that our Lord spoke the words, especially among the Pharisees; but when St. Matthew recorded them, chiefly among Christians, either on the Jewish or on the Gnostic side (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20, 21</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a> and 'Did.,' &sect; 12.). <span class="cmt_word">Which</span>; qualitative (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f35;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>); seeing that they. <span class="cmt_word">Come unto you in sheep's clothing.</span> In, as it were, the skins of sheep (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>), professing simplicity and gentleness, and (for, perhaps, this thought is also included) claiming to be members of God's true flock.

The thought of "ravening" (<span class="greek">&#x1f05;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>) is of both violence and greed.
