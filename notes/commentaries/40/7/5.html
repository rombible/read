The hypocrisy is all the greater because it does not know itself to be hypocritical.<p><span class= "bld">Then shalt thou see clearly.</span>—Here the teaching of the Sermon on the Mount rises far above the level of the maxims which, to a certain extent, it resembles. It gives a new motive to the work of self-scrutiny and self-reformation. While we are blind with self-deceit we are but bunglers in the work of dealing with the faults of others. When we have wrestled with and overcome our own besetting sins, then, and not till then, shall we be able, with the insight and tact which the work demands, to help others to overcome theirs.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-6 We must judge ourselves, and judge of our own acts, but not make our word a law to everybody. We must not judge rashly, nor pass judgment upon our brother without any ground. We must not make the worst of people. Here is a just reproof to those who quarrel with their brethren for small faults, while they allow themselves in greater ones. Some sins are as motes, while others are as beams; some as a gnat, others as a camel. Not that there is any sin little; if it be a mote, or splinter, it is in the eye; if a gnat, it is in the throat; both are painful and dangerous, and we cannot be easy or well till they are got out. That which charity teaches us to call but a splinter in our brother's eye, true repentance and godly sorrow will teach us to call a beam in our own. It is as strange that a man can be in a sinful, miserable condition, and not be aware of it, as that a man should have a beam in his eye, and not consider it; but the god of this world blinds their minds. Here is a good rule for reprovers; first reform thyself.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou hypocrite, first cast out ... - Christ directs us to the proper way of forming an opinion of ethers, and of reproving and correcting them. By first amending our own faults, or casting the beam out of our eye, we can "consistently" advance to correct the faults of others. There will then be no hypocrisy in our conduct. We shall also "see clearly" to do it. The beam, the thing that obscured our sight, will be removed, and we shall more clearly discern the "small" object that obscures the sight of our brother. The sentiment is, that the readiest way to judge of the imperfections of others is to be free from greater ones ourselves. This qualifies us for judging, makes us candid and consistent, and enables us to see things as they are, and to make proper allowances for frailty and imperfection. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Thou hypocrite&#8212;"Hypocrite."<p>first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye&#8212;Our Lord uses a most hyperbolical, but not unfamiliar figure, to express the monstrous inconsistency of this conduct. The "hypocrisy" which, not without indignation, He charges it with, consists in the pretense of a zealous and compassionate charity, which cannot possibly be real in one who suffers worse faults to lie uncorrected in himself. He only is fit to be a reprover of others who jealously and severely judges himself. Such persons will not only be slow to undertake the office of censor on their neighbors, but, when constrained in faithfulness to deal with them, will make it evident that they do it with reluctance and not satisfaction, with moderation and not exaggeration, with love and not harshness.<p>Prostitution of Holy Things (Mt 7:6). The opposite extreme to that of censoriousness is here condemned&#8212;want of discrimination of character.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 3-5. Whether the word translated <span class="bld">mote</span> signifieth a mote or a splinter, is of no great concern to know. Our Saviour expounded this text, when he said to the Pharisees, bringing him a woman taken in adultery: <span class="ital">Let him that is guiltless throw the first stone.</span> So doth the apostle Paul, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm" title="Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, whoever you are that judge: for wherein you judge another, you condemn yourself; for you that judge do the same things.">Romans 2:1</a></span>. The text teacheth us these lessons: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That those who are most censorious of others, are usually more notorious and culpable themselves, if not for the same sins, yet for others of equal if not greater magnitude. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That it is notorious hypocrisy to spy smaller faults in others, and not to see greater in ourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. That it is notorious impudence to pretend to censure and judge others for sins in which we live ourselves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. That there is no such way to teach us charity in not hastily, rashly, or too severely judging others, as to look first into our own hearts and ways, and seeing if we have not the same or greater failings. Our charity in this kind should begin at home. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye,.... Very rightly does our Lord call such a man an hypocrite, who is very free in remarking and reproving other men's sins, and covering his own; and indeed, one end of his critical observations, rigid censures, and rash judgments is, that he might be thought to be holier than he is. Christ very manifestly points at the Scribes and Pharisees, who were men of such a complexion; and whom he often, without any breach of charity, calls hypocrites. The meaning of this proverbial expression is, that a man should first begin with himself, take notice of his own sins, reprove himself for them, and reform; and then it will be soon enough to observe other men's. <p>And then shalt thou see clearly, to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye: then will he, and not before, be a proper person to reprove others; all objections and impediments to such a work will then be removed. Our Lord here speaks in the language of the Jewish nation, with whom such like expressions were common, and of long standing (c). <p>"In the generation that judged the judges, one said to another,   , "cast out the mote out of thine eye"; to whom it was replied,   , "cast out the beam from thine eye": one said to another, "thy silver is become dross": the other replies, "thy wine is mixed with water".'' <p>Again (d), <p>"R. Taphon said, I wonder whether there is any in this generation, that will receive reproof; if one should say to him, "cast out the mote out of thine eye", will he say to him, "cast out the beam out of thine eye?" Says R. Eleazer ben Azariah, I wonder whether there is any in this generation, that knows how to reprove.'' <p>From whence it is clear, that these phrases were used in the same sense they are by Christ; and which is still more evident by the gloss upon them: for upon the word "mote", it observes, <p>"That it is as if it had been said, , "a little sin", which is in thine hand (i.e. which thou hast committed): the other could say to him, cast thou away , "the great sin", which is in thine hand; so that they could not reprove, because they were all sinners.'' <p>Agreeable to these, are some other proverbs used by the Jews, such as <p>"a vice which is in thyself, do not speak of to thy neighbour,'' <p>(e) or upbraid him with it: and (f) again, <p>"adorn thyself, and afterwards adorn others.'' <p>Which is produced by a noted commentator (g) of their's, to illustrate the text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-1.htm">Zephaniah 2:1</a> on which he also makes this remark; <p>"inquire first into your own blemishes, and then inquire into the blemishes of others.'' <p>The sense of each of them is, that a man should first reform himself, and then others; and that he that finds faults with others, ought to be without blame himself. <p>continued...<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/7.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-5.htm" title="You hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of your own eye; and then shall you see clearly to cast out the mote out of your brother's eye.">Matthew 7:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὑποκριτά</span>: because he acts as no one should but he who has first reformed himself. “What hast <span class="ital">thou</span> to do to declare my statutes?” <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm" title="But to the wicked God said, What have you to do to declare my statutes, or that you should take my covenant in your mouth?">Psalm 50:16</a>.—<span class="greekheb">διαβλέψεις</span>, thou will see clearly, <span class="ital">vide</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/8-24.htm" title="And he looked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking....">Mark 8:24-25</a>, where three compounds of the verb occur, with <span class="greekheb">ανά</span>, <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>.

The verse seems to imply that if the spirit of censoriousness be absent, it will be possible for us to remove "motes" from the eyes of our brothers. Thus the passage as a whole does not say that we never ought to try to remove such "motes," but that this is monstrous and almost impossible so long as we ourselves have a fault of so much magnitude as censoriousness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/7.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>See clearly (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>The preposition &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;, through, giving the sense of thoroughness.
