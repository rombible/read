The magic power of the art of Raffaelle has brought into vivid juxtaposition the contrast between the scene of glory above and that of trouble and unrest below, but we must not allow the impression made by the picture to distort our thoughts of the history. The two scenes did not synchronise. The vision was at night, and the descent from the mountain would have carried those who made the journey some way at least into the day that followed.<p><span class= "bld">There came to him a certain man.</span>—St. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-14.htm" title="And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.">Mark 9:14-16</a>) narrates more fully that as our Lord and the three were coming to the disciples, they saw a crowd, and scribes disputing with them; that when the multitude saw this they were astonished, and running to Him, saluted Him; that He then asked, “Why dispute ye with them?” and that this drew forth the answer and the prayer which in St. Matthew’s record stands without any prelude.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/17.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/17-14.htm" title="And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,...">Matthew 17:14-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when they were come to the multitude </span>— Namely, the day following, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-37.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they were come down from the hill, much people met him.">Luke 9:37</a>, <span class="ital">there came a certain man, kneeling down to him — </span>In great humility before Jesus, and with deep reverence for him, and <span class="ital">saying, Lord, have mercy on my son </span>— Compassionate his miserable condition, <span class="ital">for he is lunatic and sore vexed </span>— With terrible fits. “This man’s disease,” says Dr. Campbell, “we should, from the symptoms, call <span class="ital">epilepsy, </span>rather than <span class="ital">lunacy. </span>The appellation given it (<span class="greekheb">σεληνιαζεται</span>) shows the general sentiments, at that time, concerning the moon’s influence on this sort of malady.” It appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/9-17.htm" title="And one of the multitude answered and said, Master, I have brought to you my son, which has a dumb spirit;...">Mark 9:17-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-39.htm" title="And, see, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.">Luke 9:39</a>; (where see the notes,) that the disorder, whatever it was, was owing to his being possessed by an evil spirit; he might, nevertheless, be properly said to be <span class="ital">lunatic, </span>though his case was chiefly preternatural, as the evil spirit would undoubtedly take advantage of the influence which the changes of the moon have on the brain and nerves. <span class="ital">I brought him to thy disciples </span>— This he had done in Christ’s absence; <span class="ital">and they could not cure him </span>— Could not cast out the evil spirit, as appeared by their having attempted it without success. Christ gave his disciples power to cast out devils, when he sent them forth to teach and preach, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm" title="And when he had called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.">Matthew 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-8.htm" title="Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: freely you have received, freely give.">Matthew 10:8</a>, and then they were successful; yet, at this time, they failed in the operation, though there were nine of them together: and Christ permitted this, 1st, to keep them humble, and to show them their dependance upon him, and that without him they could do nothing; 2d, to glorify himself and his own power. <span class="ital">Jesus answered, O faithless and perverse generation — </span>In these words our Lord might first intend to reprove both the disciples and the father of the child, for the weakness of their faith. With respect to the disciples, this appears evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a>; but the reproof, contained in the words, could not be designed principally for them: for though their faith was weak, they were not <span class="ital">faithless, </span>nor do they appear to have deserved so sharp a rebuke. It seems to have been intended for the people, and, perhaps, especially the scribes, who are mentioned, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-14.htm" title="And when he came to his disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and the scribes questioning with them.">Mark 9:14</a>, as disputing with the disciples, and, it should seem, insulting over them, as having now met with a case that was too hard for them; a distemper which they could not cure, even by the name and power of their Master. And this conduct of the scribes, which proceeded from their unbelief, was highly criminal, since Jesus had already given so many undeniable demonstrations of his power and divine mission. Therefore he treated them no worse than they deserved, in calling them a faithless and perverse generation, and in adding, <span class="ital">how long shall I be with you </span>— Namely, ere you be convinced? How long shall I suffer you, or bear with your infidelity? A reproof much more applicable to the scribes, than either to the disciples or the father of the child, the weakness of whose faith proceeded from human infirmity, rather than from wilful obstinacy and perverseness. After having thus rebuked the scribes, he turned to the father of the child, and said, <span class="ital">Bring him hither to me </span>— And while he brought him the evil spirit <span class="ital">tare him, and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-20.htm" title="And they brought him to him: and when he saw him, straightway the spirit tare him; and he fell on the ground, and wallowed foaming.">Mark 9:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-42.htm" title="And as he was yet a coming, the devil threw him down, and tare him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.">Luke 9:42</a>. Doubtless Jesus could easily have prevented this attack of the devil, but he wisely permitted it, that the minds of the spectators might be impressed with a more lively sense of the young man’s distress. He then <span class="ital">rebuked the devil. </span>— Commanded him to come out of the youth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm" title="When Jesus saw that the people came running together, he rebuked the foul spirit, saying to him, You dumb and deaf spirit, I charge you, come out of him, and enter no more into him.">Mark 9:25</a>. <span class="ital">And the child was cured from that very hour </span>— The cure was immediate and perfect! Great encouragement this to parents to bring their children, whose souls are under the power of Satan, to Christ, in the arms of faith and prayer! He is able to heal them, and as willing as able.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:14-21 The case of afflicted children should be presented to God by faithful and fervent prayer. Christ cured the child. Though the people were perverse, and Christ was provoked, yet care was taken of the child. When all other helps and succours fail, we are welcome to Christ, may trust in him, and in his power and goodness. See here an emblem of Christ's undertaking as our Redeemer. It encourages parents to bring children to Christ, whose souls are under Satan's power; he is able to heal them, and as willing as he is able. Not only bring them to Christ by prayer, but bring them to the word of Christ; to means by which Satan's strong-holds in the soul are beaten down. It is good for us to distrust ourselves and our own strength; but it is displeasing to Christ when we distrust any power derived from him, or granted by him. There was also something in the malady which rendered the cure difficult. The extraordinary power of Satan must not discourage our faith, but quicken us to more earnestness in praying to God for the increase of it. Do we wonder to see Satan's bodily possession of this young man from a child, when we see his spiritual possession of every son of Adam from the fall!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they were come to the multitude - This took place on the day following the transfiguration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-37.htm">Luke 9:37</a>. This multitude was probably composed of persons who had attended on his ministry, many of whom were his real disciples. With them, as Mark Mar 9:15 informs us, were "scribes questioning with them." That is, they were probably professedly making inquiries about the Saviour, but really attempting to introduce their own sentiments, and to draw them off from him. They probably artfully asked them many questions about his birth, his family, his appearance, his manner of life, and his instructions, all which were contrary to the general expectation respecting the Messiah, and they intended, therefore, to insinuate that such a person could not be the Christ. The people were persuaded that he was the Messiah. and it would not have done to have attacked their opinions openly, but they attempted to gain the same point by sly insinuations. Error is always subtle, and often puts on the appearance of calm and honest inquiry. Well had he compared them to leavens, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/16-11.htm">Matthew 16:11-12</a>. The multitude, seeing Jesus coming down, left the scribes, and ran to meet him (Mark). They were amazed, probably because they had not expected to see him there. In their joy at meeting him in this unexpected manner, they "saluted" him (Mark); that is, probably they prostrated themselves before him after the manner of salutation in Eastern countries. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-4.htm">Luke 10:4</a>. Jesus, seeing the scribes and their artful design, reproved them by asking them why they questioned thus with his disciples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-16.htm">Mark 9:16</a>. Conscious of their guilt and their base purpose, they returned no answer.<p>A certain man kneeling down to him - That is, saluting him, or showing high regard for him.

The contrast between the scene on the mountain and that presented by the demoniac below has been seized by Raphael, in his picture of the Transfiguration, at Rome - the last great work that he painted. The upper part of this picture represents Jesus radiant in glory with the heavenly visitants, while the lower panel shows the agonized father, surrounded by the unbelieving crowd, bringing his tortured son to the apostles, who stand helpless and discredited. The painter has, indeed, sacrificed fact to dramatic effect (as the two events were not synchronous); but the lesson enforced thereby is most impressive, and lays holds of the imagination, showing different phases of the life of Christ, and the realms of light and darkness. <span class="cmt_word">There came to him a</span> certain <span class="cmt_word">man</span>.
