So far as the prophecy of Malachi required the coming of Elijah, that prophecy had been fulfilled in the Baptist, all unconscious of it as he was, as coming in the spirit and power of Elijah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm" title="And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord.">Luke 1:17</a>). The disciples need not look for any other personal appearance. The use of the present and future tenses in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a> point to a deeper truth, which they were to learn afterwards. The Elijah ministry, the work of the preacher of repentance, is not a transient phenomenon belonging to one stage only of the Church’s history, but was to be, throughout the ages, on to the end of all things, the indispensable preparation for the coming of the Lord. Only through it could all things be restored, and the path made ready for the heralds of forgiveness and of peace.<p><span class= "bld">They knew him not.</span>—The Greek word implies full and accurate knowledge. Better, perhaps, <span class= "ital">they recognised him not.</span> Must we not say that those who, after these words, still look forward to the personal advent of Elijah are unconsciously placing themselves on a level with those whose dimness of perception our Lord thus condemns?<p><span class= "bld">But have done unto him whatsoever they listed.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">they did in him</span> (in him, i.e., as the region in which their will wrought) <span class= "ital">whatsoever they would.</span> To “list,” now practically archaic, was the same as “lust,” without the special evil sense which has attached to the latter word. It is significant that our Lord charges the guilt of the rejection and death of John upon the scribes and the people at large, with no special reference to the Tetrarch Antipas. The passions and intrigues of the palace were but instruments working out the intent of the Pharisees and Sadducees.<p><span class= "bld">Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.</span>—Another instance of what may be called the new colour which from the time of the Transfiguration spreads over our Lord’s teaching. All is, in one aspect, darker, sadder, more sombre. He is drawing nearer to the cross, and He brings the thought of the cross closer to the minds of the disciples.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-13 Now the disciples beheld somewhat of Christ's glory, as of the only begotten of the Father. It was intended to support their faith, when they would have to witness his crucifixion; and would give them an idea of the glory prepared for them, when changed by his power and made like him. The apostles were overcome by the glorious sight. Peter thought that it was most desirable to continue there, and to go no more down to meet the sufferings of which he was so unwilling to hear. In this he knew not what he said. We are wrong, if we look for a heaven here upon earth. Whatever tabernacles we propose to make for ourselves in this world, we must always remember to ask Christ's leave. That sacrifice was not yet offered, without which the souls of sinful men could not have been saved; and important services were to be done by Peter and his brethren. While Peter spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, an emblem of the Divine presence and glory. Ever since man sinned, and heard God's voice in the garden, unusual appearances of God have been terrible to man. They fell prostrate to the earth, till Jesus encouraged them; when looking round, they beheld only their Lord as they commonly saw him. We must pass through varied experiences in our way to glory; and when we return to the world after an ordinance, it must be our care to take Christ with us, and then it may be our comfort that he is with us.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Elias is come already - That is, John the Baptist has come, in the spirit and power of Elias.

A way of speaking used by Christ, when he opposes and contradicts any of the tenets of the Scribes and Pharisees; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a> "that Elias is come already"; the person that was signified by, and prophesied of, under the name of Elias: for Christ refers not to the late appearance of Elias on the mount, but to the coming of a certain person some time ago; who came in the power and spirit of Elias, and was the forerunner and harbinger of him, the Messiah; as was said of him he should, "and they knew him not"; that is, the Scribes and Pharisees, who believed that Elias would come before the Messiah; and yet when he who was designed by him was come, they knew him not, they did not know him to be the Elias; they knew him under the name of John the Baptist, and seemed pleased with his ministry for a while, but afterwards rejected his doctrine and baptism, which is referred to in the next clause: <p>but have done unto him whatsoever they listed; they did not believe what he said, nor repent upon his preaching to them; they rejected the counsel of God he declared, not being baptized of him; they treated him with indignity and contempt, charging him with having a devil, and were well pleased when Herod put him to death; some of whom were doubtless among those that sat at meat with him; for whose sake, as well as for his oath's sake, he ordered the execrable murder to be committed: <p>likewise also shall the son of man suffer of them. Christ takes this opportunity to confirm what he had said in the preceding chapter, concerning his sufferings and death; and his meaning is, that as sure as John the Baptist had suffered indignities, and death itself, so sure should the son of man suffer like things; if not from the same individual persons, yet from that generation of men. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/17.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.

Marc</span>. iv. 22, by Herder, Gratz, Krabbe, Bleek, Weizsäcker, Pressensé, Steinmeyer; it would have been nearer the truth if a distinction had been made between the real and the visionary elements contained in it. We have no vision, but a reality in the glorious change which came over the outward appearance of Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/17-1.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes Peter, James, and John his brother, and brings them up into an high mountain apart,...">Matthew 17:1-2</a>, that objective element to which the ecstatic subjective manifestation owed its origin. On the other hand, we cannot but regard as visionary the appearing of Moses and Elias, and that not merely in consequence of <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm" title="And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.">Matthew 17:3</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-3.htm" title="And there appeared to them cloven tongues like as of fire, and it sat on each of them.">Acts 2:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-26.htm" title="And the next day he showed himself to them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brothers; why do you wrong one to another?">Acts 7:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:">1 Corinthians 15:5</a> ff.), but owing to the vanishing away of the heavenly visitants in the cloud, and the impossibility of any bodily manifestation, at least of Moses (whose <span class="ital">resurrection</span> would, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/34-5.htm" title="So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD.">Deuteronomy 34:5</a> f., have to be presupposed).[461] Moreover, Matthew and Mark themselves represent the manifestation of both in such a way, that it is impossible to assert that they regarded it in the light of an actual fact; notice, on the contrary, the different modes of conception as implied in <span class="greekheb">καὶ μετεμορφώθη ἔμπροσθεν αὐτῶν</span> (not: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὬΦΘΗ ΑὐΤΟῖς ΜΕΤΑΜΟΡΦΩΘΕΊς</span></span></span>) and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ ΑὐΤΟῖς ΜΩΣῆς</span></span></span>, etc. Only in the case of Luke is it manifest that he has followed a tradition which has divested the incident of its visionary character (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/9-30.htm" title="And, behold, there talked with him two men, which were Moses and Elias:...">Luke 9:30-31</a>). The of course obvious and common objection, that <span class="ital">three</span> persons must be supposed to have witnessed the <span class="ital">same</span> phenomena and to have heard the <span class="ital">same</span> voice, is deprived of its force if it is conceded, as must necessarily be done, that a supernatural agency was here at work with a view to enable the three leading disciples to have a glimpse beforehand of the approaching glory of Him who was more to them than Moses and the prophets. However, it is attempting too <span class="ital">much</span> to attempt to show the higher naturalism of the incident (Lange, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. II. p. 904 ff., thinks that the heavenly nature of Jesus flashed forth from under the earthly; that the disciples had actually had a peep into the spirit world, and had seen Moses and Elias, which was rendered possible in their case through the peculiar frame of Christ’s mind and the intercourse with those spirits which He enjoyed), in opposition to which Ewald insists that the event was altogether of an ideal character; that the eternal perfection of the kingdom of God was unquestionably disclosed to view, in such a manner, however, that everything of a lower nature, and which was at all calculated to suggest the form which the narrative ultimately assumed, was lost sight of amid the pure light of a higher sphere of things (<span class="ital">Gesch. Chr</span>. p. 462). To assume as the foundation of the story (Baumgarten-Crusius) only some <span class="ital">inward manifestation</span> or other in Jesus Himself, such as led to His obtaining a glimpse of the glory that was to follow His death, is as decidedly <span class="ital">at variance</span> with the statements of the Gospels as it is to trace the matter to a <span class="ital">vision in a dream</span> (Rau, <span class="ital">Symbola ad ill. ev. de metamorph.</span>, etc., 1797; Gabler in the <span class="ital">neuest. theol. Journ</span>. 1798, p. 517 ff., Kuinoel, Neander), in connection with which view some have likewise had recourse to the idea of a thunderstorm (Gabler), and the presence of two secret followers (Kuinoel). This way of looking at the matter is not favoured by <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-32.htm" title="But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.">Luke 9:32</a>. No less inconsistent with the gospel narrative is the hypothesis of a <span class="ital">secret interview with two unknown personages</span> (Venturini, Paulus, Hase, Schleiermacher), in connection with which, again, a good deal has been made of atmospheric illumination, and the effect of the shadows that were projected (Paulus; Theile, <span class="ital">z. Biogr. J</span>. p. 55; Ammon, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 302 ff.). The <span class="ital">mythical</span> view (Strauss, Scholten, Keim)—which regards the narrative as a legendary invention, and substantially ascribes its origin to a desire to see the glory of Moses on Sinai repeated in a higher form in the case of Jesus, and to represent the latter as the fulfilment of the law and the prophets—can least of all be justified here, where it is not only at variance with the studied unanimity of the evangelists in regard to the date of the occurrence, but also with the fact that the testimony of the three apostles must have gone far to prevent the myth from finding its way into the circle of their brethren; while, as regards the silence of John, it is certainly not to be explained on anti-docetic grounds (in answer to Schneckenburger, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 62 ff., see Strauss, II. p. 250), but it is explicable, to say the least of it, on the ground of his ideal conception of Christ’s mundane <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, and no more disproves the reality of the incident in question than his silence regarding so many other important historical facts already recorded by the Synoptists. Further, we must regard as purley supjective, and subversive of the intention and meaning of the evangelists, not merely the <span class="ital">rationalistic</span> explanation of the incident, according to which Jesus is represented as <span class="ital">telling</span> the three disciples <span class="ital">in what relation He stood to Moses and Elias</span>, and as thereby bringing them “<span class="ital">into the light of His Messianic calling</span>” (Schenkel), but likewise the imaginary notion of an admonitory symbol, after the manner of <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-12.htm" title="And I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;">Revelation 1:12</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/11-3.htm" title="And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days, clothed in sackcloth.">Revelation 11:3</a> ff., the historical basis of which is supposed to be contained in the fact that Peter and the first disciples had seen the risen Lord appear in heavenly radiance (Volkmar); and lastly, also the <span class="ital">allegorical</span> view (Weisse), according to which we are understood to have before us the symbolical conception, originating with the three enraptured apostles themselves, of the light which then dawned upon them in regard to the mission of Jesus, especially in regard to His relation to the old theocracy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But, according to Bruno Bauer, the incident is to be regarded as the product of the conviction on the part of the church, that, in the principle on which it is founded, the powers of the past have found their glorified centre of unity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_peter/1-16.htm" title="For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty....">2 Peter 1:16-18</a> can be of no service in the way of confirming the historical character of the incident, except for those who see no reason to reject this Epistle as spurious; but it is of great importance, partly as furnishing, all the same, an ancient testimony in favour of the occurrence itself, and the significance attached to it as a historical event; partly in reference to the telic point of view from which it is to be regarded, namely, as a foreshadowing of the impending <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> of the Lord, in which He is to come back again, and into which His most intimate disciples were in this wonderful way privileged to gaze previous to His sufferings, in order that they might be strengthened for fulfilling the difficult task that would devolve upon them after His ascension. So far as the object of the incident is concerned, it must have been intended expressly for the <span class="ital">disciples</span>, as is evident from <span class="greekheb">ἀκούετε αὐτοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to what has been said above, and judging from what is stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-31.htm" title="But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in all that country.">Matthew 9:31</a> as to the subject of conversation, it may be affirmed that Luke’s account bears the impress of a later stage of development (Fritzsche, Strauss, de Wette, Weisse, Ewald, Weiss), so that in point of originality we must give Matthew the preference (in answer to Schulz, Schleiermacher, Holtzmann, and others), and that even over Mark (comp. Ewald, Köstlin, p. 90; Keim, II. p. 588). See also note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-2.htm" title="And after six days Jesus takes with him Peter, and James, and John, and leads them up into an high mountain apart by themselves: and he was transfigured before them.">Mark 9:2</a> ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[461] It is thus that Origen, Jerome, and other Fathers consistently argue. According to Hilgenfeld, the “Ascension of Moses” (<span class="ital">N. T. extra canon</span>. I. p. 96; <span class="ital">Messias Judaeor</span>. p. 459) was already known to the evangelist; but the <span class="ital">Ascensio Mosis</span> belongs, in any case, to a somewhat later period. Grotius saw himself driven to adopt the expedient of supposing that “haec corpora videri possunt a deo <span class="ital">in hunc usum asservata</span>,” very much as Ambrose had maintained that the body of Moses had been <span class="ital">exempted from putrefaction</span>. According to Calvin, God had raised the bodies <span class="ital">ad tempus</span>. Thomas and several other expositors refer the appearing of Moses to the category indicated by the words: “sicut <span class="ital">angeli</span> videntur.” Similarly Delitzsch, <span class="ital">Psychol</span>. p. 427 [E. T. 499], according to whom the form in which Moses appeared, and which bore a resemblance to His earthly body, was the immaterial product of his spiritualized psychic nature. Gess, with greater indefiniteness, speaks of the manifestation as a coming forth on the part of Moses and Elias from their state of invisibility. But neither Delitzsch nor Gess satisfies the requirements of the words <span class="greekheb">μετʼ αὐτοῦ συλλαλ</span>., which in any case presuppose a glorified <span class="ital">corporeity</span>, or else it amounts to nothing else than a mere appearance. Comp. Beza, who adds: nisi malumus <span class="ital">ecstaticam fuisse visionem</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/17.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-12.htm" title="But I say to you, That Elias is come already, and they knew him not, but have done to him whatever they listed.

The contrast between the mechanical literalism of the scribes and the free spiritual interpretation of Jesus comes out here. Our Lord expected no literal coming of Elijah, such as the Patristic interpreters (Hilary, Chrys., Theophy., Euthy., etc.) supposed Him to refer to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-11.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly shall first come, and restore all things.">Matthew 17:11</a>.

Gnomon on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-9.htm" title="And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given her.">Matthew 14:9</a>. Jesus asserts that Elias has come in the person of John the Baptist; John denies it; both truly, if you compare these apparently conflicting statements with the questions to which they were replies. The Jews asked John, whether he were Elias (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-49.htm" title="The rest said, Let be, let us see whether Elias will come to save him.">Matthew 27:49</a>)—he, that is to say, who was to come before the second advent, or great and terrible day of the Lord. John therefore replies in the negative. The disciples, comparing the opinion of the Scribes with the discourses of Christ, and endeavouring to reconcile them together, fancied that Elijah the Tishbite would come before the first advent; therefore Jesus replies, that <span class="ital">he</span>[787] has already come in the person of John the Baptist.[788]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[785] The world either altogether disbelieves the truth, or else, clinging to mere expectations, refuses to believe the actual fulfilment itself.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[786] <span class="ital">Whatsoever they listed</span>, and that too owing to their evil and wanton <span class="ital">lust</span>. It is this very blind perversity of the world which causes the necessity that one must burst through so many obstacles to a good cause. It not seldom happens, that one who has effected some good, waits in expectation of most splendid recompences from the world on that account. But the man who knows God, the world, and himself, cannot long persist in such an expectation. The merits which receive remuneration of this kind are not spiritual, but worldly.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[787] <span class="ital">i.e., The</span> Elias, who was appointed to precede the first advent.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[788] <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-13.htm" title="Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them of John the Baptist.">Matthew 17:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">περὶ Ἰωάννον</span>, <span class="ital">concerning John</span>) not concerning that Elias, or Elijah, whom they had seen, as recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm" title="And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.">Matthew 17:3</a>.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Elias is come already.</span> The mystical, not the real, Elias, even John the Baptist, who came in the spirit and power of Elias (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-17.htm">Luke 1:17</a>).
