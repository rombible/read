To him, conscious of being of the house of David, and cherishing Messianic hopes, what he heard would seem to come as blighting those hopes. He dared not, as a “righteous” man, take to himself one who seemed thus to have sinned. But love and pity alike hindered him from pressing the law, which made death by stoning the punishment of such a sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-21.htm" title="Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die: because she has worked folly in Israel, to play the whore in her father's house: so shall you put evil away from among you.">Deuteronomy 22:21</a>), or even from publicly breaking off the marriage on the ground of the apparent guilt. There remained the alternative, which the growing frequency of divorce made easy, of availing himself of a “writ of divorcement,” which did not necessarily specify the ground of repudiation, except in vague language implying disagreement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-3.htm" title="The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?">Matthew 19:3</a>). Thus the matter would be settled quietly without exposure. The “bill of divorcement” was as necessary for the betrothed as for those who were fully man and wife.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm" title="Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.">Matthew 1:19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Joseph her husband, being a just </span>[or <span class="ital">righteous</span>] <span class="ital">man </span>— That is, as many understand it, a strict observer of the law, and of the customs of his ancestors, and therefore not judging it right to retain her under these circumstances. But the following words, <span class="ital">and not willing to make her a public example, </span>seem manifestly to lead to another and even an opposite sense of the word here rendered <span class="ital">just, </span>or <span class="ital">righteous. </span>Hence some interpret the clause thus: Joseph, being a <span class="ital">good-natured, merciful, </span>and <span class="ital">tender- hearted </span>man, was unwilling to go to the utmost rigour of the law, but chose rather to treat her with as much lenity as the case allowed. But, Dr. Doddridge very well observes, it is without any good reason that <span class="greekheb">δικαιος </span>should be here rendered <span class="ital">merciful </span>or <span class="ital">good-natured, </span>because, “if we consider the information which Joseph might have received from persons of such an extraordinary character as Zachariah and Elizabeth, who would certainly think themselves obliged to interpose on such an occasion, and whose story so remarkably carried its own evidence along with it; besides the intimation the prophecy of Isaiah gave, and the satisfaction he undoubtedly had in the virtuous character of Mary herself; we must conclude that he would have acted a very severe and unrighteous part, had he proceeded to extremities without serious deliberation; and that <span class="ital">putting her away privately </span>would, in these circumstances, have been the hardest measure which justice would have suffered him to take. It seems the expression, <span class="greekheb">παραδειγματισαι</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">to make her a public example, </span>“may perhaps refer to that exemplary punishment which the law inflicted on those who had violated the faith of their espousals before the marriage was completed. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/22-23.htm" title="If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;...">Deuteronomy 22:23-24</a>, where it is expressly ordered that a betrothed virgin, if she lay with another man, should be stoned. We may suppose, however, that the infamy of a public divorce, though she had not been stoned, may also be expressed by the same word. But then there was besides a private kind of divorce, in which no reason was assigned, and the dowry was not forfeited as in the former case, and by this she would not have been so much defamed.” But it must be observed, that as their being betrothed to each other was a thing publicly known, he could not have put her away so privately, but there must have been witnesses of it, two at least, her parents, suppose, or some of her nearest relations.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God entered into this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours of this world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Her husband - The word in the original does not imply that they were married. It means here the man to whom she was espoused.<p>A just man - Justice consists in rendering to every man his own. Yet this is evidently not the character intended to be given here of Joseph. The meaning is that he was kind, tender, merciful; that he was so attached to Mary that he was not willing that she should be exposed to public shame. He sought, therefore, secretly to dissolve the connection, and to restore her to her friends without the punishment commonly inflicted on adultery. The word just has not unfrequently this meaning of mildness, or mercy. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-9.htm">1 John 1:9</a>; compare Cicero, De Fin. 5, 23.<p>A public example - To expose her to public shame or infamy. Adultery has always been considered a crime of a very heinous nature. In Egypt, it was punished by cutting off the nose of the adulteress; in Persia, the nose and ears were cut off; in Judea, the punishment was death by stoning, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm">Ezekiel 16:38</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-40.htm">Ezekiel 16:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-5.htm">John 8:5</a>. This punishment was also inflicted where the person was not married, but betrothed, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23-24</a>. In this case, therefore, the regular punishment would have been death in this painful and ignominious manner. Yet Joseph was a religious man - mild and tender; and he was not willing to complain of her to the magistrate, and expose her to death, but sought to avoid the shame, and to put her away privately.<p>Put her away privily - The law of Moses gave the husband the power of divorce, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>. It was customary in a bill of divorce to specify the causes for which the divorce was made, and witnesses were also present to testify to the divorce. But in this case, it seems, Joseph resolved to put her away without specifying the cause; for he was not willing to make her a public example. This is the meaning here of "privily." Both to Joseph and Mary this must have been a great trial. Joseph was ardently attached to her, but her character was likely to be ruined, and he deemed it proper to separate her from him. Mary was innocent, but Joseph was not yet satisfied of her innocence. We may learn from this to put our trust in God. He will defend the innocent. Mary was in danger of being exposed to shame. Had she been connected with a cruel, passionate, and violent man, she would have died in disgrace. But God had so ordered it that she was betrothed to a man mild, amiable, and tender: and in due time Joseph was apprised of the truth in the case, and took his faithful and beloved wife to his bosom. Thus, our only aim should be to preserve a conscience void of offence, and God will guard our reputation. We may be assailed by slander; circumstances may be against us; but in due time God will take care to vindicate our character and save us from ruin.

Then Joseph her husband&#8212;Compare Mt 1:20, "Mary, thy wife." Betrothal was, in Jewish law, valid marriage. In giving Mary up, therefore, Joseph had to take legal steps to effect the separation.<p>being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example&#8212;to expose her (see De 22:23, 24)<p>was minded to put her away privily&#8212;that is, privately by giving her the required writing of divorcement (De 24:1), in presence of only two or three witnesses, and without cause assigned, instead of having her before a magistrate. That some communication had passed between him and his betrothed, directly or indirectly, on the subject, after she returned from her three months' visit to Elizabeth, can hardly be doubted. Nor does the purpose to divorce her necessarily imply disbelief, on Joseph's part, of the explanation given him. Even supposing him to have yielded to it some reverential assent&#8212;and the Evangelist seems to convey as much, by ascribing the proposal to screen her to the justice of his character&#8212;he might think it altogether unsuitable and incongruous in such circumstances to follow out the marriage.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It was found she was with child, possibly herself or some of her friends told it to Joseph her espoused husband; it is plain from this text he came to the knowledge of it, for upon it, the evangelist saith, he <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">was minded to put her away privily.</span> Had Joseph at this time heard and believed that the Holy Ghost had come upon her, and the power of the Most High overshadowed her, being a good man, he would not have entertained thoughts of putting her away. But though she had before received this revelation, and might possibly have communicated it to some of her friends, yet it is manifest that her husband Joseph had not heard it, or at least was not easy to believe a thing of so unusual and extraordinary a nature. That she was with child was evident, how she came to be so was as yet hidden from him in nature, and so incredible a thing, as it had argued too much of easiness of belief for him to have believed, had not Joseph had (as afterward he had) a Divine revelation for it: he therefore receiving such a report, and finding it to be true, resolves to put her away in the most private manner he could, rather than to expose her to a public shame, or to be made a public example. Their being betrothed was a thing publicly taken notice of, and he could not put her away so privately but there must be witnesses of it; the meaning therefore must be, as privately as the nature of the thing would bear. Joseph in this case had the choice of three things: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. He might, notwithstanding this, have taken her to his house as his wife, for the law of divorce, or putting away, was but a law giving a liberty in case of a discerned uncleanness to put away the wife, it did not lay any under an obligation so to do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. He might give her a bill of divorce, and leave her with her friends. Now those skilled in the Jewish writings tell us this might be done, either more privately before two or three witnesses, putting a writing of that import into her bosom; or more openly and publicly before the magistrate. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. He might, according to the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm" title="If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;">Deu 22:23</a>,24</span>, &c., have brought her forth to be examined, whether she had only suffered a rape, or had herself consented. If it was done with her consent, she was by the law to be stoned. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Of these Joseph, in his first thoughts upon the matter, and before he rightly did understand the thing, chooseth the second and the milder part, and resolves to put her away, but in the most private manner the law would in that case allow him. He did this (saith the evangelist) because he was <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a just man, </span> where the term dikaiov signifieth equitable, in opposition to severity and rigour; nor ought any to say Joseph in this showed himself an unjust man, because by the law she ought to have been stoned to death; for that is a mistake. Supposing she had been with child by man, yet if she had been forced the man only was to die, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-25.htm" title="But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with her shall die.">Deu 22:25</a>,26</span>; or she might have been with child before her betrothing, in which case she was only obliged to marry him that had so abused her. A kind and equitable man always presumes the best, especially in a case where life is concerned; besides that, no doubt Mary had by this time told Joseph the truth, and what the angel had said to her, to which (it being so incredible a thing as not to be believed but upon a Divine revelation) though Joseph was not obliged, having as yet no such revelation, to give a present easy faith, yet he might reasonably give so much credit as to resolve upon the mildest course he could take, though he was willing also to avoid the blot upon himself by taking her to him for his wife according to his contract. God will not leave so good a man long unresolved what to do. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Joseph her husband,....

The Greek word signifies to punish by way of example to others, to deter them from sinning; and with the ancients it (c) denoted the greatest and severest punishment. Here it means either bringing her before the civil magistrate, in order to her being punished according to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm">Deuteronomy 22:23</a> which requires the person to be brought out to the gate of the city and stoned with stones, which was making a public example indeed; or divorcing her in a very public manner, and thereby expose her to open shame and disgrace.

For <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, like <span class="greekheb">צַדַּיק</span>, means generally, he who is as he ought to be (Hermann, ad Soph. Ajac. 543; Kühner, ad Xen. Memor. iv. 4. 5; Gesen. Thes. III. p. 1151); therefore rightly constituted, and, in a narrower sense, just, but never kind, although kindness, compassion, and the like may be in given cases the concrete form in which the <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> expresses itself. Here, according to the context, it denotes the man who acts in a strictly legal manner. <span class="greekheb">Δίκαιος</span> down to <span class="greekheb">δειγματίσαι</span> contains two concurring motives. Joseph was an upright man according to the law, and could not therefore make up his mind to retain Mary, as she was pregnant without him; at the same time he could not bring himself to abandon her publicly; he therefore resolved to adopt the middle way, and dismiss her secretly. Observe the emphasis of <span class="greekheb">λάθρα</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δειγματίσαι</span>] to expose; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>. Here the meaning is: to expose to public shame. This, however, does not refer to the punishment of stoning (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-23.htm" title="If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed to an husband, and a man find her in the city, and lie with her;">Deuteronomy 22:23</a>), which was to be inflicted; nor to a judicial accusation generally (the common view), because <span class="greekheb">δειγματίσαι</span> must mean a kind of dismissal opposed to that denoted by <span class="greekheb">λάθρα</span>; comp. de Wette. Therefore: he did not wish to compromise her, which would have been the result had he given her a letter of divorce, and thus dismissed her <span class="greekheb">φανερῶς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">λάθρα</span>] secretly, in private, i.e. by means of a secret, private interview, without a letter of divorce. This would, indeed, have been in opposition to the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, which applied also to betrothed persons (Maimonides, Tract. <span class="greekheb">אישוֹת</span>, c. 1; Wetstein in loc.; Philo, de leg. spec. p. 788); but he saw himself liable to a collision between the two cases,—of either, in these circumstances, retaining the bride, or of exposing her to public censure by a formal dismissal; and from this no more legal way of escape presented itself than that on which he might with the more propriety lay hold, that the law itself in Deut. l.c. speaks only of married persons, not of betrothed. De Wette thinks, indeed, of dismissal by a letter of divorcement, but under arrangements providing for secrecy. But the letter of divorce of itself, as it was a public document (see Saalschütz, M. R. p. 800 ff.; Ewald, Alterth. p. 272 [E.

This is meant by “<span class="ital">putting her away privily</span>,” the more merciful course which Joseph resolved to adopt.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-19.htm" title="Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to make her a public example, was minded to put her away privately.">Matthew 1:19</a>. <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, <span class="ital">just</span>[54]) It is disputed in what sense this epithet is applied to Joseph. The thing is clear. Joseph wished to put away Mary, and he also wished to put her away privately. The Evangelist indicates the cause of both wishes. Why did he wish to do it <span class="ital">privately?</span> Because he was unwilling to publish the matter, and exact the penalty which the law permitted in the case of women guilty, or suspected, of adultery, and thus to make an example of one, whose sanctity he had in other respects so greatly revered. But why did he wish to put her away at all? We learn from the context. Because he was <span class="ital">just</span> (<span class="ital">justus</span>), and did not think it reputable (<span class="ital">honestum</span>) to retain as his wife one who appeared to have broken her conjugal faith. His thoughts were many and conflicting; his mind was in doubt. St Matthew expresses this with great beauty, by a phraseology somewhat ambiguous in this its brevity: for Greek participles may be resolved into the corresponding verbs with the conjunctions <span class="ital">although, because</span>, or <span class="ital">since</span>: [and <span class="greekheb">μὴ θέλων</span>, therefore, may be rendered either <span class="ital">although he was unwilling, because he was unwilling</span>, or <span class="ital">since he did not wish</span>].

This clause has been taken in the opposite sense equivalent to "and therefore not wishing," because the spirit of the Law, which he had learned to understand, was in reality against all unnecessary harshness. The negative used (if it can be at all insisted upon; cf.

Adopting the most private form of legal divorce, and handing the letter to her privately in presence of only two witnesses, to whom he need not communicate his reasons (cf. Edersheim, 'Life,' 1:154).

The original words are often used synonymously in eases where no distinction is emphasized; but their use in other eases reveals a radical and recognized difference. An interchange is inadmissible when the greater force of the expression requires &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;. For instance, &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, would be entirely inappropriate at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/8-3.htm">Matthew 8:3</a>, "I will, be thou cleansed;" or at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-15.htm">Romans 7:15</a>.<p>The distinction, which is abundantly illustrated in Homer, is substantially maintained by the classical writers throughout, and in the New Testament.<p>&#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; is the stronger word, and expresses a purpose or determination or decree, the execution of which is, or is believed to be, in the power of him who wills. &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; expresses wish, inclination, or disposition, whether one desires to do a thing himself or wants some one else to do it. &#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, therefore, denotes the active resolution, the will urging on to action. &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is to have a mind, to desire, sometimes a little stronger, running into the sense of purpose. &#x398;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; indicates the impulse of the will; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, its tendency. &#x392;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; can always be rendered by &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;, but &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; cannot always be expressed by &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;.<p>Thus, Agamemnon says, "I would not (&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3ba; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;) receive the ransom for the maid (i.e., I refused to receive), because I greatly desire (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;) to have her at home" (Homer, "II.," 1:112). So Demosthenes: "It is fitting that you should be willing (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;) to listen to those who wish (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) to advise" ("Olynth.," 1:1). That is to say, It is in your power to determine whether or not you will listen to those who desire to advise you, but whose power to do so depends on your consent. Again: "If the gods will it (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;) and you wish it (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;)" (Demosth., "Olynth.," 2:20). <p>In the New Testament, as observed above, though the words are often interchanged, the same distinction is recognized. Thus, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/2-18.htm">Matthew 2:18</a>, "Rachael would not (&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;) be comforted;" obstinately and positively refused. Joseph, having the right and power under the (assumed) circumstances to make Mary a public example, resolved (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;) to spare her this exposure. Then the question arose - What should he do? On this he thought, and, having thought (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;), his mind inclined (tendency), he was minded (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;) to put her away secretly.<p>Some instances of the interchanged use of the two words are the following: <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-15.htm">Mark 15:15</a>, "Pilate willing" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-20.htm">Luke 23:20</a>, "Pilate willing" (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;). <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-43.htm">Acts 27:43</a>, "The centurion willing" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;); <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-17.htm">Matthew 27:17</a>, "Whom will ye that I release" (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;); so <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-21.htm">Matthew 27:21</a>. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/18-39.htm">John 18:39</a>, "Will ye that I release" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;); <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/14-5.htm">Matthew 14:5</a>, "When he would have put him to death" (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;). <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-48.htm">Mark 6:48</a>, "He would have passed by them" (&#x3b7;&#787;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;); <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/19-30.htm">Acts 19:30</a>, "Paul would have entered" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-27.htm">Acts 18:27</a>, "He was disposed to pass" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;). <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>, "I will that thou affirm" (&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;). <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-25.htm">Mark 6:25</a>, "I will that thou give me" (&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;), etc., etc.<p>In the New Testament &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9; occurs in the following senses:<p>1. A decree or determination of the will. (a) Of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-7.htm">Matthew 12:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-18.htm">Romans 9:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm">Acts 18:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-19.htm">1 Corinthians 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-18.htm">1 Corinthians 12:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-38.htm">1 Corinthians 15:38</a>).

(c) Of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/25-9.htm">Acts 25:9</a>).

A wish or desire. Very many of the passages, however, which are cited under this head (as by Grimm) may fairly be interpreted as implying something stronger than a wish; notably <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/14-36.htm">Mark 14:36</a>, of Christ in Gethsemane.

It is the purpose of the life. <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-15.htm">Matthew 27:15</a>, It was given to the Jews to decide what prisoner should be released. <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-62.htm">Luke 1:62</a>, The name of the infant John was referred to Zacharias' decision. <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-24.htm">John 17:24</a>, Surely Christ does more than desire that those whom the Father has given him shall be with him. <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-54.htm">Luke 9:54</a>, It is for Jesus to command fire upon the Samaritan villages if he so wills.
