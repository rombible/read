They imply the formal ratification of the betrothal before witnesses; the benediction by a priest; the marriage-feast; the removal from the house that had hitherto been her home to that of Joseph. They imply also that what had seemed evidence of guilt among the neighbours of that home, brought with it to Joseph’s mind no ground for blame. To them, if they were not told the history, and it is not probable that they were, it must have been deemed an act of exceptional mercy and forbearance. The reverence implied in what the next verse records must have roused their wonder.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/1-24.htm" title="Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:...">Matthew 1:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Joseph did as the angel had bidden him </span>— This sudden change of his resolution, shows his great faith and ready obedience to God. When God speaks to our hearts, we speedily and cheerfully do what before we not only scrupled, but thought, perhaps, most inconvenient and unpleasing, and even contrary to the dictates of reason. <span class="ital">And took unto him his wife </span>— That is, he took her home to his house. Nevertheless, in expectation of this wonderful event, and out of reverence to this sacred birth, he <span class="ital">knew her not </span>as his wife, though she dwelt under his roof; but she continued a pure virgin till at least Jesus was born. “On what terms they afterward lived,” says an eminent divine, “is of so little importance to us, that one cannot but wonder it should have been the subject of so much debate. It is sufficient for us to know that she was a <span class="ital">virgin, </span>not only at the time of Christ’s conception, but at his birth, as the prophecy foretold she should be. The evangelist, therefore, wisely contented himself with recording this, without affirming any thing further, either way, on this delicate subject.” We must observe, however, that the expression, <span class="ital">Till she had brought forth her firstborn son, </span>does not necessarily imply that he knew her afterward, any more than the Lord’s words to Jacob, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-15.htm" title="And, behold, I am with you, and will keep you in all places where you go, and will bring you again into this land; for I will not leave you, until I have done that which I have spoken to you of.">Genesis 28:15</a>, <span class="ital">I will not leave thee till I have done all that which I have spoken to thee of, </span>imply that the Lord left Jacob after he had fulfilled his promises to him; or what is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-23.htm" title="Therefore Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.">2 Samuel 6:23</a>, of <span class="ital">Michal, </span>Saul’s daughter, that <span class="ital">she had no child till the day of her death, </span>that she bore a child or children afterward; nor will the expression, <span class="ital">her firstborn son, </span>prove that she had afterward any more children, being in Scripture applied continually to the person that first <span class="ital">opened the womb, </span>as the phrase, is, whether there were any more children or not. Indeed, the Greek here, <span class="greekheb">τον υιον αυτης</span>, <span class="greekheb">τον πρωτοτοκον</span>, is literally, <span class="ital">her son, the firstborn, </span>or <span class="ital">that firstborn, </span>viz., that person eminent and dear to God above others that were the firstborn, whom all the firstborn in the Old Testament prefigured, whom the angels adore, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>, and in whom those that believe become the firstborn, and the first fruits of God’s creatures. Nevertheless, when it is considered what is the great end of marriage, that Joseph took Mary to wife by the command of God himself, and that his law not only <span class="ital">permits, </span>but even <span class="ital">enjoins </span>husbands to perform the marriage duty, it is, as Dr. Whitby observes, “not easy to be conceived, that he should live twelve years with her he loved so well, and all that time deny that duty which was not to be diminished when the wife was less beloved:” especially as no just reason whatever can be assigned for such conduct. Be this as it may, we may safely conclude with St. Basil, an ancient father of the Church, that till she had brought forth her firstborn her virginity was necessary: “but what she was afterward let us leave undiscussed, as being of small concern to the mystery.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-25 Let us look to the circumstances under which the Son of God entered into this lower world, till we learn to despise the vain honours of this world, when compared with piety and holiness. The mystery of Christ's becoming man is to be adored, not curiously inquired into. It was so ordered that Christ should partake of our nature, yet that he should be pure from the defilement of original sin, which has been communicated to all the race of Adam. Observe, it is the thoughtful, not the unthinking, whom God will guide. God's time to come with instruction to his people, is when they are at a loss. Divine comforts most delight the soul when under the pressure of perplexed thoughts. Joseph is told that Mary should bring forth the Saviour of the world. He was to call his name Jesus, a Saviour. Jesus is the same name with Joshua. And the reason of that name is clear, for those whom Christ saves, he saves from their sins; from the guilt of sin by the merit of his death, and from the power of sin by the Spirit of his grace. In saving them from sin, he saves them from wrath and the curse, and all misery, here and hereafter. Christ came to save his people, not in their sins, but from their sins; and so to redeem them from among men, to himself, who is separate from sinners. Joseph did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, speedily, without delay, and cheerfully, without dispute. By applying the general rules of the written word, we should in all the steps of our lives, particularly the great turns of them, take direction from God, and we shall find this safe and comfortable.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Being raised from sleep - Having fully awoke.<p>Did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him - That is, he took Mary to wife.
