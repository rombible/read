This will, it is believed, be best dealt with in a short <span class= "ital">Excursus</span> in the Notes on that Gospel. Here it may be sufficient to note that the difference between the two is, at least, strong presumptive evidence that neither of the two Evangelists had seen the record of the other. It is otherwise hardly conceivable that the element of difficulty which these differences involve should have been introduced by one or the other without a word of explanation. Each, it may be presumed, copied a document which he found, and the two documents were drawn up on a different plan as to the ideas of succession recognised in each of them.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a></span>. <span class="ital">So all the generations, </span>&c. — “Matthew, designing to show that Jesus was the Messiah, began his genealogy at Abraham, to whom the promise was originally made, that <span class="ital">in his seed all the families of the earth should be blessed. </span>But the succession of Christ’s ancestors, from Abraham downward, naturally resolved itself into three classes; viz., first of private persons from Abraham to David; next of kings from David to Jehoiakim; and then of private persons from the Babylonish captivity, when an end was put to the royal dignity of our Lord’s progenitors.” For Jehoiachin, the son of Jehoiakim, was reduced to the condition of a private person, being made a captive; “and as for Salathiel and Zerubbabel, notwithstanding they had the supreme command, after their return from the captivity, they were not vested either with the titles or powers of princes, being only lieutenants of the kings of Persia. Wherefore the evangelist, thus invited by his subject, fitly distributes Christ’s ancestors into three classes, the first and last of which consisting exactly of fourteen successions, he mentions only fourteen in the middle class, though in reality it contained three more, viz. Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah. But omissions of this kind are not uncommon in the Jewish genealogies. For example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/7-3.htm" title="The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,">Ezra 7:3</a>, Azariah is called the son of Meraioth, although it is evident, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/6-7.htm" title="Meraioth begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,...">1 Chronicles 6:7-9</a>, that there were six descendants between them.” — Macknight. We may observe also, that God’s chosen people, in each of these several intervals, were under a different kind of government, and the end of each interval produced a great alteration in their state. In the first, they were under patriarchs, prophets, and judges; in the second, under kings; and in the third, under the Asmonæan priests and generals. The first fourteen generations brought their state to dignity and glory in the kingdom of David; the second, to disgrace and misery in the captivity of Babylon; and the third, to honour and glory again in the kingdom of Christ. The first begins with Abraham, who received the promise, and ends in David, to whom it was renewed and revealed more fully; the second begins with the building of the temple, and ends with its destruction; the third begins with their temporal captivity in Babylon, and ends with their spiritual deliverance by Christ. “When we survey such a series of generations,” says Dr. Doddridge, “it is obvious to reflect, how, <span class="ital">like the leaves of a tree, one passeth away, and another cometh; </span>yet <span class="ital">the earth still abideth. </span>And with it, the goodness of the Lord, which runs on from generation to generation, the common hope of parents and children. Of those who formerly lived upon earth, and perhaps made the most conspicuous figure among the children of men, how many are there whose names are perished with them! and how many of whom only the names are remaining! Thus are <span class="ital">we </span>likewise passing away! And thus shall we shortly be forgotten! Happy, if, while we are forgotten by men, we are remembered by God, and our <span class="ital">names </span>are found <span class="ital">written in the book of life! </span>There will they make a much brighter appearance than in the records of fame, or than they would do even in such a catalogue as this of those who were related to Christ <span class="ital">according to the flesh; </span>whose memory is here preserved, when that of many, who were once the wonder and terror of the mighty in the land of the living, is lost in perpetual oblivion.” <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-17 Concerning this genealogy of our Saviour, observe the chief intention. It is not a needless genealogy. It is not a vain-glorious one, as those of great men often are. It proves that our Lord Jesus is of the nation and family out of which the Messiah was to arise. The promise of the blessing was made to Abraham and his seed; of the dominion, to David and his seed. It was promised to Abraham that Christ should descend from him, Ge 12:3; 22:18; and to David that he should descend from him, 2Sa 7:12; Ps 89:3, &c.; 132:11; and, therefore, unless Jesus is a son of David, and a son of Abraham, he is not the Messiah. Now this is here proved from well-known records. When the Son of God was pleased to take our nature, he came near to us, in our fallen, wretched condition; but he was perfectly free from sin: and while we read the names in his genealogy, we should not forget how low the Lord of glory stooped to save the human race.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So all the generations ... - This division of the names in the genealogical tables was doubtless adopted for the purpose of aiding the memory. It was common among the Jews; and other similar instances are preserved. The Jews were destitute of books besides the Old Testament, and they had but few copies of that among them, and those chiefly in their synagogues. They would therefore naturally devise plans to keep up the remembrance of the principal facts in their history. One method of doing this was to divide the tables of genealogy into portions of equal length, to be committed to memory. This greatly facilitated the remembrance of the names. A man who wished to commit to memory the names of a regiment of soldiers would naturally divide it into companies and platoons, and this would greatly facilitate his work. This was doubtless the reason in the case before us. And, though it is not strictly accurate, yet it was the Jewish way of keeping their records, and answered their purpose. There were three leading persons and events that nearly, or quite, divided their history into equal portions: Abraham, David, and the Babylonian captivity. From one to the other was about 14 generations, and by omitting a few names it was sufficiently accurate to be made a general guide or directory in recalling the principal events in their history.<p>In counting these divisions, however, it will be seen that there is some difficulty in making out the number 14 in each division. This may be explained in the following manner: In the first division, Abraham is the first and David the last, making 14 altogether. In the second series, David would naturally be placed first, and the 14 was completed in Josiah, about the time of the captivity, as sufficiently near for the purpose of convenient computation, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/35.htm">2 Chronicles 35</a>. In the third division Josiah would naturally be placed first, and the number was completed in Joseph; so that David and Josiah would be reckoned twice. This may be shown by the following table of the names:<p>FirstDivision SecondDivision ThirdDivision  Abraham David Josias  Isaac Solomon Jechonias  Jacob Roboam Salathiel  Judas Abia Zorobabel  Phares Asa Abiud  Esrom Josaphat Eliakim  Aram Joram Azor  Aminadab Ozias Sadoc  Naasson Joatham Achim  Salmon Achaz Eliud  Boaz Ezekias Eleazar  Obed Manasses Matthan  Jesse Amon Jacob  David Josias Joseph  14 14 14  <p>Carrying away into Babylon - This refers to the captivity of Jerusalem, and the removal of the Jews to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar, 588 years before Christ. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36.htm">2 Chronicles 36</a>. Josiah was king when these calamities began to come upon the Jews, but the exact time of the 70 years of captivity did not commence until the 11th year of Zedekiah's reign, or 32 years after the death of Josiah. Babylon was situated on the Euphrates, and was encompassed with walls which were about 60 miles in circuit, 87 feet broad, and 350 feet high, and the city was entered by 100 brass gates - 25 on each side. It was the capital of a vast empire, and the Jews remained there for 70 years. See Barnes' notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13.htm">Isaiah 13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>17. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away&#8212;or migration.<p>into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon&#8212;the migration of Babylon.<p>unto Christ are fourteen generations&#8212;that is, the whole may be conveniently divided into three fourteens, each embracing one marked era, and each ending with a notable event, in the Israelitish annals. Such artificial aids to memory were familiar to the Jews, and much larger gaps than those here are found in some of the Old Testament genealogies. In Ezr 7:1-5 no fewer than six generations of the priesthood are omitted, as will appear by comparing it with 1Ch 6:3-15. It will be observed that the last of the three divisions of fourteen appears to contain only thirteen distinct names, including Jesus as the last. Lange thinks that this was meant as a tacit hint that Mary was to be supplied, as the thirteenth link of the last chain, as it is impossible to conceive that the Evangelist could have made any mistake in the matter. But there is a simpler way of accounting for it. As the Evangelist himself (Mt 1:17) reckons David twice&#8212;as the last of the first fourteen and the first of the second&#8212;so, if we reckon the second fourteen to end with Josiah, who was coeval with the "carrying away into captivity" (Mt 1:11), and third to begin with Jeconiah, it will be found that the last division, as well as the other two, embraces fourteen names, including that of our Lord.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The evangelist, for reasons which we cannot fathom, reduces our Saviour’s progenitors to <span class="ital">fourteen</span> in each period of the Jewish state; and in the first period, determining with David, there were no more. In the second, he leaveth out three kings descended from the daughter of Ahab. In the third, which was from the captivity to Christ, there were doubtless more; Luke reckoneth up twenty-four, (taking in Christ for one), and agreeth in very few with Matthew, who was forced to leave out some to keep to this number of fourteen. Nor doth Matthew speak any thing false, or contradictious to Luke, in saying there were fourteen though there were more. Besides, there might be many more progenitors of Mary than of Joseph, whose pedigree Matthew deriveth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So all the generations from Abraham,.... The Evangelist having traced the genealogy of Christ from Abraham, which he divides into "three" parts, because of the threefold state of the Jews, "first" under Patriarchs, Prophets, and Judges, "next" under Kings, and "then" under Princes and Priests, gives the sum of each part under its distinct head; "so all the generations", that is, the degrees of generation, or the persons generated from Abraham to David, both being included, "are fourteen generations"; as there were, and no more, and are as follow, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Phares, Esrom, Aram, Amminadab, Naasson, Salmon, Boaz, Obed, Jesse, David. <p>And from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations. Here David who closed the first division must be excluded this, and it must be observed, that the Evangelist does not say as before, that "all" the generations from David to the captivity were fourteen, for there were seventeen, three kings being omitted by him at once; but, the generations he thought fit to mention, in order to reduce them to a like number as before, and which were sufficient for his purpose, were fourteen; and may be reckoned in this order, Solomon, Roboam, Abia, Asa, Josaphat, Joram, Ozias, Joatham, Achaz, Ezekias, Manasses, Amon, Josias, Jechonias, or Jehoiachin. <p>And from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations. This must be understood as before; for there might be more generations in this interval, but these were enough to answer the design of the Evangelist; and which he thought proper to mention, and may be numbered in this manner; Jechonias, or Jehoiachin, Salathiel, Zorobabel, Abiud, Ehakim, Azor, Sadoc, Achim, Eliud, Eleazar, Matthan, Jacob, Joseph, Christ. This way of reckoning by generations was used by other nations as well as the Jews (u), particularly the Grecians; so (w) Pausanias says, <p>"From Tharypus to Pyrrhus the son of Achilles,    , were fifteen generations of men.'' <p>And Herodotus (x) speaking of those who had reigned in Babylon, says, among them were two women, one whose name was Semiramis, who reigned before the other , five generations; many other instances of the like kind might be given. <p>(u) Vid.

According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-11.htm" title="And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:">Matthew 1:11</a>, Josiah begat Jechoniah at the time of the migration to Babylon; consequently Jechoniah must <span class="ital">be included</span> in the <span class="ital">terminus ad quem</span>, which is designated by <span class="greekheb">ἕως τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>. The same Jechoniah, however, must just as necessarily again begin the third division, as the same begins with <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος</span>. Jechoniah, however, who was himself <span class="ital">begotten</span> at the time of the migration, did not become <span class="ital">a father</span> until after the migration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a>), so that he therefore belonged as <span class="ital">begotten</span> to the period <span class="greekheb">ἕως τῆς μετοικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Βαβυλ</span>., but as a <span class="ital">father</span> to the period <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ τῆς μετοικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Βαβυλ</span>., standing in his relation to the epoch of the <span class="greekheb">μετοικεσία</span> as a <span class="ital">twofold person</span>. It is not so with <span class="ital">David</span>, as the latter, like every other except Jechoniah, is only named, but not brought into connection with an epoch-making event in the history, in relation to which he might appear as son and father in a twofold personality. He has therefore no right to be counted twice. According to this view, the three tesseradecades are to be thus divided,[355]—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[355] Comp.

If Jesus were not included in the enumeration, we should then have a genealogy of <span class="ital">Joseph</span>, and the final terminus must have been said to be <span class="greekheb">ἕως Ἰωσήφ</span>. Certainly, according to our Gospel, no proper <span class="greekheb">γενεά</span> existed between Joseph and Jesus, a circumstance which in reality takes away from the entire genealogical tree its character as a genealogy of <span class="ital">Jesus</span> in the proper sense. The genealogist himself, however, guards so definitely against every misinterpretation by the words <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἄνδρα Μαρίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἧς ἐγεννήθη Ἰησοῦς</span>, that we distinctly see that he means to carry the descent of Jesus <span class="ital">beyond Joseph</span> back to David and Abraham, only in so far as Joseph, being <span class="ital">husband of the mother of Jesus</span>, was His father, merely putatively so indeed, but by the marriage his father in the eye of the law, although not his <span class="ital">real parent</span>. After all this, we are neither, with Olearius, Bengel, Fritzsche, de Wette (who is followed by Strauss, 4th ed., I. p. 139), Delitzsch, Bleek, and others, to divide thus: (1) Abraham to David, (2) David to Josiah, (3) Jechoniah to Christ; nor, with Storr (<span class="ital">Diss. in libror. hist. N. T. loca</span>, p. 1 ff.), Rosenmüller, Kuinoel, Olshausen: (1) Abraham to David, (2) David to Josiah, (3) Josiah to Joseph; nor are we to say, with Paulus, that among the unknown links, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/1-13.htm" title="And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;...">Matthew 1:13-16</a>, one has fallen out owing to the copyists; nor, with Jerome, Gusset, Wolf, Gratz, to make Jechoniah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-11.htm" title="And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:">Matthew 1:11</a> into Joiakim, by the insertion of which Ewald completes (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-11.htm" title="And Josias begat Jechonias and his brothers, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:">Matthew 1:11</a>) the second tesseradecade, without counting David twice; nor, with Ebrard, Lange, Krafft, to insert <span class="ital">Mary</span> as an intermediate link between Joseph and Jesus, by whose marriage with Joseph, Jesus became heir to the theocratic throne. The latter is erroneous on this account, that it contradicts the text, which does not speak of succession to the theocratic throne, but of <span class="greekheb">γενεαί</span>, the condition of which is <span class="greekheb">ἐγέννησε</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐγεννήθη</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We must assume that the <span class="ital">reason for the division</span> into three tesseradecades was not merely to <span class="ital">aid the memory</span> (Michaelis, Eichhorn, Kuinoel, Fritzsche), which is not sufficient to explain the emphatic and solemn prominence given to the equal number of links in the three periods, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>; nor even the <span class="ital">Cabbalistic number of the name David</span> (<span class="greekheb">דוד</span>, i.e. 14; so Surenhusius, Ammon, Leben Jesu, I. p. 173), as it is not David, but Jesus, that is in question; nor a reminiscence of the forty-two encampments in the wilderness (Origen, Luther, Gfrörer, Philo, II. p. 429, after Numbers 33), which would be quite arbitrary and foreign to the subject; nor a requirement to the reader to seek out the theocratic references concealed in the genealogy (Ebrard), in doing which Matthew would, without any reason, have proposed the proper design of his genealogical tree as a mere riddle, and by his use of <span class="greekheb">ἐγέννησε</span> would have made the solution itself impossible: but that precisely from Abraham to David fourteen links appeared, which led the author to find fourteen links for the two other periods also, in which, according to Jewish idiosyncrasy, he saw something special, which contained a mystic allusion to the sytematic course of divine leading in the Messiah’s genealogy, where perhaps also the attraction of holiness in the number seven (the double of which was yielded by the first period) came into play. Comp. Synops. Soh. p. 132. 18 : “Ab Abrahamo usque ad Salom. quindecim sunt generationes, atque tunc luna fuit in plenilunio, a Salomone usque ad Zedekiam iterum sunt quindecim generationes, et tunc luna defecit, et Zedekiae effossi sunt oculi.” See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/5-3.htm" title="And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name Seth:">Genesis 5:3</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-10.htm" title="These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:">Genesis 11:10</a> ff., where, from Adam to Noah, and from Noah to Abraham, ten links in each case are counted. It is altogether arbitrary, however, because there is no allusion to it in Matthew, when Delitzsch (in Rudelbach and Guericke’s Zeitschrift, 1850, p. 587 ff.) explains the symmetry of the three tesseradecades from this, that Matthew always makes a generation from Abraham to David amount to eighty years, but each of the following to forty, and consequently has calculated 1120 + 560 + 560 years. To do so is incorrect, because <span class="greekheb">γενεαί</span> receives its designation from <span class="greekheb">ἐγέννησε</span>, it being presupposed that <span class="greekheb">γενεά</span> denotes a generation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK 1.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is clear from <span class="greekheb">πᾶσαι</span> that the evangelist supposed that he had the genealogical tree <span class="ital">complete</span>, and consequently was not aware of the important omissions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Whether <span class="ital">Mary</span> also was descended from David, as Justin, <span class="ital">Dial. c.

T. is entirely wanting, as the genealogical tree in Luke is not that of Mary. Nor can a conclusion be drawn to that effect, as is done by the Greek Fathers, from the Davidic descent of Joseph; for even if Mary had been an heiress, which, however, cannot at all be established (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-5.htm" title="To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child.">Luke 2:5</a>), this would be quite a matter of indifference so far as her descent is concerned, since the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/36-6.htm" title="This is the thing which the LORD does command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry.">Numbers 36:6</a> only forbade such daughters to marry into another <span class="ital">tribe</span>, Ewald, <span class="ital">Alterth</span>. p. 239 f.

Schleiermacher, Strauss, B.

Add to this that, as clearly appears from Luke, <span class="ital">various</span> genealogical trees must have been in existence, at the foundation of which, however, had originally[357] lain the view of a natural <span class="greekheb">γένεσις</span> of Jesus, although the expression of such a view had already disappeared from them, so that <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm" title="And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.">Matthew 1:16</a> no longer ran <span class="greekheb">Ἰωσὴφ δὲ ἐγέννησεν Ἰησοῦν</span>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm" title="And Jesus himself began to be about thirty years of age, being (as was supposed) the son of Joseph, which was the son of Heli,">Luke 3:23</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἐνομίζετο</span> was already interpolated. Such anti-Ebionitic alterations in the last link of the current genealogical registers of Jesus are not to be ascribed, first, to the evangelists themselves (Strauss, Schenkel); nor is the alteration in question which occurs in Matthew to be derived from a supposed redactor who dealt freely with a fundamental gospel document of a Judaistic kind (Hilgenfeld). The expression <span class="greekheb">ὁ λεγόμενος Χριστύς</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-16.htm" title="And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.">Matthew 1:16</a> rather betrays that the genealogical written source passed over into the Gospel in the shape in which it already existed; neither the author nor an editor would have written <span class="greekheb">ὁ λεγόμενος</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm" title="The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.">Matthew 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-18.htm" title="Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.">Matthew 1:18</a>), or, had they made an alteration in <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>. The evangelist pauses to point out the structure of his genealogy: three parts with fourteen members each; symmetrical, memorable; <span class="greekheb">πᾶσαι</span> does not imply, as Meyer and Weiss think, that in the opinion of the evangelist no links are omitted. He speaks simply of what lies under the eye. There they are, fourteen in each, count and satisfy yourself. But the counting turns out not to be so easy, and has given rise to great divergence of opinion. The division naturally suggested by the words of the text is: from Abraham to David, terminating first series, 14; from David, heading second series, to the captivity as limit, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to Josiah, 14; from the captivity represented by Jeconiah to <span class="ital">Christ</span>, included as final term, 14. So Bengel and De Wette. If objection be taken to counting David twice, the brethren of Jeconiah, that is, his uncles, may be taken as representing the concluding term of series 2, and Jeconiah himself as the first member of series 3 (Weiss-Meyer). The identical number in the three parts is of no importance in itself. It is a numerical symbol uniting three periods, and suggesting comparison in other respects, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, as to different forms of government—judges, kings, priests (Euthy. Zig.), theocracy, monarchy, hierarchy (Schanz), all summed up in Christ; or as to Israel’s fortunes: growth, decline, ruin—redemption urgently needed.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">17</span>. This division into three sets, each containing fourteen steps of descent, is an instance of a practice familiar to readers of Jewish antiquities. Lightfoot says, “They do so very much delight in such kind of concents, that they oftentimes screw up the strings beyond the due measure and stretch them till they crack.” Such a system necessitates the omission of steps in the descent: see notes <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-8.htm" title="And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;">Matthew 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-13.htm" title="And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;">Matthew 1:13</a></span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-17.htm" title="So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ are fourteen generations.">Matthew 1:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πᾶσαι οὖν αἱ γενεαὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">So all the generations</span>, etc.) An important summing up (<span class="ital">ingens symperasma</span>),[26] the force of which we exhibit, by the following positions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] See Appendix on the figure <span class="ital">Symperasma</span>.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I. <span class="ital">St Matthew introduced this clause with the most deliberate design</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Messiah was really descended from David through Nathan: the genealogy, however, in Matthew, descends from David through Solomon to Joseph. Therefore, those who already knew that Jesus was not the Son of Joseph, paid little heed to Joseph’s pedigree; St Matthew, therefore, traces this genealogy in such a manner as to be serviceable to all who either believed that Jesus was the Son of Mary, but not of Joseph, or thought that He was the Son of Joseph also, and so to lead both classes to <span class="ital">Christ, the Son of David</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>II. <span class="ital">St Matthew makes three fourteens</span>.

Yet, so far from counting the steps in each period, he does not divide his genealogy into periods at all: St Matthew, however, distinguishes three periods,—the first from Abraham to David, the second from David to the captivity, the third from the captivity to Christ; and in each of these periods, as we shall presently see, he mentions fourteen steps.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IV. <span class="ital">St Matthew reduces each period to fourteen generations</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Matthew does not mention all the ancestors of Joseph who occur in the direct line, and yet he reduces those whom he does mention to a set number. Some seek here a division into <span class="ital">sevens</span>; the Evangelist, however, does not mention sevens, but fourteens. Again, he does not bring these fourteens together into a sum total, for he does not say, that they amount in all to 40, 41, or 42: nor is it our business to do so. As in the reigns of the kings of Israel, the last year of the preceding is frequently reckoned as the first of the succeeding sovereign, so must we admit that St Matthew has acted on the same principle, since the fact itself leaves no doubt of the case. Thus David undoubtedly is both the last of the first fourteen, and the first of the second fourteen. He is reckoned in the first; for it would otherwise comprise only thirteen generations. He is reckoned in the second, because as the first begins <span class="ital">inclusively</span> from Abraham, and the third <span class="ital">inclusively</span> from Jechoniah, so must the second begin <span class="ital">inclusively</span> from David. Jechoniah, however, is not reckoned in the same manner as the last of the second fourteen, because the fourteen generations, which commence with David, are counted not to Jechoniah, but to the Babylonian captivity. Vallesius[27] (p. 454) thinks Jechoniah, as it were, a double person; you might assert that with greater correctness of David.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] Vallesius, or Vallès, Francis, a native of Spain, physician to Philip II. He wrote a treatise, “De iis quæ scripta sunt physice in libris sacris, sive de sacrâ philosophiâ.”—(I. B.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>V. <span class="ital">In each case, his object was to prove that Jesus was truly called, and was, the Christ.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He proceeds in a marked manner from the name <span class="ital">Jesus</span> to the surname <span class="ital">Christ</span>, in verses 16, 17, 18; and he marks the <span class="ital">dissimilarity</span> in the character of the periods, and the <span class="ital">equality</span> in the number of the generations. That dissimilarity, and that equality, whether taken apart or together, tend to the one object of proving <span class="ital">Jesus</span> to be the <span class="ital">Christ</span>, as we shall immediately perceive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VI. <span class="ital">The three periods are dissimilar to each other</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If St Matthew had merely intended to compose a genealogy, he might have omitted all this <span class="ital">Congeries</span>[28] of names, or at any rate, have confined himself to the mention of proper names, and said, “From Abraham to David,” “from David to Jechoniah,” “from Jechoniah to Jesus.” Instead of so doing, however, after the other matters preceding, he says, “<span class="ital">to the Captivity</span>;” and again, “<span class="ital">From the Captivity</span> to Christ.” The land-mark, limit, standing-point, therefore, of the first period is David, of the second the Captivity, of the third Christ. The first period, then, is that of the Patriarchs; the second, that of the Kings; the third, for the most part, of private individuals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] See Appendix on this figure. The enumeration of the parts of a Whole.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VII. <span class="ital">This dissimilarity strikingly proves that Jesus is the Christ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The different heads under which St Matthew reduces the three periods, show, that the time at which <span class="ital">Jesus</span> was born, was the time appointed for the birth of the Christ, and that Jesus Himself was the Christ. The first and the second <span class="ital">fourteen</span> have an illustrious commencement; the third has one, as it were, blind and nameless. Hence is clearly deduced, and brilliantly shines forth, the end and goal of the third, and all the periods, namely, <span class="ital">the</span> CHRIST. The first period is that of promise, for in it Abraham stands first, and David last, to each of whom the promise was given; the second is that of adumbration, by means of the Davidical sovereignty, and the fact that it is considerably shorter than either of the others, furnishes a reasonable ground for expecting that the kingdom of David, as fulfilled in Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-32.htm" title="He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:">Luke 1:32</a>), will be far more glorious hereafter, and more lasting. The third period is that of expectation. The most distinguished personages in the first period are Abraham and David, who stand respectively first and last in it. The most distinguished personage in the second period is the same David, who is now found standing first. The first name which occurs in the third period is that of Jechoniah, so called also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1 Chronicles 3:17</a>, who was <span class="ital">bound</span> with chains, to whom no heir was promised of his throne; nay, further, against whom, as well as against his uncle and father, all other woes were denounced (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-11.htm" title="For thus said the LORD touching Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, which reigned instead of Josiah his father, which went forth out of this place; He shall not return thither any more:">Jeremiah 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-18.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!">Jeremiah 22:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-25.htm" title="And I will give you into the hand of them that seek your life, and into the hand of them whose face you fear, even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.">Jeremiah 22:25</a>), so that, though he was not actually without offspring, yet, as a warning to posterity, he should be written <span class="greekheb">ערירי</span>, childless (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-28.htm" title="Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel wherein is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?">Jeremiah 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Write you this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting on the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah.">Jeremiah 22:30</a>), without, that is to say, an heir to his throne; and it was with reference to these three kings that the earth was invoked thrice, “O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the Lord” (Ibid. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-29.htm" title="O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD.">Jeremiah 22:29</a>). Hence it arises that, when stating the boundary between the second and third fourteens, St Matthew does not name Jechoniah; but, instead of so doing, mentions the Babylonian Captivity. Much additional weight accrues to this argument from the words of Jeremiah; for in the time of Moses, midway between Abraham and David, a covenant was made with the people of Israel, which was abrogated about the time of the captivity of Jechoniah.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-1.htm" title="Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders which were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon;">Jeremiah 29:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:">Jeremiah 31:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-8.htm" title="For finding fault with them, he said, Behold, the days come, said the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:">Hebrews 8:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-13.htm" title="In that he said, A new covenant, he has made the first old. Now that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away.">Hebrews 8:13</a>. In the times of Abraham and David, Christ was promised; after the time of David, the Davidical sovereignty, which was overthrown at the Babylonian Captivity, did not last so long as the preceding period, that, namely, between Abraham and David. Then, indeed, it was that a new covenant was promised, the author and surety whereof should be Christ. The state, therefore, of the Jewish nation after the Captivity, could not but tend to, and end in the Christ. In the Psalms, and other predictions delivered during the time of the Kings, the sacred writers, as the march of prophecy moved onward, generally compared the present with the future; whereas, after the Babylonian Captivity, they contrasted the one with the other, whilst contemplating the future as coming nearer and nearer their own times.[29]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] The original runs thus: “In psalmis et in aliis prophetiis regum tempore latis sermo fere per <span class="ital">comparationcm</span> status præsentis et futuri incedebat: sed post migrationem Babylonis potius per <span class="ital">oppositionem</span> incedit, futura prospiciens subinde propius.”—(I. B.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>VIII. <span class="ital">St Matthew makes the three periods equal with each other</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is evident from his repeating the number FOURTEEN three times with the utmost deliberation.—See Section IV.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>IX. <span class="ital">He makes up both the third and the second Fourteens by omitting several links in the pedigree: in the first, however, he makes no such omission</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the second period, he, after Jehoram, passes over Ahaziah, Joash, and Amaziah, and, after Josiah, he leaves out Jehoiakim: in the third period, after Salathiel, he omits Pedaiah. Nor, indeed, was Zorobabel the immediate father of Abihud; for, whereas his sons are <span class="ital">Mesullam</span> and <span class="ital">Hananias</span>, each of these two names differs from <span class="ital">Abihud</span>. Hiller enumerates <span class="ital">nine</span> links omitted after Zorobabel, and shows that Hodaiah and Abihud are the same individual. The descendants of David from Solomon to Hodaiah are enumerated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm" title="And these were born to him in Jerusalem; Shimea, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon, four, of Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel:">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/3-10.htm" title="And Solomon's son was Rehoboam, Abia his son, Asa his son, Jehoshaphat his son,...">1 Chronicles 3:10-24</a>. Now, since neither the second nor the third <span class="ital">Fourteen</span> consist in themselves of exactly fourteen generations, the first must of necessity have that number: for otherwise the number Fourteen, by which the three periods are arranged and represented as equal, would be without any foundation in fact, and the number <span class="ital">fifteen</span>, or some greater still, would have to be substituted for it. Fourteen generations are clearly enumerated in the Old Testament from Abraham to David.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/1-34.htm" title="And Abraham begat Isaac. The sons of Isaac; Esau and Israel.">1 Chronicles 1:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-1.htm" title="These are the sons of Israel; Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun,">1 Chronicles 2:1</a><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fourteen generations</span>. To make the list more easy to remember, the names were so ordered that there should be the same number in each of the three divisions. Thus a means was afforded of checking the correctness of the enumeration, and the list became a sort of <span class="accented">memoria technica.</span> Unto Christ; better here, <span class="accented">unto the Christ.</span> For now begins the history which tells of this Jesus as the specially Anointed One of God, the true Messiah, of which all the previously anointed messengers had been but types and figures. The history which St. Matthew is about to give demonstrates that in Jesus were fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament which the Jews had constantly referred to the Messiah, for whose appearance the pious in Israel were ever looking. </body></html>
