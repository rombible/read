There is a proneness in all of us to be over-confident. But those fall soonest and foulest, who are the most confident in themselves. Those are least safe, who think themselves most secure. Satan is active to lead such astray; they are most off their guard: God leaves them to themselves, to humble them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But after I am risen ... - This promise was given them to encourage and support them, and also to give them an indication where he might be found.<p>He did not deny that he would first appear to a part of them before he met them all together (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/24-13.htm">Luke 24:13-31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-34.htm">Luke 24:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5</a>), but that he would meet them all in Galilee.

This he says for their comfort, that though he, their shepherd, should be apprehended, condemned, and crucified, should be smitten with death, and be laid in the grave, yet he should rise again; and though they should be scattered abroad, yet should be gathered together again by him, their good shepherd; who would after his resurrection, appear to them, be at the head of them, and go before them, as a shepherd goes before his sheep: for it follows, <p>I will go before you into Galilee; the native place of most, if not all of them. This the women that came to the sepulchre after Christ's resurrection, were bid, both by the angel, and Christ himself, to remind the disciples of, and ordered them to go into Galilee, where they might expect to see him: accordingly they did go thither, and saw and worshipped him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-7.htm">Matthew 28:7</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/26.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-32.htm" title="But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.">Matthew 26:32</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Προειπὼν τὰ λυπηρὰ</span>, <span class="greekheb">προλέγει καὶ τὰ παραμυθούμενα</span>, Euthymius Zigabenus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They were again to gather around Him in Galilee, the native scene of His ministry.

The verb is of pastoral signification, as in the East the shepherd does not drive his sheep, but leads them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-4.htm">John 10:4</a>). The apostles, or many of them, after the Resurrection, returned to their old homes in Galilee, but Christ preceded them, and they found him there before them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-7.htm">Mark 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21.htm">John 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-3.htm">Acts 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>). He again gathered around him his little flock lately scattered. True, he had then already appeared to them at Jerusalem more than once; but this was, as it were, fortuitously and unexpectedly. The meeting in Galilee was by appointment, and of most solemn import, Christ then reuniting the apostolic body, and renewing the apostolic commission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18-20</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I will go before you<p>The thought links itself with what Christ had just said about the shepherd and the sheep.
