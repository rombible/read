They had intended to wait till the feast was over, but the temptation thus offered was too great to be resisted, and they accordingly stepped out of the limits which their caution had suggested, and were content to run the risk even of an “uproar among the people” within the twenty-four hours of the Paschal Feast.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:1-5 Our Lord had often told of his sufferings as at a distance, now he speaks of them as at hand. At the same time the Jewish council consulted how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased God to defeat their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to be sacrificed for us at that very time, and his death and resurrection rendered public.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By subtlety - By guile, deceit, or in some secret manner, so that the people would not know it.<p>Jesus was regarded by the people as a distinguished prophet, and by most of them, probably, as the Messiah; and the Sanhedrin did not dare to take him away openly, lest the people should rise and rescue him.

The Jews had often attempted his life, but he escaped out of their hands; they had sent officers to apprehend him, but to no purpose; they therefore meet and consult together, to form some scheme, and make use of some stratagem, that they might lay hold on him, and keep him; they were for doing this in the most private manner they could: <p>and kill him; not with their own hands, nor privately; but their scheme was to apprehend him privately, by some secret artifice, and then deliver him to the Roman governor; to put him to death according to law, publicly, for crimes they had to charge him with; hereby <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/2-2.htm">Psalm 2:2</a>, had its accomplishment, at least in part. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and kill him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-4.htm" title="And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.">Matthew 26:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> with subjunctive after a verb of effort or plan; in classic Greek oftener <span class="greekheb">ὅπως</span> with future indicative (Burton, § 205).—<span class="greekheb">δόλῳ</span> by, craft, a method characteristic of clerics; <span class="ital">indigna consultatio</span> (Bengel); cowardly and merciless.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty</span>] It was no longer possible (1) to entrap Him by argument (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-46.htm" title="And no man was able to answer him a word, neither dared any man from that day forth ask him any more questions.">Matthew 22:46</a>); (2) to discredit Him with the Roman government (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-22.htm" title="When they had heard these words, they marveled, and left him, and went their way.">Matthew 22:22</a>); or (3) to take Him by force.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-4.htm" title="And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtlety, and kill him.">Matthew 26:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">Δόλῳ</span>, <span class="ital">by craft</span>) An unworthy consultation.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">By subtilty.</span> They had decided to put Jesus to death; the question was how to get possession of his Person when there would be no attempt at a rescue, nor any tumult in his favour.
