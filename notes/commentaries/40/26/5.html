At the same time the Jewish council consulted how they might put him to death secretly. But it pleased God to defeat their intention. Jesus, the true paschal Lamb, was to be sacrificed for us at that very time, and his death and resurrection rendered public.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not on the feast-day - Not during the feast.<p>The feast lasted for seven days. A vast multitude attended from all parts of Judea. Jerusalem is said to have contained at such times "three million people." Amid such a multitude there were frequent tumults and seditions, and the Sanhedrin was justly apprehensive there "would" be now, if, in open day and in the temple, they took away a teacher so popular as Jesus, and put him to death. They therefore sought how they might do it secretly and by guile.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>Mt 26:1-16.

The matter of their deliberation was to <span class="ital">kill</span> Christ, and how they might do it <span class="ital">by subtlety, </span> for they were afraid of the people, who had a great esteem for our Saviour, because of the many miracles he had wrought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But they said, Not on the feast day:</span> that was now within two days, and in order to it the city was full of people, and they were afraid (as they were concerned, being a conquered people, and having but a precarious liberty for their religion) of causing any tumults: this awed them, not any great religion for the festival, for all things now were out of order with them. Their high priest was chosen annually, and at the will of their conquerors; some little appearance they had of their ancient religious government, but it was in no due order. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/26.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they said, not on the feast day,.... Upon mature deliberation, it was an agreed point with them, at least it was carried by a majority, that nothing of this kind should be attempted to be done on the feast day, on any of the days of the feast of passover, which was now at hand; though this was contrary to their common rules and usages: for, a person that sinned presumptuously, and such an one they accounted Jesus to be, they say (a), <p>"they do not put him to death by the order of the sanhedrim of his own city, nor by the sanhedrim of Jabneh; but they bring him up to the great sanhedrim at Jerusalem, and keep him "until the feast", and put him to death,  "on a feast day"; as it is said, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-13.htm">Deuteronomy 17:13</a>, "and all the people shall hear and fear", &amp;c.'' <p>But what influenced them at this time to take another course, is the reason following; <p>lest there be an uproar among the people: they had no fear of God before their eyes, or in their hearts, only the fear of the people; many of whom believed in Christ, and others that did not, yet had a great veneration for him, having seen his miracles, and received favours from him; themselves, or their friends and relations, being cured by him of various diseases: besides, at the feast, people from all parts came up to Jerusalem; and they knew that large numbers from Galilee, where he had the greatest interest, would be present; and they feared, should they attempt anything of this nature at this time, the people would rise, and rescue him out of their hands. But God had determined otherwise, and his counsel shall stand; it was his pleasure, that he should be put to death at this feast, that the truth might answer the type of the passover lamb; and that all Israel, whose males now met together, might be witnesses of it: and so it was, that though these men had concluded otherwise in their council; yet an opportunity offering by Judas, to get him into their hands, they embrace it; and risk the danger of the people's uprising, who they found compliant enough to their wishes. <p>(a) Misn.

They wished to delay the matter until the people, who were then collected in great numbers on account of the Passover, should have departed, after the conclusion of the festival. But as the traitor offered his services, they cast delay aside.

The anointing excited the indignation of Judas; and, after he had cherished it in his bosom for several days, Satan suggested to him the act of betrayal, and in person took possession of the wretched man. It cannot readily be supposed, 1) that it was some other woman rather than Mary, the one so pre-eminently beloved by the Saviour, who obtained the promise of <span class="ital">her deed</span>, nay, even <span class="ital">her own self</span>, being had in <span class="ital">remembrance</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-13.htm" title="Truly I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be preached in the whole world, there shall also this, that this woman has done, be told for a memorial of her.">Matthew 26:13</a>]: for, in fact, of no other woman whatsoever, save Mary, is <span class="ital">the name</span> recorded in connection with this event. Also, it is rather hard to credit, 2) that the pious disciples would have employed <span class="ital">afresh</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-8.htm" title="But when his disciples saw it, they had indignation, saying, To what purpose is this waste?">Matthew 26:8</a>], within a few days after, the <span class="ital">pretext</span> [<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/12-5.htm" title="Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor?...">John 12:5-6</a>] concerning the 300 pence which might have been given to the poor by the sale of the ointment,—a pretext which, when employed by Judas, our Lord had confuted with such force. Finally, 3) Jesus declared the very day of the anointing, as marked by John, to be the one and only day of <span class="ital">His being made ready</span> thereby <span class="ital">for His burial</span>: there cannot, therefore, be any <span class="ital">second</span> day, in Matthew and Mark, of His being in that same condition [viz. of being made <span class="ital">ready for burial</span>]. Nor, besides, is there anything to forbid the supposition, that all things which John records happened in the house of Simon the leper, and that Mary anointed with the precious ointment, first the head, then also the feet of the Saviour; which facts John states in an abbreviated form, as intending to record the wiping of His feet with the hairs of her head.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 493, etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Not</span> <span class="cmt_word">on the feast day</span>; <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1fc7;</span>: <span class="accented">during the feast</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> during the eight days of the Passover celebration. The assembled multitudes did not leave the city until the close of the octave, so the danger of a rising was not removed till then. The rulers well knew the stern temper of Pilate the procurator, who was prepared to crush any popular movement with the strong hand, and at festival times had always his soldiers ready to hurl upon the mob at the slightest provication, and to deal indiscriminate slaughter. Hence arose the plan of a clandestine apprehension. It was, indeed, the custom to execute great criminals at the time of the chief festivals, in order to impress the spectacle of retribution upon the greatest number; but in the case of Jesus, after what had occurred during the last few days, and when Jerusalem was filled with Galilaeans, who might naturally favour their countryman's pretensions, it was deemed dangerous to make any open attack. Their fears were relieved in the most unexpected manner by the appearance of Judas among them (ver. 14). </body></html>
