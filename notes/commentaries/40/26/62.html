The question implies a long-continued silence, while witness after witness were uttering their clumsy falsehoods, the effect of which it is not easy to realise without a more than common exercise of what may be called dramatic imagination. I remember hearing from a distinguished scholar who had seen the Ammergau Passion-mystery, that, as represented there, it came upon him with a force which he had never felt before. In the silence itself we may perhaps trace a deliberate fulfilment of the prophecy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-7.htm" title="He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he opens not his mouth.">Isaiah 53:7</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-23.htm" title="Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judges righteously:">1Peter 2:23</a> we find a record of the impression which that fulfilment made on the disciples.<p><span class= "bld">What is it</span> <span class= "bld">. . .?</span>—The question was clearly put, as it had been before Annas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-19.htm" title="The high priest then asked Jesus of his disciples, and of his doctrine.">John 18:19</a>), with the intention of drawing out something that would ensure condemnation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/26.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-62.htm" title="And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answer you nothing? what is it which these witness against you?...">Matthew 26:62-64</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the high-priest arose, </span>(Mark, <span class="ital">stood up in the midst,</span>) <span class="ital">and said, Answerest thou nothing? </span>— When the high-priest found that Jesus took little notice of the things which the witnesses alleged against him, he rose from his seat in a passion, supposing that our Lord intended to put an affront upon the council, and desired him to give the reason of his conduct. But finding this in vain, in order to cut the trial short and insnare him, he <span class="ital">adjured </span>him, or required him to answer upon oath, whether or not he was the Christ. <span class="ital">I adjure thee — </span><span class="greekheb">Εξορκιζω σε</span>. “This appears to have been the Jewish manner of administering an oath. The Hebrews <span class="greekheb">השׂכיע</span>, which in the Old Testament is commonly, by our interpreters, rendered, <span class="ital">to make one swear, </span>is justly translated by the LXX. <span class="greekheb">ορκιζω</span>, or <span class="greekheb">εξορκιζω</span>. Thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-3.htm" title="And I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and the God of the earth, that you shall not take a wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:">Genesis 24:3</a>, where we have an account of the oath administered by Abraham to his steward, which is rendered in our Bible, <span class="ital">I will make thee swear by the Lord, the God of heaven, </span>&c., is thus expressed in the LXX., <span class="greekheb">εξορκιω σε Κυριον τον Θεον του ουρανου</span>, &c. <span class="ital">I adjure thee by Jehovah, the God of heaven and earth. </span>After such adjuration by a magistrate, or lawful superior, the answer returned by the person adjured was an answer upon oath: a false answer was perjury; and even the silence of the person adjured was not deemed innocent.” He was under the necessity of giving an explicit answer, and of speaking the whole truth without disguise. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm" title="Then shall an oath of the LORD be between them both, that he has not put his hand to his neighbor's goods; and the owner of it shall accept thereof, and he shall not make it good.">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:1</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/29-24.htm" title="Whoever is partner with a thief hates his own soul: he hears cursing, and denudes it not.">Proverbs 29:24</a>. See Campbell. “The craft of the question lay in this, that if Jesus answered it in the affirmative, they were ready to condemn him as a blasphemer; but if in the negative they proposed to punish him as an impostor, who, by accepting the honours and titles of the Messiah from the people, had deceived them.” <span class="ital">Jesus saith, Thou hast said, </span>that is, as Mark expresses it, <span class="ital">I am. </span>Being put upon oath, or, according to Jewish customs, adjured by the magistrate, he no longer declines answering. And he adds, <span class="ital">Nevertheless, </span>Gr. <span class="greekheb">πλην</span>, <span class="ital">moreover, I say unto you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man </span>— He speaks in the third person, modestly, yet plainly: <span class="ital">sitting on the right hand of power </span>— That is, of God: <span class="ital">and coming in the clouds of heaven </span>— As he is represented by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/daniel/7-13.htm" title="I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him....">Daniel 7:13-14</a>. Our Lord looked very unlike that person now! But nothing could be more awful, more majestic, and becoming, than such an admonition in such circumstances! The sending down of the Holy Ghost, the wonderful progress of the gospel, the destruction of Jerusalem, of the temple, and of the Jewish state, were unquestionable proofs and demonstrations shown forth by Jesus Christ of the infinite power wherewith he was invested at the right hand of God.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:57-68 Jesus was hurried into Jerusalem. It looks ill, and bodes worse, when those who are willing to be Christ's disciples, are not willing to be known to be so. Here began Peter's denying him: for to follow Christ afar off, is to begin to go back from him. It is more our concern to prepare for the end, whatever it may be, than curiously to ask what the end will be. The event is God's, but the duty is ours. Now the Scriptures were fulfilled, which said, False witnesses are risen up against me. Christ was accused, that we might not be condemned; and if at any time we suffer thus, let us remember we cannot expect to fare better than our Master. When Christ was made sin for us, he was silent, and left it to his blood to speak. Hitherto Jesus had seldom professed expressly to be the Christ, the Son of God; the tenor of his doctrine spoke it, and his miracles proved it; but now he would not omit to make an open confession of it. It would have looked like declining his sufferings. He thus confessed, as an example and encouragement to his followers, to confess him before men, whatever hazard they ran. Disdain, cruel mocking, and abhorrence, are the sure portion of the disciple as they were of the Master, from such as would buffet and deride the Lord of glory. These things were exactly foretold in the fiftieth chapter of Isaiah. Let us confess Christ's name, and bear the reproach, and he will confess us before his Father's throne.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus held his peace - Was silent. He knew that the evidence did not even appear to amount to anything worth a reply. He knew that they were aware of that, and that feeling that, the high priest attempted to draw something from him on which they could condemn him.<p>I adjure thee by the living God - I put thee upon thy oath before God. This was the usual form of putting an oath among the Jews. It implies calling God to witness the truth of what was said. The law respecting witnesses also made it a violation of an oath to conceal any part of the truth; and though our Saviour might have felt that such a question, put in such a manner, was very improper or was unlawful, yet he also knew that to be silent would be construed into a denial of his being the Christ. The question was probably put in auger. They had utterly failed in their proof. They had no way left to accomplish their purpose of condemning him but to draw it from his own lips. This cunning question was therefore proposed. The difficulty of the question consisted in this: If he confessed that he was the Son of God, they stood ready to condemn him for "blasphemy;" if he denied it, they were prepared to condemn him for being an impostor, and for deluding the people under the pretence of being the Messiah.<p>The living God - Yahweh is called the living God in opposition to idols, which were without life.<p>The Christ - The Messiah, the Anointed. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>.<p>The Son of God - The Jews uniformly expected that the Messiah would be the Son of God. In their view it denoted, also, that he would be "divine," or equal to the Father, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/10-31.htm">John 10:31-36</a>. To claim that title was therefore, in their view, "blasphemy;" and as they had determined beforehand in their own minds that he was not the Messiah, they were ready at once to accuse him of blasphemy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 26:57-75.
