The greater profession men make of religion, the greater opportunity they have of doing mischief, if their hearts be not right with God. Observe, that Christ's own disciple, who knew so well his doctrine and manner of his life, and was false to him, could not charge him with any thing criminal, though it would have served to justify his treachery. What did Judas want? Was not he welcome wherever his Master was? Did he not fare as Christ fared? It is not the lack, but the love of money, that is the root of all evil. After he had made that wicked bargain, Judas had time to repent, and to revoke it; but when lesser acts of dishonesty have hardened the conscience men do without hesitation that which is more shameful.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sought opportunity to betray him - Luke adds, "in the absence of the multitude." This was the chief difficulty - to deliver him into the hands of the priests so as not to have it known by the people, or so as not to excite tumult.<p>The "opportunity" which he sought, therefore, was one in which the multitude would not see him, or could not rescue the Saviour.<p>To betray him - The word "betray" commonly means to deliver into the hands of an enemy by treachery or breach of trust; to do it while friendship or faithfulness is "professed." All this took place in the case of Judas. But the word in the original does not necessarily imply this. It means simply to "deliver up," or to give into their hands. He sought opportunity "how he might deliver him up to them," agreeably to the contract. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 26<p>Mt 26:1-16.

This being what they desired, and were consulting how to effect, they were glad of such an offer, and agreed with him for a sum of money. No evangelist but Matthew, in this place, mentions the particular sum, which was <span class="ital">thirty pieces of silver.</span> Interpreters do very probably think that these thirty pieces were thirty staters or shekels of the sanctuary, which being but of the value of two shillings and six pence apiece, amounted but to three pounds fifteen shillings in our money, which was the sum appointed by the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-32.htm" title="If the ox shall push a manservant or a maidservant; he shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver, and the ox shall be stoned.">Exodus 21:32</a></span>, to be paid for a servant gored to death by the beast of another, the poorest and meanest price of any person’s life: Judas left it to them, and they set the meanest price imaginable. There are other opinions about the value of these pieces of silver, but this is the most probable, especially considering the mean opinion these men had of Christ, and their design and interest to depreciate him as much as might be, and that the priests were the great men in this council, who most probably agreed with him for such pieces of money as were most in use amongst the Jews. It may be a just matter of admiration that they should make so cheap a bargain with him, considering that they doubtless (had he insisted upon it) would have given him more; but there was a prophecy to be fulfilled, which we find <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-12.htm" title="And I said to them, If you think good, give me my price; and if not, forbear.

The price was set by the council of Heaven, which had determined this degree of our Lord’s humiliation, that as he took upon him the form of a servant, so his life should be valued at the rate of an ordinary servant’s life. Though therefore Judas was covetous enough to have asked more, and it is like the malice of those councillors would have edged them to have given more, yet it was thus ordered by the Divine council. Christ must be sold cheap, that he might be the more dear to the souls of the redeemed ones. For thirty pieces of silver he covenanted with them, and they promised it to him; whether it was now paid, or when he had done his work, appeareth not.

Luke adds, "in the absence of the multitude", <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-6.htm">Luke 22:6</a>; in the most private manner, when he was alone, and in some solitary place, that no tumult might arise, and that there might be no danger of a rescue: for so he, and the chief priests, had consulted, and settled it, as what would be most prudent and advisable; and therefore, from that time forward, being prompted on by Satan, and the lucre of the money he was to receive, he narrowly watched, and diligently observed, the best and most fitting season to perform his enterprise, and quickly offered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/26.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-16.htm" title="And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.">Matthew 26:16</a>. <span class="greekheb">εὐκαιρίαν</span>, a good occasion, the verb, <span class="greekheb">εὐκαιρέω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-31.htm" title="And he said to them, Come you yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest a while: for there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.">Mark 6:31</a>), belongs to late Greek (Lobeck, <span class="ital">Phryn.</span>, p. 125).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From that time.</span> As soon as he had made his bargain. <span class="cmt_word">Opportunity</span>.
