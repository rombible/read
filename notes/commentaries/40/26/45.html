We might, at first, be inclined to see in them a shade of implied reproach. “Sleep on now, if sleep under such conditions is possible; make the most of the short interval that remains before the hour of the betrayal comes.” Something of this kind seems obviously implied, but the sudden change is, perhaps, best explained by the supposition that it was not till after these words had been spoken that the Traitor and his companions were seen actually approaching, and that it was this that led to the words seemingly so different in their purport, bidding the slumberers to rouse themselves from sleep. The past, which, as far as their trial went, might have been given to sleep, was over. A new crisis had come calling for action.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/26.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>26:36-46 He who made atonement for the sins of mankind, submitted himself in a garden of suffering, to the will of God, from which man had revolted in a garden of pleasure. Christ took with him into that part of the garden where he suffered his agony, only those who had witnessed his glory in his transfiguration. Those are best prepared to suffer with Christ, who have by faith beheld his glory. The words used denote the most entire dejection, amazement, anguish, and horror of mind; the state of one surrounded with sorrows, overwhelmed with miseries, and almost swallowed up with terror and dismay. He now began to be sorrowful, and never ceased to be so till he said, It is finished. He prayed that, if possible, the cup might pass from him. But he also showed his perfect readiness to bear the load of his sufferings; he was willing to submit to all for our redemption and salvation. According to this example of Christ, we must drink of the bitterest cup which God puts into our hands; though nature struggle, it must submit. It should be more our care to get troubles sanctified, and our hearts satisfied under them, than to get them taken away. It is well for us that our salvation is in the hand of One who neither slumbers nor sleeps. All are tempted, but we should be much afraid of entering into temptation. To be secured from this, we should watch and pray, and continually look unto the Lord to hold us up that we may be safe. Doubtless our Lord had a clear and full view of the sufferings he was to endure, yet he spoke with the greatest calmness till this time. Christ was a Surety, who undertook to be answerable for our sins. Accordingly he was made sin for us, and suffered for our sins, the Just for the unjust; and Scripture ascribes his heaviest sufferings to the hand of God. He had full knowledge of the infinite evil of sin, and of the immense extent of that guilt for which he was to atone; with awful views of the Divine justice and holiness, and the punishment deserved by the sins of men, such as no tongue can express, or mind conceive. At the same time, Christ suffered being tempted; probably horrible thoughts were suggested by Satan that tended to gloom and every dreadful conclusion: these would be the more hard to bear from his perfect holiness. And did the load of imputed guilt so weigh down the soul of Him of whom it is said, He upholdeth all things by the word of his power? into what misery then must those sink whose sins are left upon their own heads! How will those escape who neglect so great salvation?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Sleep on now and take your rest - Most interpreters have supposed that this should be translated as a question rattler than a command,<p>"Do you sleep now and take your rest? Is this a time, amid so much danger and so many enemies. to give yourselves to sleep?" This construction is strongly countenanced by <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-46.htm">Luke 22:46</a>, where the expression. Why sleep ye? evidently refers to the same point of time. There is no doubt that the Greek will bear this construction, and in this way the apparent inconsistency will be removed between this command "to sleep," and that in the next verse, "to rise" and be going. Others suppose that, his agony being over, and the necessity of watching with him being now past, he kindly permitted them to seek repose until they should be roused by the coming of the traitor; that while they slept Jesus continued still awake; that some considerable time elapsed between what was spoken here and in the next verse; and that Jesus suffered them to sleep until he saw Judas coming, and then aroused them. This is the most probable opinion. Others have supposed that he spoke this in irony: "Sleep on now, if you can; take rest, if possible, in such dangers and at such a time." But this supposition is unworthy the Saviour and the occasion. Mark adds, "It is enough." That is, sufficient time has been given to sleep. It is time to arise and be going.<p>The hour is at hand - The "time" when the Son of man is to be betrayed is near.<p>Sinners - Judas, the Roman soldiers, and the Jews. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/26.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 26:36-46.

The Evangelist Mark adds, "it is enough", <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-41.htm">Mark 14:41</a>; which has induced some interpreters to think, that these words were spoken seriously by Christ: though the sense cannot be that they had watched sufficiently, and now might sleep, and take their rest, for they had not watched at all; but rather, that he had now no need of them, or their watching with him; the conflict was over for the present; or, as the Syriac version renders it, "the end is come"; and so the Arabic; and to the same purpose the Persic, "the matter is come to an end", or to an extremity; the sense being the same with what is expressed in the following clause, "the hour is at hand"; and shows, that the words are to be understood in an ironical sense, sleep on and take your rest, if you can: I have been exhorting you to watchfulness, but to no purpose, you will be alarmed from another quarter; a band of soldiers is just at hand to seize and carry me away, and now sleep if you can: that this is the sense appears from the reason given, and from the exhortation in the following verse, and the reason annexed to that: <p>behold the hour is at hand, and the son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners: by the son of man Christ means himself, and under this diminutive title expresses his Messiahship, this being a character of the Messiah in the Old Testament; and the truth of his human nature, and the weakness and infirmities of it: by the "betraying", or delivery of him, is intended either the betraying of him by Judas into the hands of the high priest, Scribes, and Pharisees; or the delivery of him, by them, into the hands of Pilate, and by him to the Roman soldiers; all which were by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God. The high priest, elders, Scribes, and Pharisees, notwithstanding all their pretensions to religion, righteousness, and holiness, were very wicked persons; though the Gentiles, the band of Roman soldiers, Judas brought with him to take Christ, are here rather meant, it being usual to call the Gentiles sinners. This betraying and delivery of Christ into the hands of these, was determined by God; the time, the very hour was fixed, and was now approaching; the last sand in the glass was dropping; for as soon as Christ had said these words, Judas, with his band of soldiers, appeared. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/26.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/26.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm" title="Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.">Matthew 26:45</a>.

To object, as is frequently done, that the ironical view does not accord with the frame of mind in which Jesus must have been, is to fail to appreciate aright the nature of the situation. Irony is not inconsistent even with the deepest anguish of soul, especially in cases where such anguish is also accompanied with such clearness of judgment as we find in the present instance; and consider what it was for Jesus to see such an overpowering tendency to sleep on the part of His disciples, and to find everything so different from what He needed, and might reasonably have expected! Winer, p. 292 [E. T. 391], following Chrysostom, Theophylact (who, however, admits the plausibility of the ironical view), and Grotius, excludes the idea of irony, and interprets thus: “<span class="ital">sleep on, then, as you are doing, and take your rest</span>,” which words are supposed to be spoken <span class="ital">permissively</span> in accordance with the calm, mild, resigned spirit produced by the prayers in which He had just been engaged. This is also substantially the view of Kuinoel, de Wette, Morison, Weiss on <span class="ital">Mark</span>; and see even Augustine, who says: “verba <span class="ital">indulgentis</span> eis jam somnum.” But the idea that any such indulgence was seriously intended, would be incompatible with the danger referred to at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-41.htm" title="Watch and pray, that you enter not into temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.">Matthew 26:41</a>, and which He knew was threatening <span class="ital">even the disciples themselves</span>. There are <span class="ital">others</span>, again, who are disposed to take the words interrogatively, thus: are ye <span class="ital">still</span> asleep? Such is the view of Henry Stephens, Heumann, Kypke, Krebs, in spite of the ordinary usage with regard to <span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπόν</span>, to understand which in the sense of “<span class="ital">henceforth</span>” (Bleek, Volkmar) would be entirely out of keeping with the use of the <span class="ital">present</span> here. If, however, the mark of interrogation be inserted after <span class="greekheb">καθεύδετε</span>, and <span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπὸν καὶ ἀναπαύεσθε</span> be then taken imperatively (Klostermann), in that case <span class="greekheb">καί</span> would have the intensive force of <span class="ital">even</span>; but its logical position would have to be before <span class="greekheb">τὸ λοιπόν</span>, not before <span class="greekheb">ἀναπαύεσθε</span>, where it could be rendered admissible at all only by an artificial twisting of the sense (“now you may henceforth <span class="ital">rest on, even as long as you choose</span>”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>While Jesus is in the act of uttering His <span class="greekheb">καθεύδετε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., He observes the hostile band approaching; the painful irony changes to a painful earnestness, and He continues in abrupt and disjointed words: <span class="greekheb">ἰδοὺ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἤγγικεν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

The temptation was to suppress rather than to invent in regard both to the behaviour of Jesus and to that of His disciples. It is not the creation of theology, though theology has made its own use of it. It is recorded simply because it was known to have happened.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/26.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">45, 46</span>. <span class="ital">Sleep on now … Rise, let us be going</span>] The sudden transition may be explained either (1) by regarding the first words as intended for a rebuke, or else (2) at that very moment Judas appeared, and the time for action had come. The short, quick sentences, especially as reported by St Mark, favour the second suggestion.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/26.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-45.htm" title="Then comes he to his disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.">Matthew 26:45</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καθεύδετε τὸ λοιπὸν</span>, <span class="ital">sleep on now</span>) An imperative, leaving the disciples, as it were to themselves, wholly given up as they were to sleep, and thus exciting them so much the more urgently by tenderness joined with severity. It is not an instance of irony, but metonymy, <span class="ital">q.d.</span> “You do not listen to Me when attempting to rouse you, others soon will come and rouse yon. In the meanwhile sleep, if you have leisure for so doing.” In St Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-46.htm" title="And said to them, Why sleep you? rise and pray, lest you enter into temptation.">Luke 22:46</a>) we find <span class="greekheb">τί καθεύδετε</span> “<span class="ital">why sleep ye</span>?” with an interrogation, which some have introduced into St Matthew and St Mark.—<span class="greekheb">ἀναπαύεσθε</span>, <span class="ital">take your rest</span>), as <span class="ital">Sleep</span> is opposed to <span class="ital">Watching</span>, so <span class="ital">Rest</span> to the labour of prayer.—<span class="greekheb">ἠ ὥρα</span>, <span class="ital">the hour</span>) often foretold. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-18.htm" title="And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to him, The Master said, My time is at hand; I will keep the passover at your house with my disciples.">Matthew 26:18</a> He had said less definitely “<span class="ital">My time</span>.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 45.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Cometh he.</span> St. Hilary comments on these three visits: "On his first return he reproves, on the second he holds his peace, on the third he bids to rest." The contest was over; the human will was now entirely one with the Divine will. <span class="cmt_word">Sleep on now</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c0;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">henceforward</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>and take your rest.</span> This is probably to be understood literally. There was a short interval still before the apprehension and the subsequent events; as they could not watch, they might use this in finishing their sleep, and recruiting their wearied bodies in preparation for the coming trial. Many expositors find an irony in Christ's words, taken in connection with those that follow, as if he meant, "In a few minutes I shall be seized; sleep on if you can; you will soon be miserably awakened, make the most of the present." But at this moment the tender Jesus would surely never have condescended to address his friends in such a style. All his words and actions were animated with the deepest love for them and anxiety on their account. A change to irony is really inconceivable under the circumstances. Nor is there any reason to take the sentence interrogatively, "Sleep ye at such a moment?" It is more simple to regard the words as said <span class="accented">bona fide</span>, with no mental reservation and no implied censure. We may suppose that a pause ensued before the utterance of the next clause, and that the Lord allowed his fatigued followers to sleep on till the last moment. <span class="cmt_word">Behold, the hour is at hand, and</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, equivalent to <span class="accented">when</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>the Son of man is betrayed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, <span class="accented">is being betrayed</span>) <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>into the hands of sinners.</span> He calls all simmers who take part in his apprehension, trial, and death - not the Romans only (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>), but priests, eiders, multitude, who joined in the crowd and incurred the guilt. There is now no sign of wavering; he is ready, yea, eager to meet the sufferings which he foresees. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/26.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The hour is at hand<p>He probably heard the tramp and saw the lanterns of Judas and his band. </body></html>
