Either the suddenness of their Lord’s departure had deprived them of their customary forethought, or, it may be, they were beginning to depend wrongly on the wonder-working power, as though it would be used, not as before, to supply the wants of the famished multitude, but as rendering that forethought needless for themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread....">Matthew 16:5-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">When his disciples were come to the other side </span>— Namely, of the sea of Tiberias, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-13.htm" title="And he left them, and entering into the ship again departed to the other side.">Mark 8:13</a>; <span class="ital">they had forgotten to take bread</span> — They had tarried so long in Dalmanutha, or Magdala, that they had consumed the seven baskets of fragments which they had taken up at the late miracle, recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-32.htm" title="Then Jesus called his disciples to him, and said, I have compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them away fasting, lest they faint in the way....">Matthew 15:32-39</a>, and had no more than one loaf with them in the ship, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-14.htm" title="Now the disciples had forgotten to take bread, neither had they in the ship with them more than one loaf.">Mark 8:14</a>. <span class="ital">Then Jesus said, Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees </span>— That is, of their false doctrine; elegantly called <span class="ital">leaven, </span>for it spreads in the soul, or the church, as leaven does in meal. <span class="ital">And they reasoned among themselves </span>— What must we do then for bread, since we have taken no bread with us? Thus the slowness of their understanding showed itself on this occasion, as it had done on many others. “As they had forgotten to take bread, and had often heard the doctors prohibit the use of the leaven of heathen and Samaritans, they thought he forbade them to buy bread from bakers of either sect, lest it might be made with impure leaven, and so they looked on the advice as an indirect reproof of their carelessness.” <span class="ital">Which when Jesus perceived </span>— As he knew all the secret workings of their minds; <span class="ital">he said, O ye of little faith, why reason ye? </span>— Why are ye troubled about this? Why should your neglecting to bring bread with you make you put such an interpretation upon my words? Am I not able, if need so require, to supply you by a word? Observe, reader, to distrust Christ, and disquiet our own minds, when we are in straits and difficulties, is an evidence of the weakness of our faith, which, if it were in exercise as it should be would deliver us from the burden of care, by enabling us to cast it on the Lord, <span class="ital">who careth for us. Do ye not understand </span>— After having been so long with me, are ye still ignorant of my power and goodness? <span class="ital">neither remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets, </span>&c. — Certainly you are very stupid, if you have forgotten how that with five loaves I fed five thousand men, who, after being fully satisfied, left a great deal more than the quantity that was at first set before me to divide among them. <span class="ital">Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand </span>— An instance of a merciful and miraculous supply which happened so lately. <span class="ital">How is it that ye do not understand? </span>— How came ye not to know that he, who on those different occasions fed such multitudes with such a little quantity of food, can never be at a loss to provide a meal for twelve? The experience which they had so lately had of the power and goodness of Christ in providing for them, was a great aggravation of their distrust. Though they had no bread with them, they had <span class="ital">Him </span>with them who could provide bread for them. God’s people may well be ashamed of the slowness and dulness of their apprehensions in divine things; especially when they have long enjoyed the means of grace. As Christ’s disciples well deserved the sharp rebuke which their Master gave them on this occasion, so it had the designed effect; for it brought the disciples to understand that he designed to caution them against the corrupt doctrines of the Pharisees and Sadducees; the pernicious nature and tendency of which may be learned from many instances taken notice of and condemned by Jesus himself, in the course of his ministry.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/16.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>16:5-12 Christ speaks of spiritual things under a similitude, and the disciples misunderstand him of carnal things.

Of the sea, as Munster's Hebrew Gospel adds, to Bethsaida, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/8-22.htm">Mark 8:22</a> as they were either in the ship, or going from the shore to the said place, they recollected themselves, <p>that they had forgotten to take bread: having but one loaf, as Mark says, in the ship; the seven baskets of fragments being either expended, or given away to the poor, of their own accord, or by Christ's orders. It seems, it was usual with the disciples to buy food at places most proper, and carry with them; since Christ often went into deserts and mountainous places, where provisions could not be had. This their forgetfulness to act according to their wonted method, might arise either from their being intent upon Christ's conversation with the Pharisees, and Sadducees, or from the suddenness of Christ's departure. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.</span><p>(2) False teachers must be taken warning of.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/16.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.">Matthew 16:5</a>.

The one important thing in this section is the reflection of Jesus on what had just taken place. The historical setting is not clear. Jesus left the sign seekers after giving them their answer. The disciples cross the lake; in which direction? With or without their Master? They forget to take bread. When? On setting out or after arrival at the other side? <span class="greekheb">ἐλθόντες εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.">Matthew 16:5</a>, naturally suggests the latter, but, as Grotius remarks, the verb <span class="greekheb">ἔρχεσθαι</span> in the Gospels sometimes means <span class="ital">ire</span> not <span class="ital">venire</span> (<span class="ital">vide</span>, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/15-20.htm" title="And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and fell on his neck, and kissed him.">Luke 15:20</a>). Suffice it to say that either in the boat or after arrival at the opposite side Jesus uttered a memorable word.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5–12</span>.

The district which they were about to traverse was but sparsely inhabited, and offered no hope of supplying this want. It is doubted whether the ensuing conversation took place during the voyage or after they had landed. The language of St. Mark inclines one to believe that the deficiency was discovered during the transit, and the remarks now narrated were made then. As it would take some hours to cross, there was ample time to feel and expatiate upon the need; and if Christ had told them of his future movements, they would naturally feel regret for their carelessness and want of forethought. Or it might be that Christ's observation concerning the leaven was made in the beat, and his reproof of their thoughts was given on landing. </body></html>
