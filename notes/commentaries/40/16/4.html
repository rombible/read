You pretend yourselves to be the children of Abraham, but you are bastards rather than his children; he saw my day afar off and rejoiced, you will not believe though you see me amongst you, and at your doors; he believed without any sign, you will not believe though I have showed you many signs. You shall have no such sign as you would have; the sign of the prophet Jonah is enough. But in our Lord’s former reference of them to the prophet Jonah, he instanced in one particular, viz. his being three days and three nights in the belly of the whale; here he seemeth more generally to refer to Jonah as a type of him in more respects, which indeed he was. Chemnitius reckons them up thus: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Jonah was thrown into the sea by the mariners, to whom he had entrusted himself: Christ was delivered to death by the Jews, to whom he was specially promised. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Jonah was willingly thrown into the sea: Christ laid down his life, and man took it not from him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Jonah by being cast into the sea saved those in the ship: Christ by his death saved the children of men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Jonah after he had been in the whale’s belly three days was cast up on dry land: Christ after three days rose again from the dead. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. The Ninevites, though upon the preaching of Jonah they made a show of repentance, yet returning to their former sins were soon after destroyed; so were the Jews within forty years after Christ’s ascension. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> So as Jonah was many ways an eminent sign and type of Christ. Our Lord having referred them to study this sign, would entertain no more discourse with them, but leaves, and departeth from them.

Jonah returning from the whale proved his mission to the Ninevites; thus by the resurrection of Jesus, whom they had not before believed, a proof was given to the Jews, that He was the Messiah. He silently intimates, moreover, that after the three days spent in the middle of the earth, there should be plenty of signs from heaven, which were performed by His ascension into heaven, and shall be performed at the destruction of the heavens; cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-30.htm" title="And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory.">Matthew 24:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-19.htm" title="And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:">Acts 2:19</a>.

Under similar circumstances he repeats himself, but he wastes not time in useless discussions with perverse opponents who will not see the truth. Of his death and resurrection, whereof Jonah was a type, they knew and understood nothing. Perhaps they thought of Jonah only as a prophet against the heathen city Nineveh, and a preacher of repentance, and were disposed to resent the allusion as an affront to their vaunted righteousness. <span class="cmt_word">He left them.</span> Took ship for Magedan, and crossed the lake to the northeast shore, in the neighbourhood of Bethsaida Julias.
