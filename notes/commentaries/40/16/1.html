The Herodians were the Galilean Sadducees, and the union of the two hostile parties was the continuation of the alliance which had begun after our Lord’s protest against the false reverence for the Sabbath, which was common to both the parties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-6.htm" title="And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.">Mark 3:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">That he would</span> <span class= "bld">shew them a sign from heaven.</span>—The signs and wonders that had been wrought on earth were not enough for the questioners.

They wanted some such sign, as the standing still of the sun and moon, in the times of Joshua; and as raining manna, in the times of Moses; or some such appearances of thunder and lightning, as at the giving of the law.

The Evangelists describe only two attempts of the Sadducees against our Lord (the first of which occurs in the present passage), for they cared less than the Pharisees about religion.—<span class="greekheb">ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">from heaven</span>) Miracles had been performed from heaven in the times of Moses, Joshua, and Elijah. The reason why the Pharisees were unwilling to accept as Divine the miracles hitherto performed by our Lord, seems to have been this: that since He had not yet produced any sign from heaven, they thought that the others might proceed even from Satan (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm" title="But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow does not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the devils.">Matthew 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>); and that they considered that a sign from heaven affecting the whole creation, would be greater than any signs performed on the microcosm[707] of man. [Perhaps, also, they were relying on the prophecy of Joel; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-19.htm" title="And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke:">Acts 2:19</a>.—V. g.] The Sadducees, who disbelieved the existence of any Spirit, and therefore of Satan himself, were of opinion that our Lord’s power extended only to hunger, and the diseases of the body, not to all greater matters. Both were influenced also by another motive, namely, the desire to witness a variety of miracles, considered merely as sights. Their lust[708] (libido) is indicated by the word <span class="greekheb">θέλομεν</span>, <span class="ital">we wish</span>, in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[707] “Signa in microcosmo,” signs performed in <span class="ital">the little world</span>, the limited horizon, of which man is the centre.—ED.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[708] The word is, of course, not to be taken in the literal force of its ordinary signification, but rather in the wider sense which it has in English writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-16.htm" title="For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.">1 John 2:16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-17.htm" title="For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that you cannot do the things that you would.">Galatians 5:17</a>), though there is a special allusion to the epithet <span class="ital">adulterous</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm" title="Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered, saying, Master, we would see a sign from you.">Matthew 12:38</a>, and infra <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-5.htm" title="And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had forgotten to take bread.">Matthew 16:5</a>, and to the common source of the various manifestations of the <span class="greekheb">φρόνημα σαρκὸς</span>.—(I.

The two sects were directly opposed to each other, the traditional belief of the former being antagonistic to the scepticism and materialism of the latter. But both were hostile to Christ, whose teaching, on the one hand interfered with rabbinism, and on the other maintained the existence of the supernatural and the certainty of the resurrection. The Sadducees alone seem to have attacked Christ only on two occasions. They were probably Herodians (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>), and on this account also disliked by the Pharisees; but they were powerful, and held most of the highest offices in the state, and their alliance was sought or allowed in order more effectually to compromise Jesus. Even theological hatred and political opposition sank into indifference in the face of what was regarded as a common danger. Strauss and his school regard this combination as so unnatural that they throw discredit on the whole account. This is shallow criticism. Nothing is more common than for persons opposed on all other subjects to coalesce for an unholy purpose in which they are jointly interested. The most violent political opponents will join forces in order to gain some desired point, and. when an attack on the Church is meditated, even unbelievers are gladly welcomed. Tertullian says forcibly, "Christ is always being crucified between two thieves." <span class="cmt_word">Tempting</span>. Trying him with captious questions, to bring him into a difficulty, or to give them an opportunity of accusing him of heterodoxy, or disloyalty, or insubordination, and of discrediting him with the people. <span class="cmt_word">A sign from heaven.</span> The rabbis held that demons and. false gods could perform certain miracles on earth, but God alone could give signs from heaven, such as, <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, the manna of Moses' time, the staying of the sun and moon by Joshua, the lightning and thunder that came at Samuel's word, the stroke of death on the captains who tried to arrest Elijah. They had heard of the miraculous meal just before, and saw how deeply the people were moved by it, and they would imply that such a miracle was no proof of a Divine mission, as it might have been wrought by magical or Satanic agency. Let Christ give a sign from heaven, and they would acknowledge his claims. They knew what Christ's answer would be, as they had already attacked him with the same demand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-38.htm">Matthew 12:38</a>); and they hoped that he would either refuse to gratify them, as before, or else make an attempt and fail. In either case they thought they might turn the circumstance to his disadvantage. The Sadducees joined in the request, because they disbelieved in all such occurrences, and were fully persuaded that they were impossible, and any one who attempted to produce them must prove himself a miserable impostor. The word translated desired. (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>) is emphatic; the verb is used classically in the sense of "to put a question for decision;" so the interrogation here would signify that this was to be a final test of the claims of Christ; on his answer depended their adhesion or opposition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-22.htm">1 Corinthians 1:22</a>). </body></html>
