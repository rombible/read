The repetition of the self-same words as had described first the Baptist’s teaching and then our Lord’s, seems to suggest that this was actually a formula of proclamation. The two envoys of the King were to enter into town or village, and there, standing in the gate, to announce that His kingdom had come near, and then, when this had drawn crowds to listen, to call men to the repentance without which they could not enter it.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/10.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/10-7.htm" title="And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand....">Matthew 10:7-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And as ye go, preach </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κηρυσσετε</span>, <span class="ital">proclaim, </span>namely, with ardour and zeal, as becomes my heralds. The word is derived from <span class="greekheb">κηρυξ</span>, <span class="ital">a herald. </span>“Probably,” says Doddridge, “they were to make this proclamation with a loud voice, as they passed through the streets of the towns they went to, as Jonah delivered his message to Nineveh.” <span class="ital">The kingdom of heaven is at hand </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ηγγικεν</span>, <span class="ital">hath approached. </span>Publish everywhere the glad tidings of the approach of the Messiah’s kingdom, promised by the prophets. Properly speaking, the kingdom of heaven, or gospel kingdom, did not begin till the Jewish dispensation was abolished, and therefore the apostles, in our Lord’s time, and even our Lord himself, preached the <span class="ital">approach </span>only, and not the actual existence of that kingdom. But though the apostles were directed to preach the approach of this kingdom, they did not yet fully understand its nature, that it was not to be a temporal, but a spiritual kingdom, consisting in the dominion of truth and grace, of righteousness, peace, and joy within men. <span class="ital">Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, </span>&c. — Perform all these miraculous cures in confirmation of your mission, to prove to men the certain truth and unspeakable importance of your message. <span class="ital">Freely ye have received </span>— All things; in particular the power of working miracles: <span class="ital">freely give </span>— Exert that power wherever you come, and that in a manner honourable to yourselves and me: scorn the thought of making any gain of those for whom these works of mercy and power are performed. That this clause relates to the miraculous cures which the apostles were empowered to perform, and not to the stated offices of the apostolical function, is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm" title="And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.">Luke 10:7</a>, where our Lord, in giving a like commission to the seventy, bid them eat and drink what was set before them, “because the labourer was worthy of his hire.” Nay, in this very charge, no sooner did he order the apostles to give freely, than he forbade them to provide gold, &c., because the labourer, says he, <span class="ital">is worthy of his meat, </span>plainly insinuating that while they were preaching the gospel, they had a right to a maintenance from those who enjoyed the benefit of their labours, and should in the course of the divine providence be supplied with all things necessary.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The kingdom of heaven is at hand - Or, more literally, the "reign" of heaven, or of God, draws near.

They were to live as guests in selected dwellings, two in one, and two in another, for a time, and their preaching would take the form of familiar conversation on what they had seen and heard Jesus do and say. They would talk by the hour, healing acts would be very occasional, one or two in a village.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/10.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-7.htm" title="And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 10:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Πορευόμενοι</span>, <span class="ital">as ye go</span>) Answering to <span class="greekheb">πορεύεσθε</span> (<span class="ital">go ye</span>), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-6.htm" title="But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.">Matthew 10:6</a>.—<span class="greekheb">κηρύσσετε</span>, <span class="ital">preach ye</span>) Here were the disciples going forth like students in theology, who practise the rudiments of the ministry and perform the functions of curates, and afterwards return to receive further instruction.[455]—<span class="greekheb">ἤγγικεν</span>, <span class="ital">is at hand</span>) This was to be the burden and sum of their discourses;[456] cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-12.htm" title="And they went out, and preached that men should repent.">Mark 6:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[455] They themselves, in fact, were as yet destitute of perfect knowledge of Jesus Christ, who not until afterwards instructed them more distinctly concerning His passion, death, and resurrection.
