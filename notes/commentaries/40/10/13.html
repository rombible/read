It must be remembered, however, that the missionaries entered each city or village as strangers, and that in such a case even the most careful inquiry might not always be successful.<p><span class= "bld">Let your peace come upon it</span>—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> the peace implied in the formula of salutation. The imperative is not so much a command addressed to them as the proclamation of an edict from the King in whose name they went. Their greeting was not to be a mere ceremonious form. It would be as a real prayer wherever the conditions of peace were fulfilled on the other side. At the worst, the prayer for peace would bring a blessing on him who prayed.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If the house be worthy - That is, if the "family" be worthy, or be willing to receive you as my disciples.<p>Let your peace come upon it - That is, let the peace or happiness which you seek or for which you pray in saluting it (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-5.htm">Luke 10:5</a>), come upon it; or seek their peace and happiness by prayer, instruction, by remaining with them, and imparting to them the blessings of the gospel.<p>But if it be not worthy ... - If the family be unwilling to receive you; if they show themselves unfriendly to you and your message.<p>Let your peace return to you - This is a Hebrew mode of saying that your peace shall not come upon it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/35-13.htm">Psalm 35:13</a>. It is a mode of speaking derived from bestowing a gift. If people were willing to receive it, they derived the benefit from it; if not, then of course the present came back or remained in the hand of the giver. So Christ figuratively speaks of the peace which their labor would confer. If received kindly and hospitably by the people, they would confer on them most valuable blessings. If rejected and persecuted, the blessings which they sought for others would come upon themselves. they would reap the benefit of being cast out and persecuted for their Master's sake, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm">Matthew 5:10</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. And if the house be worthy&#8212;showing this by giving you a welcome.<p>let your peace come upon it&#8212;This is best explained by the injunction to the Seventy, "And into whatsoever house ye enter, first say, Peace be to this house" (Lu 10:5). This was the ancient salutation of the East, and it prevails to this day. But from the lips of Christ and His messengers, it means something far higher, both in the gift and the giving of it, than in the current salutation. (See on [1256]Joh 14:27).<p>but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you&#8212;If your peace finds a shut, instead of an open, door in the heart of any household, take it back to yourselves, who know how to value it; and it will taste the sweeter to you for having been offered, even though rejected.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-15.htm" title="Truly I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that city.">Matthew 10:15</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if the house be worthy,.... If the family, and particularly the master of it, appeared to be civil, courteous, friendly, and hospitable, upon such a salutation, and ready to receive and embrace them, and provide for them, <p>let your peace come upon it, or it shall come upon it; the imperative for the future, which is not unusual; and so read the Syriac and Vulgate Latin. The sense is, the peace the apostles wished for, in their form of salutation, should come, and abide on the family; for not the Gospel of peace, and the preaching of it, are here meant, but the salutation itself, or the things desired in it, which should be granted, and the house be blessed for their sake, and as a reward of their generosity, and hospitality: <p>but if it be not worthy: does not prove to be what it was said to be, and they expected; namely, to be generous, liberal, and beneficent; but, on the contrary, uncivil and churlish, should neglect their salutation, discover an unwillingness to receive them, and turn their backs upon them: <p>let your peace return to you, or "it shall return to you"; the happiness wished for shall not come upon them, and the prayers and good wishes of the apostles shall be void, and of none effect, with respect to that family, but should be made good to themselves; and they should be directed to another house, where they should find persons more generous and free to entertain them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/10.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if the house be worthy, let your <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> peace come upon it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.</span><p>(e) It is an idiom taken from the Hebrews, by which they meant every type of happiness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/10.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-13.htm" title="And if the house be worthy, let your peace come on it: but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.">Matthew 10:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀξία</span>] not “<span class="ital">bonis votis, quae salute dicenda continebuntur</span>” (Fritzsche), but, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-11.htm" title="And into whatever city or town you shall enter, inquire who in it is worthy; and there abide till you go there.">Matthew 10:11</a>, <span class="ital">worthy of your remaining in it</span>.
