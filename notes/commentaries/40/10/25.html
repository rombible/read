To be as their Master in anything, even in shame and suffering, might well be enough for any scholar.<p><span class= "bld">Beelzebub.</span>—The Greek gives the form <span class= "ital">Beel-zebul.</span> Its history illustrates some interesting phases of Jewish thought. (1.) It appears in the form <span class= "ital">Baal-zebub,</span> the “Lord of flies” (probably as sending or averting the swarms of flies or locusts that are one of the plagues of the East), as the name of a god worshipped by the Philistines at Ekron, and consulted as an oracle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2Kings 1:2</a>) in cases of disease. (2.) Later Jews, identifying all heathen deities with evil spirits, saw in the god of their nearest and most hated neighbours the chief or prince of those “demons,” and in their scorn transformed the name into <span class= "ital">Baal-zebel,</span> which would mean “Lord of dung,” or <span class= "ital">Baal-zebul,</span> “Lord of the dwelling”—<span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> of the house of the evil spirits who are the enemies of God. Our Lord’s connection of the name with “the master of the house” seems to point to the latter meaning as that present to our Lord’s thoughts. The reference is clearly made to the charge that had already been implied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm" title="But the Pharisees said, He casts out devils through the prince of the devils.">Matthew 9:34</a>. We do not indeed find the name of Beel-zebub there, nor indeed do we meet with the direct application of that name to our Lord anywhere in the Gospel history; but there was obviously but a single step, easily taken, between the language they had actually used and that which is here reported of them.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:16-42 Our Lord warned his disciples to prepare for persecution. They were to avoid all things which gave advantage to their enemies, all meddling with worldly or political concerns, all appearance of evil or selfishness, and all underhand measures. Christ foretold troubles, not only that the troubles might not be a surprise, but that they might confirm their faith. He tells them what they should suffer, and from whom. Thus Christ has dealt fairly and faithfully with us, in telling us the worst we can meet with in his service; and he would have us deal so with ourselves, in sitting down and counting the cost. Persecutors are worse than beasts, in that they prey upon those of their own kind. The strongest bonds of love and duty, have often been broken through from enmity against Christ. Sufferings from friends and relations are very grievous; nothing cuts more. It appears plainly, that all who will live godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecution; and we must expect to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations. With these predictions of trouble, are counsels and comforts for a time of trial. The disciples of Christ are hated and persecuted as serpents, and their ruin is sought, and they need the serpent's wisdom. Be ye harmless as doves. Not only, do nobody any hurt, but bear nobody any ill-will. Prudent care there must be, but not an anxious, perplexing thought; let this care be cast upon God. The disciples of Christ must think more how to do well, than how to speak well. In case of great peril, the disciples of Christ may go out of the way of danger, though they must not go out of the way of duty. No sinful, unlawful means may be used to escape; for then it is not a door of God's opening. The fear of man brings a snare, a perplexing snare, that disturbs our peace; an entangling snare, by which we are drawn into sin; and, therefore, it must be striven and prayed against. Tribulation, distress, and persecution cannot take away God's love to them, or theirs to him. Fear Him, who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell. They must deliver their message publicly, for all are deeply concerned in the doctrine of the gospel. The whole counsel of God must be made known, Ac 20:27. Christ shows them why they should be of good cheer. Their sufferings witnessed against those who oppose his gospel. When God calls us to speak for him, we may depend on him to teach us what to say. A believing prospect of the end of our troubles, will be of great use to support us under them. They may be borne to the end, because the sufferers shall be borne up under them. The strength shall be according to the day. And it is great encouragement to those who are doing Christ's work, that it is a work which shall certainly be done. See how the care of Providence extends to all creatures, even to the sparrows. This should silence all the fears of God's people; Ye are of more value than many sparrows. And the very hairs of your head are all numbered. This denotes the account God takes and keeps of his people. It is our duty, not only to believe in Christ, but to profess that faith, in suffering for him, when we are called to it, as well as in serving him. That denial of Christ only is here meant which is persisted in, and that confession only can have the blessed recompence here promised, which is the real and constant language of faith and love. Religion is worth every thing; all who believe the truth of it, will come up to the price, and make every thing else yield to it. Christ will lead us through sufferings, to glory with him. Those are best prepared for the life to come, that sit most loose to this present life. Though the kindness done to Christ's disciples be ever so small, yet if there be occasion for it, and ability to do no more, it shall be accepted. Christ does not say that they deserve a reward; for we cannot merit any thing from the hand of God; but they shall receive a reward from the free gift of God. Let us boldly confess Christ, and show love to him in all things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The disciple is not above his master ... - That is, you must expect the same treatment which I have received. They have called me, your Master and Teacher, Beelzebub, the prince of the devils (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-15.htm">Luke 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-48.htm">John 8:48</a>), and you must expect that they will call all of the family by the same name. "Beelzebub" was a god of the Ekronites. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>. The word literally means "the god of flies," so called because this idol was supposed to protect them from the numerous swarms of flies with which that country abounded. The correct reading here, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/11-15.htm">Luke 11:15</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/11-18.htm">Luke 11:18-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/3-22.htm">Mark 3:22</a>, is supposed to be, not "Beelzebub," but "Beelzebul" (Griesbach, Hahn, Robinson, Lexicon) an Aramean form of the word meaning the "god of dung" or "filth." The name, thus altered by the Jews by changing a single letter, was given to Satan to express supreme contempt and aversion. The Jews seem to have first given to Satan the name of a pagan god, and then, to express their sense of the character of Satan, to have changed that name by altering a single letter so as to express their aversion in the most emphatic manner. By giving the name to Christ, they poured upon him the greatest possible abuse and contempt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/10.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebub&#8212;All the Greek manuscripts, write "Beelzebul," which undoubtedly is the right form of this word. The other reading came in no doubt from the Old Testament "Baalzebub," the god of Ekron (2Ki 1:2), which it was designed to express. As all idolatry was regarded as devil worship (Le 17:7; De 32:17; Ps 106:37; 1Co 10:20), so there seems to have been something peculiarly satanic about the worship of this hateful god, which caused his name to be a synonym of Satan. Though we nowhere read that our Lord was actually called "Beelzebul," He was charged with being in league with Satan under that hateful name (Mt 12:24, 26), and more than once Himself was charged with "having a devil" or "demon" (Mr 3:30; Joh 7:20; 8:48). Here it is used to denote the most opprobrious language which could be applied by one to another.<p>how much more shall they call them of his household&#8212;"the inmates." Three relations in which Christ stands to His people are here mentioned: He is their Teacher&#8212;they His disciples; He is their Lord&#8212;they His servants; He is the Master of the household&#8212;they its inmates. In all these relations, He says here, He and they are so bound up together that they cannot look to fare better than He, and should think it enough if they fare no worse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 24,25. As much as if he had said, "Think not much if you meet with persecutions: I am your Lord and Master, you are my servants and household; you have no reason to look for better measure from the world than I your Lord meet with; it is honour enough for you to be used as well as I am. You know they have persecuted me, they call me Beelzebub, saying that I cast out devils by Beelzebub, the prince of devils. Why should you expect better?" Our Saviour used the same argument, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-40.htm" title="The disciple is not above his master: but every one that is perfect shall be as his master.">Luke 6:40</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Beelzebub</span> was the idol of Ekron, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2 Kings 1:2</a></span>. The word signifies, the lord of flies; either because they invoked his help against the flies, or (as others say) the name was in derision to that idol given by the Jews to the prince of the devils, because the places herein they sacrificed to it were infested with flies, which they say God’s temple at Jerusalem never was, notwithstanding the multitude of sacrifices which were there killed. Certain it is they understood by it the prince of devils. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master,.... A disciple should think himself very well off, be entirely satisfied, yea, abundantly thankful, if he meets with no worse treatment than his master; if he has the same honour done him his master has, this is more than could be expected by him; and if he has the same ill usage with his master, he need not wonder at it, but should solace himself with this consideration, that it is no other, nor worse than his master had before him: and the same is equally true in the other case, <p>and the servant as his Lord: these expressions, as before, were proverbs, or common sayings among the Jews, which our Lord chose to make use of, and adapt to his present purpose; , "vel"   , "it is enough for the servant, that he be as his master", is a saying often to be met with in their writings (i); which our Lord applies, and reasons upon, in the following manner: <p>if they have called the master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of the household? By "the master of the household"; he means himself, who is master of the family both in heaven and in earth; who is son over his own house, the high priest over the house of God, the lord and governor of all the household of faith; who takes care of, provides for, and protects all that are of God's household: and yet, though in such an high office, and of such great usefulness, he did not escape the severest lashes of the tongues of the wicked Jews; who called him by the most opprobrious names they could think of, and among the rest Beelzebub; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-24.htm">Matthew 12:24</a>. This was the god of the Ekronites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm">2 Kings 1:2</a>. The word signifies "a masterfly" or the "lord of a fly": and so the Septuagint there call him , "Baal the fly", the god of the Ekronites. And this idol was so called, either because it was in the form of a fly: or else from the abundance of flies about it, by reason of the sacrifices, which it was not able to drive away; and therefore the Jews contemptuously gave it this name. They observe (k), that in the temple, notwithstanding the multitude of sacrifices offered up there, there never was seen a fly in the slaughter house: or else this deity was so called from its being invoked to drive away flies, and the same with Myiodes, the god of flies, mentioned by Pliny (l), or Myagros, which the same author (m) speaks of; so Jupiter was called  a driver away of flies; as was also Hercules (n); and were worshipped by some nations on this account. In most copies, and so in the Arabic version, it is read Beelzebul; that is, as it is commonly rendered, the "lord of dung", or a dunghill god; and it is generally thought the Jews called the god of the Ekronites so, by way of contempt; as it was usual with them to call an idol's temple   "zebul", "dung", and worshipping of idols  "dunging" (o): but I must own, that I should rather think, that as Beelsamin, the god of the Phoenicians, is the same with Beelzebul, the god of the Ekronites, so it signifies the same thing: now , "Beelsamin", is "the lord of the heavens", and so is Beelzebul; for   "Zebul", signifies "heaven"; so the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/3-11.htm">Habakkuk 3:11</a> "the sun and the moon stood still",  "in their habitation"; by which, as a Jewish (p) writer observes,  , "is meant the heavens"; for they are the habitation of the sun and moon: see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-15.htm">Isaiah 63:15</a> and so among the seven names of the heavens, reckoned up by them, this is accounted one (q). Now as the Jews looked upon all the deities of the Gentiles as demons, or devils; and since Beelzebub was the chief of them, they thought they could not fix upon a more reproachful name, to give to Christ, than this: and our Lord suggests, that since the great master of the family was called in such an abusive manner, it should be no cause of stumbling and offence, if those of a lower class in the family should be so stigmatized; if Christians are called by ever such hard names, even devils, they should not be disturbed at it; since their lord and master was called the prince of them. <p>(i) T.

It is supposed, at the same time, that the name Beelzebub, the Philistine god of flies, by being changed into Beelzebul (god of dung), came to be employed, in a jocular way, as a name for the devil. See below on the reading <span class="greekheb">Βεελζεβούβ</span>. But, as against the meaning god of dung, there is (1) the form of the name itself, which, if derived from <span class="greekheb">זֶבֶל</span>, should have been spelt <span class="greekheb">Βεελζαβήλ</span>, or <span class="greekheb">Βεελζάβελ</span>, according to the analogy of <span class="greekheb">Ἰεζαβήλ</span> (<span class="greekheb">אִיזֶבֶל</span>), or <span class="greekheb">Ἰεζάβελ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>). (2) The fact that Jesus’ own designation of Himself as <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδεσπότης</span> is evidently chosen with reference to the meaning of <span class="greekheb">Βεελζεβούλ</span>, as indeed is clear from <span class="greekheb">δεσπότης</span> = <span class="greekheb">בעל</span>, and that, accordingly, the name <span class="greekheb">Βεελζεβούλ</span> must contain something corresponding to <span class="greekheb">οἶκος</span> as well. This being so, it is preferable to derive the word from <span class="greekheb">בַּעַל</span> and <span class="greekheb">זְבוּל</span>, a dwelling (Gusset, Michaelis, Paulus, Jahn, Hitzig, Philistäer, p. 314; Hilgenfeld, Volkmar), according to which the devil, as lord of his domain, in which the evil spirits dwell, was called Dominus domicilii (but neither tartari, as Paulus, nor domicilii coelestis, as Hilgenfeld, Keim, suppose). Jesus was, in relation to His disciples (<span class="greekheb">τοὺς οἰκιακοὺς αὐτοῦ</span>), the Herus domesticus, <span class="greekheb">בַּעַל הַבַּיִת</span> (Buxtorf, Lex. Talm. p. 333); but, in malicious jest, they applied to Him the corresponding name of the devil: Herus domicilii. Jerome wrote <span class="greekheb">Βεελζεβούβ</span>, from <span class="greekheb">זְבוּב</span>, musca, i.e. Dominus muscarum. Such was the name given to a fortune-telling divinity of the Ekronites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-2.htm" title="And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.">2 Kings 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-16.htm" title="And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.">2 Kings 1:16</a>), which during an illness was consulted by King Ahaziah, and to which, in connection with the very ancient heathen worship of flies, was ascribed the dominion over those insects, and which therefore was supposed, at the same time, to have the power of averting this scourge of the East.

Consult Meyer <span class="ital">ad loc.</span> Weiss (Meyer) remarks that the name of the Prince of the demons is not yet sufficiently explained. A question of interest is: did the enemies of Jesus call Him Beelzebul (or Beelzebub), or did they merely reproach Him with connection with Beelzebub? Weiss, taking <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-25.htm" title="It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and the servant as his lord.

The reading of Codex [66], <span class="greekheb">οἰκοδεσπότῃ</span>, favours the other alternative. The dative requires the verb <span class="greekheb">ἐπεκάλεσαν</span> to be taken in the sense of to cast up to one. Assuming that the evangelist reports words of Jesus instead of giving a comment of his own, they may quite well contain the information that, among the contemptuous epithets applied to Jesus by His enemies, was this name.

As the Greeks, however, seem to have been unable to pronounce the word <span class="ital">Beelzebub</span>, the LXX. rendered it <span class="greekheb">Βααλζεβούβ</span> (Baalmwian): and the Evangelists also wrote it in Greek with a <span class="greekheb">λ</span> (<span class="ital">l</span>), instead of a <span class="greekheb">β</span> (<span class="ital">b</span>), as the final letter, on account, apparently, not of the derivation, but the pronunciation; just as the LXX. wrote <span class="greekheb">Μελχὸλ</span> (<span class="ital">Melchol</span>) for Michal.

Jesus calls himself "the Master of the house," and the Jews apply to him the corresponding title of the Devil, Hebrews, Beelzebul, Master of the dwelling. (The phrase reappears in German, where the Devil is sometimes called Herr vom Haus. See Goethe, "Faust," sc. xxi.). Dr. Edersheim's explanation, though ingenious, seems far-fetched. He says that szebuhl, in Rabbinic language, means, not any ordinary dwelling, but specifically the temple ; so that Beelzebul would be Master of the Temple, an expression having reference to the claims of Jesus on his first purification of the temple. He then conceives a play between this word and Beelzibbul, meaning Lord of idolatrous sacrifice, and says: "The Lord of the temple was to them the chief of idolatrous worship; the representative of God, that of the worst of demons. Beelzebul was Beelzibbul. What, then, might his household expect at their hands?" ("Life and Times of Jesus"). </body></html>
