You are not even to provide the clothes and shoes which you may have occasion for before you return; because you shall be supplied with whatever you need by those to whom you preach the gospel. Our Lord forbade his disciples to provide beforehand such things as might be necessary during their journey, because they would be an encumbrance and would incommode them in travelling. He probably also ordered them to go out thus unfurnished, partly that they might be inured, in his own lifetime, to bear the hardships they would be exposed to afterward, when discharging the apostolical office; and partly that their faith in the providence of God might be confirmed. For it must have afforded them great comfort ever after, to reflect on the singular care that was taken of them while out on their first mission, wholly unprepared to execute such an undertaking. Accordingly this was the use which Christ himself directed them to make of it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-35.htm" title="And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and money, and shoes, lacked you any thing? And they said, Nothing.">Luke 22:35</a>. It may not be improper to observe here, that the word <span class="greekheb">ζωναις</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">purses, </span>properly means <span class="ital">girdles: </span>because the people in the East had a custom of carrying their money in a kind of fob-pocket, or fold, made in the duplicate of their girdles. The word <span class="greekheb">τηρα</span>, rendered <span class="ital">scrip, </span>was a sort of large bag, in which shepherds and those who journeyed carried their provisions. Thus the bag into which David put the smooth stones wherewith he smote Goliah, is called both a <span class="ital">scrip </span>and a <span class="ital">shepherd’s bag. </span>Our Lord, in saying, <span class="ital">Neither two coats nor shoes, </span>means that they were only to take one coat and one pair of shoes, that is, only the articles of raiment which they were wearing. “In the account which Mark gives of the repetition of these instructions, immediately before the disciples took their journey, he says, they were permitted to be <span class="ital">shod with sandals; </span>(<span class="greekheb">αλλ</span>’ <span class="greekheb">υποδεδεμενους σανδαλια</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-9.htm" title="After this manner therefore pray you: Our Father which are in heaven, Hallowed be your name.">Matthew 6:9</a>.) The sandal was a piece of strong leather or wood fastened to the sole of the foot with strings, which they tied round the foot and ankle; but the shoe was a kind of short boot, that covered the foot and part of the leg, and was a more delicate piece of dress than the sandal.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Nor yet staves </span>— Though in the margin we read, Gr. <span class="ital">a staff, </span>which is the common reading, many manuscripts and versions have <span class="greekheb">ραβδους</span>, <span class="ital">staves, </span>which some think reconciles this place with <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm" title="And he said to them, Take nothing for your journey, neither staves, nor money, neither bread, neither money; neither have two coats apiece.">Luke 9:3</a>; and removes the seeming contradiction from <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-8.htm" title="And commanded them that they should take nothing for their journey, save a staff only; no money, no bread, no money in their purse:">Mark 6:8</a>, where we read, <span class="ital">Take nothing save a staff only; </span>that is, as they explain it, he that had a staff might take it to walk with: but none of them were to take any sort of rod or staff besides, wherewith to defend themselves, because, being the servants of the Lord, they were to be defended by his power as well as supported by his bounty. But the more probable solution of the difficulty seems to be, any one of them that had a staff in his hand, might take it: but as for those who were walking without staves, they were not to provide them.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/10.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>10:5-15 The Gentiles must not have the gospel brought them, till the Jews have refused it. This restraint on the apostles was only in their first mission. Wherever they went they must proclaim, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. They preached, to establish the faith; the kingdom, to animate the hope; of heaven, to inspire the love of heavenly things, and the contempt of earthly; which is at hand, that men may prepare for it without delay. Christ gave power to work miracles for the confirming of their doctrine. This is not necessary now that the kingdom of God is come. It showed that the intent of the doctrine they preached, was to heal sick souls, and to raise those that were dead in sin. In proclaiming the gospel of free grace for the healing and saving of men's souls, we must above all avoid the appearance of the spirit of an hireling. They are directed what to do in strange towns and cities. The servant of Christ is the ambassador of peace to whatever place he is sent. His message is even to the vilest sinners, yet it behoves him to find out the best persons in every place. It becomes us to pray heartily for all, and to conduct ourselves courteously to all. They are directed how to act as to those that refused them. The whole counsel of God must be declared, and those who will not attend to the gracious message, must be shown that their state is dangerous. This should be seriously laid to heart by all that hear the gospel, lest their privileges only serve to increase their condemnation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/10.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/6-8.htm">Mark 6:8-11</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3-5</a>.

But the prohibition is directed not merely against possessing, but against <span class="ital">acquiring</span> (<span class="greekheb">κέκτημαι</span>, perfect = possess). The question is as to the scope of the prohibition. Does it refer merely to the way, or also to the mission? In one case it will mean: do not anxiously procure extensive provision for your journey (Meyer); in the other it will mean, more comprehensively: do not procure for the way, or during the mission, the things named. In other words, it will be an injunction to begin and carry on the mission without reward. Though the reference seems to be chiefly to the starting point, it must be in reality to their conduct during the mission. There was no need to say: do not obtain gold before starting, for that was practically impossible. There was need to say: do not take gold or silver from those whom you benefit, for it was likely to be offered, and acceptance of gifts would be morally prejudicial. That, therefore, is what Jesus prohibits, true to His habit of insisting on the supreme value of motive. So Jerome (condemnatio avaritiae), Chrys., Hilary, etc. So also Weiss. Holtz. (H.C.), while concurring in this interpretation, thinks the prohibition suits better the conduct of the <span class="ital">Christ-merchants</span> in the <span class="ital">Didache</span> than the circumstances of the disciples.—<span class="greekheb">χρυσὸν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἄργυρον</span>, <span class="greekheb">χαλκὸν</span>: an anticlimax, not gold, not silver, not even a copper.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὰς ζώνας</span>, in your girdles, used for this purpose as well as for gathering up the loose mantle, or in purses suspended from the girdle. “It was usual for travellers to carry purses (<span class="greekheb">φασκώλια</span>) suspended from their girdles in which they carried the pence” (Euthy.).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/10.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Provide neither gold</span>, &c.] The disciples must not furnish themselves with the ordinary equipment of an Eastern traveller.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">gold … silver … brass</span>] Of the three metals named the brass or copper represents the native currency.

There is no connotation of foresight in the word itself, but only of acquisition. Observe that the apostles are not forbidden to take what they already have. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' shows that travellers ordinarily took with them a staff, a purse, shoes, a wallet, and sometimes a book of the Law. <span class="cmt_word">Neither gold, nor silver, nor brass</span>. The <span class="accented">brass</span> would be the copper coinage of the Herods (examples are figured in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' 2. p. 413), which alone might be struck by them; or some of the Greek imperial coins, especially those struck at Antioch. The <span class="accented">silver</span>, either Greek imperial tetradrachms or Roman denarii of a quarter their weight, didrachms having fallen into disuse; only certain free cities were allowed to coin silver. The <span class="accented">gold</span>, as Palestine was a subject province, must have been coined at Rome, for she retained the coining of gold entirely in her own hands (cf. Madden's 'Coins of the Jews,' pp. 107, 290, ft., edit. 1881; and It. S. Peele, in Smith's 'Dict. of Bible,' <span class="accented">s.vv.</span> "Money," "Stater;" further, see ver. 29). <span class="cmt_word">In your purses</span>; literally, <span class="accented">girdles</span>, which in the East often serve as purses. This prohibition may have been suggested by the last words of ver. 8, but can hardly refer to them. It seems to regard the journey only (cf. parallel passages). <span class="cmt_word">Nor scrip</span>; no <span class="accented">wallet</span> (Revised Version). At the present time, "all shepherds have them, and they are the farmer's universal <span class="accented">vade-mecum.</span> They are merely the skins of kids stripped off whole, and tanned by a very simple process" (Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 345, edit. 1887, where a picture of one is given). But they might be made even of fish-skin (Mishna, 'Kelim,' 24:11). Because of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-40.htm">1 Samuel 17:40</a>, an haggada says that David's money was stamped with a staff and wallet on one side, and a tower on the other ('B'resh..R.,' &sect; 39, in Levy, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>  <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5e8;&#x5de;&#x5d9;&#x5dc;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">For your journey</span>. The clause is to be joined with "scrip" only. <span class="cmt_word">Neither two coats</span>. A second for sabbaths and festivals. For the rabbinic rule insisted upon a different coat for these days from that ordinarily worn. To the objection of poor disciples, that they had but one garment for sabbath and week-day alike, R. Samlai said that they must at least change the way in which they wore it (Talm. Jeremiah. 'Pea.,' 8:7 [S], in Hamburger, 'Realencycl.,' 2. p. 642. <span class="cmt_word">Neither shoes</span>. The parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-9.htm">Mark 6:9</a>, has. "but <span class="accented">to go</span> shod with sandals" (Revised Version). This is, perhaps, a case of verbal inaccuracy, but as it is impossible to suppose that our Lord can have wished his disciples to go without the ordinary protection to the feet, or that the author of this Gospel, accustomed, on any theory, to Eastern modes of life, can have intended to credit him with such a wish, some other explanation of the verbal discrepancy must be looked for. The true explanation is probably this - The rabbis insisted so strongly on a man never appearing barefooted: "Let a man sell the beams of his house and buy shoes for his feet" (Talm. Bab., 'Sabb.,' 129<span class="accented">a</span>), that it is very possible that a second pair was often carried in ease of need. it is this that our Lord forbids. On the other hand, Jews did not carry one pair for sabbath and another for week-days (Talm. Jeremiah, 'Sabb.,' 6:2). Some commentators escape the difficulty by distinguishing between "shoes" and "sandals;" but it is very doubtful if the usage of the words is always so exact that one term excludes the other. <span class="cmt_word">Nor yet staves</span>; <span class="accented">nor staff</span> (Revised Version). The plural, both here (Stephen) and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-3.htm">Luke 9:3</a> (Received Text), is a clumsy attempt to harmonize with <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6.htm">Mark 6</a>.8, where our Lord bids the twelve take nothing "save a staff only." The difference between the two reports of our Lord's words has been magnified by many commentators into a contradiction. But this is not the true state of the case. For it would be so extraordinary and apparently so useless an order to forbid their having a staff, that it is hard to suppose this to have been the meaning of his words as <span class="accented">reported</span> here. His thought in vers. 9, 10 is rather that they were to make no preparation, for their wants should be supplied, and that even if they had not a staff they were not to take the trouble to procure one. St. Mark's account only so far differs that he assumes that they will st least have a staff already. Observe, however, that no stress can be placed on the difference of the verbs here and in Mark, for in this respect Mark and Luke agree. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10b.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the workman</span>; <span class="accented">labourer</span> (Revised Version); thus connecting the utterance closely with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-37.htm">Matthew 9:37, 38</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Is worthy of his meat</span>. The disciples may therefore expect that it will be provided for them by those to whom they minister (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, of the seventy), and indirectly by the Master whom they serve (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-38.htm">Matthew 9:38</a>). <span class="accented">Meat</span>; <span class="accented">food</span> (Revised Version). In all but most highly organized systems of society, this is an important (frequently the most important) part of the day labourer's wages. Hence not unnaturally "<span class="accented">wages"</span> is found in the form of the sayings given by St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>) and St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-18.htm">1 Timothy 5:18</a>). Probably our Lord's words became a current proverb in Christian circles, the original word "<span class="accented">food"</span> being modified to suit the more general circumstances of life. Clem. Romans, &sect; 31, recalls the Matthaean form, "The good workman receiveth the bread of his work with boldness." Epiphanius gives a kind of confla-tion, containing the further thought that if the workman receives his food he must be content: "The workman is worthy of his hire, and sufficient to him that works is his food." Resch ('Agrapha,' pp. 97, 140) connects this form of the saying with the practice of giving only food to the travelling "apostles" and prophets of the sub-apostolic age ('Did.,' &sect; 11.). Professor Marshall (<span class="accented">Expositor</span>, IV. 2:76) suggests that if our Lord's original word was <span class="hebrew">&#x5e6;&#x5b5;&#x5d9;&#x5d3;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;</span>, it would explain the origin of both Matthew and Luke; but it seems very doubtful it' it really ever means "<span class="accented">wages."</span> Two patristic remarks are worth quoting: the first from Origen ('Cram. Cat.'), "In saying <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span>, ('food') he forbade <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> ('luxury');" the second from St. Gregory the Great (in Ford), "Priests ought to consider how criminal and punishable a thing it is to receive the fruit of labour, without labour." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/10.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Brass (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Properly copper.
