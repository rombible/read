She did not ask that the “children” might be deprived of any fragment of their portion; but taking her place, contentedly, among the “dogs,” she could still claim Him as her Master, and ask for the “crumbs” of His mercy. The Talmud contains a story so singularly parallel to this that it is worth reproducing. “There was a famine in the land, and stores of corn were placed under the care of Rabbi Jehudah the Holy, to be distributed to those only who were skilled in the knowledge of the Law. And, behold, a man came, Jonathan, the son of Amram, and clamorously asked for his portion. The Rabbi asked him whether he knew the condition, and had fulfilled it, and then the supplicant changed his tone, and said, ‘Nay, but feed me as a dog is fed, who eats of the crumbs of the feast,’ and the Rabbi hearkened to his words, and gave him of the corn.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:21-28 The dark corners of the country, the most remote, shall share Christ's influences; afterwards the ends of the earth shall see his salvation. The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; and though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not therefore be driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instance of mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads not merit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially for their souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a proud devil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at his will? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession, and you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone is able to heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially of his grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may be explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love in Christ's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encourages us, though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whom Christ intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their own unworthiness. A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; but she turned it into an argument to support her request. The state of this woman is an emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul. The least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honours Christ most; therefore of all graces Christ honours faith most. He cured her daughter. He spake, and it was done. From hence let such as seek help from the Lord, and receive no gracious answer, learn to turn even their unworthiness and discouragements into pleas for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And she said, Truth, Lord ... - What you say is true.<p>Let it be that the best food should be given to the children - let the Jews have the chief benefit of thy ministry; but the dogs beneath the table eat the crumbs.

She goeth on after three repulses, the last of which was not without a reproach, for our Lord had implicitly called her a dog. These words are as much as if she had said, Lord, I confess the Jews are children; I am a dog, a poor heathen, no proper member of the household of God; and it is truth that it seemeth unreasonable that I, being a dog, should be served before all the children are filled. Lord, I do not beg such a full manifestation of thy power and goodness for the Gentiles. I beg but a crumb of mercy for myself and poor child; and, Lord, though we do not use to give our loaves prepared for our children to the dogs that feed under our table, crumbs of our children’s bread, as Mark expresses it, yet we suffer our dogs to gather them up. Lord, I know thou hast a plenty of grace and blessing, the children may be filled, and yet I may have some crumbs. Three things are remarkable in her answer, besides her faith so eminently expressed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Her humility; she owneth herself a dog. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Her modesty; she begs no more than a crumb. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Her fervency and importunity after three repulses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By this we learn our duty in prayer, to go to God humbly, to implore him modestly, and to be instant in prayer, going on in our duty, though we have not presently such an answer as we desire. These things, conjoined with faith, make an acceptable prayer. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And she saith, truth, Lord,.... She owns all that he had said to be true, that he was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel: that she was indeed but a dog, a poor sinful creature, and unworthy of any favour; and that it was not right and fitting that all the children's bread should be taken from them and given to dogs: <p>yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table. The Syriac and Persic versions add "and live": thus she wisely lays hold upon and improves in a very beautiful manner, in her own favour, what seemed to be so much against her. It is observed (q) of the Syrophoenicians in general, that they have all, in their common talk, something   "pleasant and graceful", as there is indeed in this smart reply of her's, who was one of that people. She suggests that though the Gentiles were but dogs, and she one of them; yet their common Lord and Master had a propriety in them, and they in him; and were to be maintained and fed, and ought to live, though not in such fulness of favours and blessings, as the Jews, the children of God: nor did she desire their affluence, only that a crumb of mercy might be given her, that her poor daughter might be healed; which was but a small favour, in comparison of the numerous ones he heaped upon the children, the Jews: nor would this be any more detrimental to them, than it is to the children, for the dogs, under the table, to eat of the crumbs that fall. <p>(q) Eunapius in Vita Libanii. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/15.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ναί</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-9.htm" title="But what went you out for to see?

Zigabenus, Erasmus, Maldonatus); and <span class="greekheb">καὶ γάρ</span> means, as everywhere in the New Testament, and even to a far greater extent among classical writers (who use it but rarely in the sense of <span class="ital">namque</span>,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καί</span> consequently is connective), <span class="ital">for even</span>; see especially, Kühner, II. 2, p. 855. It gives a reason for the <span class="greekheb">ναί</span>; but it is quite according to rule to regard <span class="greekheb">τὰ κυνάρια</span> as the expression to which <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is meant to give prominence. Consequently the passage would run thus: <span class="ital">Yes, Lord</span>, Thou art right in what Thou sayest, <span class="ital">for even the dogs eat of the crumbs</span>, and so on; or, to express it negatively (with <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ γάρ</span>): for <span class="ital">even the dogs</span> are not sent away empty, and so on. That is to say, this <span class="greekheb">καί</span>, so far as can be seen from the context, cannot be intended to serve any other purpose than to suggest <span class="ital">a comparison</span> between the <span class="greekheb">κυνάρια</span> and the <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>, so that the passage may be paraphrased as follows: <span class="ital">Thou art right, Lord; for</span> not merely the <span class="ital">children</span> are filled with bread at the family-meal, but—so richly is the table spread—<span class="ital">even the dogs</span> receive their share, inasmuch as they <span class="ital">eat of the fragments</span>, and so on. It would therefore be but the more unseemly to take the <span class="ital">children’s</span> bread and cast it to the dogs, so as possibly to leave the former unfed. But in thus justifying her <span class="greekheb">ναὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>, the woman seeks to suggest the inference to our Lord that He might yet venture to give her <span class="ital">that</span> which is hinted at in those <span class="greekheb">ψιχία</span> with which the <span class="greekheb">κυνάρια</span> have to be contented. Of course by this she means a share of His abundant mercy, after the wants of Israel have been fully supplied. Following Grotius and Kuinoel, de Wette explains incorrectly: <span class="ital">For it is even usual for the dogs to get nothing but the fragments</span>. In that case we should have expected to find: <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ ἀπὸ τῶν ψιχίων ἐσθίει</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Fritzsche (comp. Bleek, Schegg) is likewise wrong when he explains thus: <span class="ital">Yes, Lord, it is allowable to give the bread to the dogs, for</span>, and so on. As against this view we have not merely <span class="greekheb">ναί</span>, which can only be taken as a <span class="ital">confirming</span>, a justifying of what Jesus had said, not simply the ignoring of <span class="greekheb">καὶ γάρ</span>, which it would involve, but also the “repugnandi audacia,” which is not to be excused in consideration of the <span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>, and the meaning itself, which would certainly not bear out the idea of a contradiction on the part of the woman. But if there is one thing more than another that must not be associated with the tender language of this woman, it is the appearance of anything like contradiction. Finally, all interpretations are wrong which would necessitate our having <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">καὶ γάρ</span> (Chrysostom, Luther, Vatablus, Glöckler, Baumgarten-Crusius).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason why we find Jesus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-26.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.">Matthew 15:26</a>, and consequently the woman also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>, making use of the <span class="ital">diminutive</span> <span class="greekheb">κυνάρια</span> (a classical term, Plat. <span class="ital">Euthyd</span>. p. 298 D; Xen. <span class="ital">Cyr</span>. viii. 4. 20, although discarded by Phrynichus, p. 180), is because His idea is that of a <span class="ital">family-meal</span>, in connection with which it was not unnatural to think of the little <span class="ital">house-dogs</span> that ran about under the table (comp. <span class="greekheb">τραπεζῆες κύνες</span>, Hom. <span class="ital">Il</span>. xxiii. 173). The <span class="ital">plural</span> <span class="greekheb">τῶν κυρίων</span> may be ascribed to the fact that, in what she says, the woman is understood to be stating what is matter of general experience.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-27.htm" title="And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table.">Matthew 15:27</a>. <span class="greekheb">ναί</span>, <span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>· <span class="greekheb">καὶ γὰρ</span>, etc.: eager assent, not dissent, with a gleam in the eye on perceiving the advantage given by the comparison = Yes, indeed, Lord, for even, etc. Kypke cites an instance from Xenophon of the combination <span class="greekheb">ναί καὶ γὰρ</span> in the same sense.—<span class="greekheb">ψιχίων</span>, dimin. from <span class="greekheb">ψίξ</span>, a bit, crumb, found only in N.

R.), another diminutive answering to <span class="greekheb">κυνάρια</span> = the little pet dogs, eat of the minute morsels. Curiously felicitous combination of ready wit, humility and faith: wit in seizing on the playful <span class="greekheb">κυνάρια</span> and improving on it by adding <span class="greekheb">ψιχία</span>, humility in being content with the smallest crumbs, faith in conceiving of the healing asked as only such a crumb for Jesus to give.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">27</span>. <span class="ital">yet the dogs eat of the crumbs</span>] “Yet,” of the E.

She asks for it as a favour, essential to herself, injurious to no one.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span>, <span class="ital">from</span>).

Her nation was contiguous to Israel.—<span class="greekheb">τῶν κυρίων αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">of their masters</span>) This indicates the prerogative of the <span class="ital">children</span>, and vet a certain tie of connection (necessitudinem) with them on the part of the <span class="ital">little dogs</span>.

Christ's answer might have seemed the climax of rejection, and to have at once closed the matter forever. But her love for her daughter, and her growing faith in Jesus, overcame all seeming hindrances. With a woman's ready wit, quickened by urgency and affection, she seizes the opportunity, and turns Christ's own words against himself. Thou sayest truth, she means; the Jews are the children; we are the dogs; and as dogs we claim our portion. This we can receive without defrauding the children of any of their food. <span class="cmt_word">Yet</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>, or <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;</span>, <span class="accented">for even</span>; <span class="accented">nam et</span> (Vulgate). The Authorized Version injures the significance of the mother's reply, as if there were something adversative in the particles, which really introduce the confirmation of her assent. <span class="cmt_word">The dogs eat of the crumbs,</span> etc. Dogs in the East have access to the rooms, and live on what they can pick up or on what is thrown to them. The fragments at meals were naturally numerous, the abundance being occasioned by the nature of the food, the use of fingers instead of spoons and forks, and the employment of pieces of bread as platters and napkins. We may paraphrase the Canaanite's reply thus: By calling us dogs, you virtually grant what I desire. You can do what I wish without infringing your rule, in the justice of which I humbly acquiesce. I claim nothing as a daughter of Abraham; I look only for uncovenanted mercies; I ask only for that portion which falls to the lot of the creatures which hold the lowest place in the household, and the loss of which will never be felt. Truly by humbling her Jesus educated her, taught her that her real plea was her unworthiness, that in acknowledgment of her degradation lay the force of her appeal. And in asking for this one act of mercy she is doing no wrong to the sons of the house. </body></html>
