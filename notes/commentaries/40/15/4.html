He had called on men to forsake father and mother for the sake of the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-18.htm" title="And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea: for they were fishers.">Matthew 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-22.htm" title="And they immediately left the ship and their father, and followed him.">Matthew 4:22</a>), and had excluded from discipleship those who loved father and mother more than they loved Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-37.htm" title="He that loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me: and he that loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:37</a>). We need not close our eyes to the difficulty which thus presents itself. But the answer is not far to seek. In our Lord’s teaching, a lower, natural duty was to give way exceptionally to a higher and supernatural one; otherwise it remained in full force. In that of the Pharisees the natural duty, enforced by a direct divine commandment, was made to give way to one which was purely human, arbitrary, and conventional. The two cases were not only not analogous, but stood on an entirely different footing.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-9 Additions to God's laws reflect upon his wisdom, as if he had left out something which was needed, and which man could supply; in one way or other they always lead men to disobey God. How thankful ought we to be for the written word of God! Never let us think that the religion of the Bible can be improved by any human addition, either in doctrine or practice. Our blessed Lord spoke of their traditions as inventions of their own, and pointed out one instance in which this was very clear, that of their transgressing the fifth commandment. When a parent's wants called for assistance, they pleaded, that they had devoted to the temple all they could spare, even though they did not part with it, and therefore their parents must expect nothing from them. This was making the command of God of no effect. The doom of hypocrites is put in a little compass; In vain do they worship me. It will neither please God, nor profit themselves; they trust in vanity, and vanity will be their recompence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God commanded ... - That is, in the fifth commandment <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>. To "honor" is to obey, to reverence, to speak kindly to, to speak and think well of. To "curse" is to disobey, to treat with irreverence, to swear at, to speak ill of, to think evil of in the heart, to meditate or do any evil to a parent. All this is included in the original word.<p>Let him die the death - This is a Hebrew phrase, the same as saying, "let him surely die." The Jewish law punished this crime with death. This duty of honoring and obeying a parent was what Christ said they had violated by their traditions. He proceeds to state the way in which it was done.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

That he might not be thought to suggest this without any foundation, he gives them an instance, wherein a command of God was transgressed, by the observance of their tradition: the command he refers to, stands in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a> and is this; <p>Honour thy father and mother. This was a plain command of God, written with his own hand, and delivered by Moses to them; it was of a moral nature, and of eternal obligation: and to be understood, not merely of that high esteem parents are to be had in by their children, and of the respectful language and gesture to be used towards them, and of the cheerful obedience to be yielded to them; but also of honouring them with their substance, feeding, clothing, and supplying them with the necessaries of life, when they stand in need thereof; which is but their reasonable service, for all the care, expense, and trouble they have been at, in bringing them up in the world: nor did the Jews deny this to be the duty of children to their parents, and own it to be the sense of the commandment: they say (p), that this is the weightiest commandment among the weighty ones, even this, the honouring of father and mother; and ask, <p>"What is this honour? To which is replied, he must give him food, drink, and clothing; buckle his shoes, and lead him in, and bring him out.'' <p>They indeed laid down this as a rule, and it seems a very equitable one (q); that, <p>"when a man's father has any money, or substance, he must be supported out of that; but if he has none, he must support him out of his own.'' <p>But then, as will be seen hereafter, they made void this command of God, and their own explications of it, by some other tradition. Moreover, Christ observes, that it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a><p>And he that curseth father or mother, let him die the death; temporal and eternal: and which is a positive command of God, made as a fence for the former; and is to be understood, not only of giving abusive language to parents, but of slighting, as the Hebrew word signifies, and neglecting them, taking no notice of them, when needy and in distress, to supply their wants. Now these commands of God, Christ shows the Jews transgressed by their tradition, as appears from the following verses. <p>(p) T. Hieros. Kiddushin, fol. 61. 2.((q) Piske Toseph. ad T. Bab.

Christ cites the fifth commandment, because it more especially appealed to the conscience of every one, and was emphasized by the solemn enactment of death as the penalty of its infringement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Honour</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>).
