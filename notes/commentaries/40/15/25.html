She had apparently stood apart during the conversation between the Prophet and His disciples, and now came again, renewing her passionate entreaty.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:21-28 The dark corners of the country, the most remote, shall share Christ's influences; afterwards the ends of the earth shall see his salvation. The distress and trouble of her family brought a woman to Christ; and though it is need that drives us to Christ, yet we shall not therefore be driven from him. She did not limit Christ to any particular instance of mercy, but mercy, mercy, is what she begged for: she pleads not merit, but depends upon mercy. It is the duty of parents to pray for their children, and to be earnest in prayer for them, especially for their souls. Have you a son, a daughter, grievously vexed with a proud devil, an unclean devil, a malicious devil, led captive by him at his will? this is a case more deplorable than that of bodily possession, and you must bring them by faith and prayer to Christ, who alone is able to heal them. Many methods of Christ's providence, especially of his grace, in dealing with his people, which are dark and perplexing, may be explained by this story, which teaches that there may be love in Christ's heart while there are frowns in his face; and it encourages us, though he seems ready to slay us, yet to trust in him. Those whom Christ intends most to honour, he humbles to feel their own unworthiness. A proud, unhumbled heart would not have borne this; but she turned it into an argument to support her request. The state of this woman is an emblem of the state of a sinner, deeply conscious of the misery of his soul. The least of Christ is precious to a believer, even the very crumbs of the Bread of life. Of all graces, faith honours Christ most; therefore of all graces Christ honours faith most. He cured her daughter. He spake, and it was done. From hence let such as seek help from the Lord, and receive no gracious answer, learn to turn even their unworthiness and discouragements into pleas for mercy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>She came and worshipped - That is, bowed down to him or did him reverence.<p>See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-2.htm">Matthew 8:2</a>.<p>Lord, help me! - A proper cry for a poor sinner, who needs the help of the Lord Jesus.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

She followed the disciples into the house; and perceiving another repulse by Christ's answer to them, she pushes on, through all discouragements; her faith grows stronger, and her importunity greater: she had called Christ Lord, and the son of David before, but now she worships him as God: <p>Saying, Lord help me; a short petition, but what fully and fitly expressed her case: the object she prays unto is the Lord, by which she owns his sovereignty, dominion, and power: the request she makes is for "help", signifying that her case required it; that it was such, that she could not help herself, nor any creature help her, only he, which she firmly believed; and though it was her daughter, and not she herself, that was so miserably afflicted; yet such was her sympathy, love, and affection to her, that she makes the case her own, and calls helping her daughter, helping herself; for her daughter being relieved, she would be made easy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/15.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/15-25.htm" title="Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me....">Matthew 15:25-28</a>. <span class="ital">Entreaty renewed at close quarters with success</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/15.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-25.htm" title="Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.">Matthew 15:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐλθοῦσα</span>, <span class="ital">coming</span>) sc. in front of the Saviour from behind Him;[696] although He appeared to have given a repulse even to His disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[696] Thereby stopping up the way before Him [as if she would not let Him go farther without blessing her].—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Came she and worshipped him.</span> Meantime, as we learn from St. Mark, Jesus had left the street and entered into a house. The woman, nothing daunted by her rebuff and the disregard with which her appeal was received, followed him persistently, and, growing bolder in her importunity, fell as a suppliant at his feet. While he still seemed to repulse her, she was learning fresh faith and hope. <span class="cmt_word">Lord, help me.</span> She does not now call him "Son of David." She begins to feel that she has little claim upon him as the Jewish Messiah; she appeals rather to his mercy and his power. Still, she identifies herself, as at first, with her daughter; the only boon she wants for herself is her child's relief. "For she indeed (my daughter) is insensible of her disease, but it is I that suffer her innumerable woes; my disease is with consciousness, my madness with perception of itself" (St. Chrysostom, 'Hom. 52 in S. Matt.'). </body></html>
