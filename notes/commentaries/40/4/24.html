Our Lord’s ministry, with the one exception of the journey to the coasts of Tyre and Sidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-21.htm" title="Then Jesus went there, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon.">Matthew 15:21</a>), was confined to what is commonly known as Palestine. Traces of the wider fame are, however, found in the mention of hearers from Idumæa, and Tyre, and Sidon among the crowds that followed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-8.htm" title="And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and from beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came to him.">Mark 3:8</a>); in the faith of the Syro-Phœnician woman in His power to heal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/7-26.htm" title="The woman was a Greek, a Syrophenician by nation; and she sought him that he would cast forth the devil out of her daughter.">Mark 7:26</a>); perhaps in the existence of disciples at Damascus so soon after the Ascension (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>); perhaps, also, in St. Peter’s appeal to the friends of Cornelius at Cæsarea, as knowing already the broad facts of our Lord’s ministry and miraculous working (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-37.htm" title="That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;">Acts 10:37</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Possessed with devils. . . . lunatick.</span>—The phenomena of what is called possession, and the theories to which the phenomena have been referred, will best be discussed in dealing with the great representative instance of the Gadarene demoniacs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>). Here it will be enough to notice (1) that the word rendered “devil” is not the same as that used for the Tempter in 4:1, but “demon” in the sense of an evil spirit, (2) that the possessed with demons are at once grouped with the “lunaticks,” both exhibiting forms of mental disease, and distinguished from them. The latter term implies in the Greek, as in the Latin and our own, “moonstruck madness”—the belief that the moon exercised a disturbing influence on the brain (a <span class= "ital">coup de lune</span> being dreaded by Eastern travellers almost as much as a <span class= "ital">coup de soleil</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> and that the intensity of the disturbance varied, when the disease had once set in, with the moon’s changes.<p><span class= "bld">Those that had the palsy.</span>—Here the word (literally, <span class= "ital">the paralytics</span>) points, not to a view of the cause of the disease, but to its conspicuous phenomena—the want of muscular power to control motion, and the consequent “looseness,” in popular phraseology, of limbs or head.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.">Matthew 4:24</a></span>. <span class="ital">His fame went through all Syria </span>— Of which the country of the Jews and Samaritans was but a small part. Pliny tells us, that Syria contained several provinces, Comagene to the north, Phœnicia to the west, Cœlosyria to the south, Palmyrene, and the province of Seleucia, in the middle part. If, by all Syria, the evangelist means all these different provinces of Syria, our Lord’s fame must at this time have been exceedingly great. Nor is there any thing incredible in the evangelist’s affirmation, taken in the largest sense. For considering the number and greatness of the miracles which he performed, it would not have been beyond belief, had the historian told us that the fame of them reached as far as the communication of the Jews with the rest of the world extended. <span class="ital">And they brought unto him those that were possessed with devils, and those lunatic, and those that had the palsy </span>— These are justly reckoned cases of as great misery, and of as little hope, as any to be found among men.

We do not now find the Saviour's miraculous healing power in our bodies; but if we are cured by medicine, the praise is equally his. Three general words are here used. He healed every sickness or disease; none was too bad; none too hard, for Christ to heal with a word. Three diseases are named; the palsy, which is the greatest weakness of the body; lunacy, which is the greatest malady of the mind; and possession of the devil, which is the greatest misery and calamity of both; yet Christ healed all, and by thus curing bodily diseases, showed that his great errand into the world was to cure spiritual maladies. Sin is the sickness, disease, and torment of the soul: Christ came to take away sin, and so to heal the soul.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And his fame went throughout all Syria - It is not easy to fix the exact bounds of Syria in the time of our Saviour. It was, perhaps, the general name for the country lying between the Euphrates on the east, and the Mediterranean on the west; and between Mount Taurus on the north, and Arabia on the south. Through all this region his celebrity was spread by his power of working miracles; and, as might be expected, the sick from every quarter were brought to him, in the hope that he would give relief.<p>Those possessed with devils - Much difficulty exists, and much has been written respecting those in the New Testament said to be possessed with the devil. It has been maintained by many that the sacred writers only meant by this expression to denote those who were melancholy or epileptic, or afflicted with some other grievous disease. This opinion has been supported by arguments too long to be repeated here. On the other hand, it has been supposed that the persons so described were under the influence of evil spirits, who had complete possession of the faculties, and who produced many symptoms of disease not unlike melancholy, madness, and epilepsy. That such was the fact will appear from the following considerations:<p>1. Christ and the apostles spoke to them and of them as such; they addressed them, and managed them, precisely as if they were so possessed, leaving their hearers to infer beyond a doubt that such was their real opinion.<p>2. Those who were thus possessed spake, conversed, asked questions, gave answers, and expressed their knowledge of Christ, and their fear of him things that certainly could not be said of diseases, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm">Matthew 8:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27</a>.<p>3. The devils, or evil spirits, are represented as going out of the persons possessed, and entering the bodies of others, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-32.htm">Matthew 8:32</a>.<p>4. Jesus spake to them, and asked their name, and they answered him. He threatened them, commanded them to be silent, to depart, and not to return, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-25.htm">Mark 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-8.htm">Mark 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-25.htm">Mark 9:25</a>.<p>5. Those possessed are said "to know Christ; to be acquainted with the Son of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-34.htm">Luke 4:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-24.htm">Mark 1:24</a>. This could not be said of diseases.<p>6. The early fathers of the Church interpreted these passages in the same way. They derived their opinions probably from the apostles themselves, and their opinions are a fair interpretation of the apostles' sentiments.<p>7. If it is denied that Christ believed in such possessions, it does not appear why any other clearly-expressed sentiment of his may not in the same way be disputed. There is, perhaps, no subject on which he expressed himself more clearly, or acted more uniformly, or which he left more clearly impressed on the minds of his disciples.<p>Nor is there any absurdity in the opinion that those persons were really under the influence of devils. For:<p>1. It is no more absurd to suppose that an angel, or many angels, should have fallen and become wicked than that so many people should.<p>2. It is no more absurd that Satan should have possession of the human faculties, or inflict diseases, than that people should do it a thing which is done every day. What is more common than for a wicked man to corrupt the morals of others, or, by inducing them to become intemperate, to produce a state of body and mind quite as bad as to be possessed with the devil?<p>3. We still see a multitude of cases that no man can prove not to be produced by the presence of an evil spirit. Who would attempt to say that some evil being may not have much to do in the case of madmen?<p>4. It afforded an opportunity for Christ to show his power over the enemies of himself and of man, and thus to evince himself qualified to meet every enemy of the race, and triumphantly to redeem his people. He came to destroy the power of Satan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-18.htm">Acts 26:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/16-20.htm">Romans 16:20-21</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24.

Those<p>that were taken&#8212;for this is a distinct class, not an explanation of the "unwell" class, as our translators understood it.<p>with divers diseases and torments&#8212;that is, acute disorders.<p>and those which were possessed with devils&#8212;that were demonized or possessed with demons.<p>and those which were lunatic&#8212;moon-struck.<p>and those that had the palsy&#8212;paralytics, a word not naturalized when our version was made.<p>and he healed them&#8212;These healings were at once His credentials and illustrations of "the glad tidings" which He proclaimed. After reading this account of our Lord's first preaching tour, can we wonder at what follows?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Syria</span> is said to be bounded on the north by Cilicia, by Egypt on the south, on the west with the sea, and on the east with Euphrates, and to comprehend within it all Judea, Bethany, Galilee, Decapolis, Samaria, Idumea, Palestina, Syrophoenicia, Syria of Damascus, and Syria of Antioch. Christ’s fame spread very far doubtless, because of the good he did, and the miracles he wrought, <span class="ital">and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases:</span> ‘all’ here again can signify no more than very many that were indisposed and ill affected as to their bodily health, those that were sick of, or detained in their beds or houses by, divers diseases. Though Christ showed his power in curing some diseases which physicians judge incurable, yet he showed his kindness also in relieving others not so fatally sick. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And torments; </span> such as were troubled with great pains, as if they were upon racks, or in the hands of tormentors, that set themselves to torture them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And those which were possessed with devils:</span> of these sorts of persons we shall read often in the gospel: this is the first time we meet with the term. It is observed that in the Old Testament we read little of any such persons; (we read only of Saul’s being vexed with an evil spirit); we read much of them in the New Testament, and in ecclesiastical history for some years after Christ: they called them <span class="ital">energumeni.</span> Some think God, in those first times of the gospel, permitted the devil to this degree, that the power of our Saviour might be the more seen in casting them out, and in giving authority to his disciples to cast them out, which was a great demonstration of his Divinity. Others think that God did it for a demonstration of the error of the Sadducees, who held there were no spirits. The gospel seemeth to hint two sorts of these persons: some upon whom the devil had power no further than to rack and torture them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/5-3.htm" title="Who had his dwelling among the tombs; and no man could bind him, no, not with chains:...">Mark 5:3-5</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-39.htm" title="And, see, a spirit takes him, and he suddenly cries out; and it tears him that he foams again, and bruising him hardly departs from him.">Luke 9:39</a></span>; others in whom he dwelled bodily, and divined and prophesied in them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain damsel possessed with a spirit of divination met us, which brought her masters much gain by soothsaying:">Acts 16:16</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And those which were lunatic; </span> affected with such diseases as use to increase in some times of the moon, or at such times to seize persons: of this nature we know divers, more particularly the falling sickness and dropsy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And those that had the palsy, </span> a disease caused by the resolution of the nerves. Those diseases are mentioned which men account hardest to be cured, if capable of cure by men: Christ, to show his Divine power, healed them. Christ did not only cure these bodily distempers, but he also preached the gospel of the kingdom to heal their soul distempers. We read of many who came to him for bodily cure, but of none that said to him: <span class="ital">What shall we do to be saved?</span> How sensible are men and women of their bodily pains and diseases, more than of their soul’s wants! <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And his fame went throughout all Syria,.... For his ministry and miracles, especially the latter; wherefore <p>they brought to him, that is, out of Syria, the sick. Syria was in some respects reckoned as the land of Israel, though in others not. <p>"The (m) Rabbins teach, that in three respects Syria was like to the land of Israel, and in three to the countries with out the land: the dust defiled, as without the land; he that sold his servant to (one in) Syria, was as if he sold him to one without the land; and he that brought a bill of divorce from Syria, as if he brought it from without the land: and in three things it was like to the land of Israel; it was bound to tithes, and to the observance of the seventh year; and he that would go into it, might go into it with purity and he that purchased a field in Syria, was as if he had purchased one in the suburbs of Jerusalem.'' <p>All sick people, that were taken with divers diseases and torments. This expresses in general, the grievous and tormenting diseases with which the persons were afflicted, who were brought to Christ for healing: some particular ones follow; <p>and those which were possessed with devils; in body as well as in mind; of which there were many instances, permitted by God on purpose, that Christ might have an opportunity of showing his power over those evil spirits. <p>And those which were lunatic; either melancholy persons, or mad and distracted men; that retired from the conversation of men, into fields or desert places: or such, whose disorders were influenced by the change of the moon; such as those who are troubled with the falling sickness; so the Greeks (n) call such persons the word here used by the Evangelist. <p>And those that had the palsy.

They were real sick persons with diseases of a peculiar character (mania, epilepsy, delirium, hypochondria, paralytic condition, temporary dumbness), whose sufferings, being apparently inexplicable from physical causes, were believed to have their foundation not in an abnormal organization, or in natural disturbances of the physical condition, but in diabolical possession—that is, in the actual indwelling of demoniac personalities, very many of which might even be counted in one sick person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-9.htm" title="And he asked him, What is your name?

Comp. Ewald, <span class="ital">Jahrb</span>. VII. p. 54 ff., also Bleek, Neander, p. 237 ff. If we assume, however, that <span class="ital">Jesus Himself</span> shared the opinion of His age and nation regarding the reality of demoniacal possession of the sick (Strauss, Keim, Weiss), we find ourselves in the dilemma of either being obliged again to set up the old doctrine upon the authority of Jesus, or of attributing to the latter an erroneous belief not by any means remote from the religious sphere, and only of a physiological kind, but of an essentially religious character, and which would be irreconcilable with the pure height of the Lord’s divine knowledge.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ σελην</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">παραλυτ</span>.] <span class="ital">Epileptics</span>, whose sufferings, it was observed, increased as the month advanced (Wetstein), and <span class="ital">sufferers from nervous diseases</span> (Richter, <span class="ital">de paralysi</span>, 1775).

Becker (<span class="ital">bezauberte Welt</span>, iv. 5 ff.), Mead (<span class="ital">medica sacra</span>, ix.), Wetstein, been, especially by Semler (<span class="ital">Comment. de daemoniacis</span>, 1760, <span class="ital">u. umständliche Untersuch. d. dämonischen Leute</span>, 1762), successfully refuted, and had disappeared altogether (see also Timmermaim, <span class="ital">de daemoniac. evangelior</span>. 1786; Winzer, <span class="ital">de daemonologia N. T.</span>, 1812, 1821), although attempts at its defence were not wanting (Storr, <span class="ital">Opusc</span>. I. p. 53 ff.; Eschenmayer, <span class="ital">Mysticism</span>, 1823; Jahn, <span class="ital">Nachträge zu s. theol. Werken</span>, 1821), the old view was again brought forward, partly before (v. Meyer, <span class="ital">Bibeldut</span>. p. 40 ff.; Olshausen on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-28.htm" title="And when he was come to the other side into the country of the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass by that way.">Matthew 8:28</a>, and others), partly after, the assaults of Strauss (Krabbe, Hoffmann, Ebrard, Arnoldi, Hofmann, Steinmeyer), and supported with more or less acuteness, and with turns of a partly obscure and evasive character, especially by means of comparisons with magnetism. Delitzsch, <span class="ital">bibl. Psychol</span>. p. 293 ff.; Ebrard in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encykl</span>. III. p. 240 ff. Not so, however, Lange, 11. 1, p. 285 ff., who, regarding the condition as a natural one, refers it to a <span class="ital">nervous</span> disease, having an <span class="ital">elective affinity</span> with demoniacal influences, which the patient as well as the people represented to himself as possession. By this the old view is not retained even in appearance. Against its tenability, however, irrespective of all objections of a physiological and medical kind, the following are decisive proofs: (1) The non-occurrence of demons in the O. T.; (2) the undisputed healing of the same by exorcists (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-27.htm" title="And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.">Matthew 12:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-38.htm" title="And John answered him, saying, Master, we saw one casting out devils in your name, and he follows not us: and we forbade him, because he follows not us.">Mark 9:38</a>; Josephus, <span class="ital">Antt</span>. viii. 2. 5; Justin, <span class="ital">c.

In John, moreover, diabolical possession is found mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-27.htm" title="So the servants of the householder came and said to him, Sir, did not you sow good seed in your field? from where then has it tares?">Matthew 13:27</a>), but not as the effect of physical sickness, but of spiritual domination and obduracy, the so-called <span class="ital">obsessio spiritualis</span>.

The distinguishing feature of such demoniacal possession may be described as the phenomenon of double consciousness. The occult spiritual power becomes, as it were, a second self, ruling and checking the better self. The Greek word in the text, lit. <span class="bld">subject to a dæmon or dæmonion</span>, has no precise English equivalent. The word “devil” should be confined to the translation of <span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span>, see note, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm" title="Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil.">Matthew 4:1</a>.

The origin of mental disease may often be traced to licentious living. Observe the frequent instances of unclean spirits met with in these districts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Christian Church has followed her divine Founder’s example in this tendance of bodily ailment. The founding of hospitals and the care of the sick are distinguishing features of Christianity and among the most blessed fruits of it.

Possibly this was so, but the spirit of Judaism in this respect was not the spirit of Christianity. It may readily be acknowledged, however, that the Jews of the present day are the foremost in works of charity and tender regard for the sick.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-24.htm" title="And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought to him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and those which were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he healed them.">Matthew 4:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπῆλθεν</span>, <span class="ital">went out thence</span>) sc. afar.—<span class="greekheb">ἀκοὴ</span>, <span class="ital">fame</span>) The LXX. frequently render <span class="greekheb">שמעה</span>[162]<span class="greekheb"> </span>by <span class="greekheb">ἀκοὴ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">Συρίαν</span>, <span class="ital">Syria</span>) The province of which Palestine was considered a part.—<span class="greekheb">ΠΡΟΣΉΝΕΓΚΑΝ ΑὐΤῷ</span>, <span class="ital">they brought unto Him</span>) Even the Syrians did so.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς κακῶς ἔχοντας</span>, <span class="ital">those who were ill</span>)[163] The miracles of Jesus Christ were performed for the good[164] of men.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-2.htm" title="And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his miracles which he did on them that were diseased.">John 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm" title="The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and the poor have the gospel preached to them.">Matthew 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>.—<span class="greekheb">δαιμονιζομένους</span>, <span class="ital">possessed with devils</span>) The sick and the possessed are frequently mentioned together.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-16.htm" title="There came also a multitude out of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them which were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.">Acts 5:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[162] שְׁמוּעָה and שְׁמֻעָה prop. that which heard: hence (1) a message, tidings, whether joyful or sorrowful, especially a message sent from God: hence (2), i.q. instruction, teaching doctrine; (3), rumour.—GESENIUS.—(I.
