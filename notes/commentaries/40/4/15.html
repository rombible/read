We have to recognise the fact that the Evangelist did not study prophecy as we study it. Books were scarce, and the publican of Capernaum, though his occupation implied some clerkly knowledge, probably had few, and heard rather than read the Scriptures which he quotes. What strikes a man who learns in this way is the coincidence of single words and phrases with familiar facts. He speaks not of what has been <span class= "ital">written,</span> but of what has been <span class= "ital">spoken.</span> He is not careful about the context. When St. Matthew looked back on the change that had come over Capernaum in the arrival of the prophet of Nazareth—a change extending to his own life—these words seemed the only adequate description of it. Here was the very scene of which Isaiah had spoken, the old border country of Zebulon and of Naphthali. To him and to others who had been in the darkness of spiritual ignorance, neglected and uncared for, as sheep gone astray in the dark valley of death, there had sprung up a marvellous Light. Unconsciously he adds his testimony to that of St. John, that the presence of Jesus was felt to be that of the “true Light” that “lighteth every man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm" title="That was the true Light, which lights every man that comes into the world.">John 1:9</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:12-17 It is just with God to take the gospel and the means of grace, from those that slight them and thrust them away. Christ will not stay long where he is not welcome. Those who are without Christ, are in the dark. They were sitting in this condition, a contented posture; they chose it rather than light; they were willingly ignorant. When the gospel comes, light comes; when it comes to any place, when it comes to any soul, it makes day there. Light discovers and directs; so does the gospel. The doctrine of repentance is right gospel doctrine. Not only the austere John Baptist, but the gracious Jesus, preached repentance. There is still the same reason to do so. The kingdom of heaven was not reckoned to be fully come, till the pouring out of the Holy Spirit after Christ's ascension.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That it might be fulfilled ... - This place is recorded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1-2</a>.

Upper Galilee was called Galilee of the Gentiles, because it was occupied chiefly by Gentiles. It was in the neighborhood of Tyre, Sidon, etc. The word "Gentiles" includes in the Scriptures all who are not Jews. It means the same as nations, or, as we should say, the pagan nations.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea&#8212;the coast skirting the Sea of Galilee westward&#8212;beyond Jordan&#8212;a phrase commonly meaning eastward of Jordan; but here and in several places it means westward of the Jordan. The word seems to have got the general meaning of "the other side"; the nature of the case determining which side that was.<p>Galilee of the Gentiles&#8212;so called from its position, which made it the frontier between the Holy Land and the external world. While Ephraim and Judah, as Stanley says, were separated from the world by the Jordan valley on one side and the hostile Philistines on another, the northern tribes were in the direct highway of all the invaders from the north, in unbroken communication with the promiscuous races who have always occupied the heights of Lebanon, and in close and peaceful alliance with the most commercial nation of the ancient world, the Phœnicians. Twenty of the cities of Galilee were actually annexed by Solomon to the adjacent kingdom of Tyre, and formed, with their territory, the "boundary" or "offscouring" (Gebul or Cabul) of the two dominions&#8212;at a later time still known by the general name of "the boundaries (coasts or borders) of Tyre and Sidon." In the first great transportation of the Jewish population, Naphtali and Galilee suffered the same fate as the trans-jordanic tribes before Ephraim or Judah had been molested (2Ki 15:29). In the time of the Christian era this original disadvantage of their position was still felt; the speech of the Galileans "bewrayed them" by its uncouth pronunciation (Mt 26:73); and their distance from the seats of government and civilization at Jerusalem and C&aelig;sarea gave them their character for turbulence or independence, according as it was viewed by their friends or their enemies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-16.htm" title="The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up.">Matthew 4:16</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That it might be fulfilled which was spoken,....

No completely corresponding and purely Greek usage is found, as the accusatives of direction, in Bernhardy, p. 144 f., comp. Kühner, II. 1, p. 268 f., do not stand independent of a verb. <span class="greekheb">πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδ</span>. is not, like <span class="greekheb">ὁδὸν θαλ</span>, a determination of the position of <span class="greekheb">γῆ Ζαβ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">γῆ Νεφθ</span>., as these tribes were situated on this side the Jordan, while <span class="greekheb">πέραν</span> (in answer to Bengel, Kuinoel, Linder in the Stud. u. Krit. 1862, p. 553) can never signify on this side (Crome, Beitr. p. 83 ff.); but it designates, after these two lands, a new land as the theatre of the working of Jesus, viz. Peraea (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-25.htm" title="And there followed him great multitudes of people from Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.">Matthew 4:25</a>), whose customary designation was <span class="greekheb">עבר הירדן</span>, <span class="greekheb">πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου</span>—that is, the land east of Jordan. The evangelist includes this land as well as <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶν</span>, because it stands in the prophetic passage along with the others (not with reference to the Peraean ministry of Jesus, de Wette, Bleek, which has no place here), leaving it, besides, to the reader to decide that it was only in <span class="greekheb">γῆ Ζαβουλὼν</span> … <span class="greekheb">θαλάσσης</span> that the specific element of locality which was to be demonstrated from the prophecies was contained. The citation, moreover, which specially sets forth that Jesus; after He had quitted Nazareth, settled at Capernaum, on the borders of Zebulon and Naphtali, in their telic connection with a divine prediction (<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> of the divine determination), shows in this very circumstance the Messianic fulfilment of the historical relation of the prophetic declaration, according to which there was announced to northern Galilee safety and salvation from the oppression of the Assyrians, and consequently theocratical, political salvation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Γαλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐθνῶν</span>] <span class="greekheb">נְּלִיל הַנּוֹיִם</span> (district of the heathen), that is, in keeping with the originally appellative term <span class="greekheb">גליל</span>, which had become a proper name, Upper Galilee, in the neighbourhood of Phoenicia, inhabited by a mixed population of heathens (Strabo, xvi. p. 760) and Jews. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/5-15.htm" title="And said, They of Ptolemais, and of Tyrus, and Sidon, and all Galilee of the Gentiles, are assembled together against us to consume us.">1Ma 5:15</a> : <span class="greekheb">Γαλιλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλοφύλων</span>.

Nephthalim</span>, equivalent to the later Upper and Lower Galilee. <span class="cmt_word">By the way of the sea</span>; <span class="accented">toward the sea</span> (Revised Version); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-18.htm">Jeremiah 2:18</a>; "<span class="accented">i.e.</span> the district on the W. of the Sea of Galilee, as opposed to 'the other side of Jordan,' and 'the circle of the nations,' <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the frontier districts nearest to Phoenicia, including 'the land of Cabul' (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-11.htm">1 Kings 9:11-13</a>), which formed part of the later Upper Galilee. <span class="accented">Via Marls</span>, M. Renan observes, was the name of the high road from Acre to Damascus, as late as the Crusades. 'Way,' however, here means 'region' (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-12.htm">Isaiah 58:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/24-4.htm">Job 24:4</a>)" (Cheyne, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-1.htm">Isaiah 9:1</a>). Yet hardly so; <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, is adverbial, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-48.htm">1 Kings 8:48</a> (equivalent to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-38.htm">2 Chronicles 6:38</a>), and designates the stretching of the districts of Zebulun and Naphtali towards the sea. The sea is the Sea of Galilee. The close union of this clause in the Authorized Version with the following words, "beyond Jordan," misses its true meaning as explanatory of the position of Zebulun and Naphtali, and rather takes it as describing some special locality east of Jordan. <span class="cmt_word">Beyond Jordan</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the eastern side, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-29.htm">2 Kings 15:29</a> as having suffered with Naphtali under the Assyrian invasion; see further ver. 25. Galilee of the Gentiles (<span class="accented">vide supra</span>, "by the way of the sea"). </body></html>
