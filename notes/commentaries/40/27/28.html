St. Mark and St. John call it purple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm" title="And they clothed him with purple, and platted a crown of thorns, and put it about his head,">Mark 15:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-2.htm" title="And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and they put on him a purple robe,">John 19:2</a>); but the “purple “of the ancients was “crimson,” and the same colour might easily be called by either name. It was probably some cast-off cloak of Pilate’s own, or, possibly, that in which Herod had before arrayed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>). Philo records a like mockery as practised upon an idiot at Alexandria, who was there made to represent Herod Agrippa II. (<span class= "ital">in Flacc.</span> p. 980). It was but too common a practice to subject condemned prisoners before execution to this kind of outrage. Here the point of the mockery lay, of course, in the fact that their Victim had been condemned as claiming the title of a King. They had probably seen or heard of the insults of like kind offered by Herod and his soldiers (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-21.htm" title="But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.">Luke 23:21</a>), and now reproduced them with aggravated cruelty.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:26-30 Crucifixion was a death used only among the Romans; it was very terrible and miserable. A cross was laid on the ground, to which the hands and feet were nailed, it was then lifted up and fixed upright, so that the weight of the body hung on the nails, till the sufferer died in agony. Christ thus answered the type of the brazen serpent raised on a pole. Christ underwent all the misery and shame here related, that he might purchase for us everlasting life, and joy, and glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And they stripped him - That is, they either took off all his upper garments or removed all his clothing, probably the former.<p>A scarlet robe - Mark says they clothed him in "purple." The "scarlet" color was obtained from a species of fruit; "purple" from shell-fish.<p>See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-18.htm">Isaiah 1:18</a>. The ancients gave the name "purple" to any color that had a mixture of "red" in it, and consequently these different colors might be sometimes called by the same name. The "robe" used here was the same kind worn by Roman generals and other distinguished officers of the Roman army, and also by the Roman governors. It was made so as to be placed on the shoulders, and was bound around the body so as to leave the right arm at liberty. As we cannot suppose that Pilate would array him in a new and splendid robe, we must suppose that this was one which had been worn and cast off as useless, and was now used to array the Son of God as an object of ridicule and scorn.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 27:27-33.

Of his clothes; at least of his upper garment: for one man to spit upon another, as these soldiers afterwards did on Christ, or to strip him of his garment, according to the Jewish canons, were punishable with a fine of four hundred pence (z), which amounted to twelve pounds and ten shillings of our money; but the soldiers were in no danger of being prosecuted, for stripping Christ. This is one part of the low estate Christ submitted to: his clothes on his back seem to be all he had in this world, and of these he is stripped: <p>and put on him a scarlet robe, or "a red coat", as the Persic version renders it; very likely an old coat of one of their officers. The Evangelists Mark and John say it was "purple", <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/15-17.htm">Mark 15:17</a>, and so the Arabic version renders it here: whether there were two garments put upon him, the one a purple vest, and the other a scarlet robe over it; or whether scarlet was used instead of purple, is not certain; which was a colour wore by kings, and a sign of imperial dignity (a); and therefore put upon Christ by way of mockery, upbraiding him with the character he bore, as king of the Jews. This was an emblem of his being clothed, as it were with our sins, which are as scarlet, and of his bloody sufferings in the human nature. <p>(z) Misn. Bava Kama, c. 8. sect. 6.

(<span class="ital">in Flaccum</span>, 6) a historic parallel, in which the youth of Alexandria treat similarly a half-witted person, Karabas, the real design being to insult Herod Agrippa.

This may have been a worn-out scarf belonging to Pilate; it is different from “the gorgeous robe” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-11.htm" title="And Herod with his men of war set him at nothing, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.">Luke 23:11</a>), which Herod’s soldiers put on Jesus. Scarlet was the proper colour for the military chlamys. (See <span class="ital">Dict. of Ant.</span>) St Mark has the less definite “purple;” St John “a purple robe.” Purple, however, is used by Latin writers to denote any bright colour.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-28.htm" title="And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.">Matthew 27:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Χλαμύδα κοκκίνην</span>, <span class="ital">a crimson robe</span>) They make sport of His kingdom, as the Jews had done of His prophetical dignity; ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-68.htm" title="Saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ, Who is he that smote you?">Matthew 26:68</a>.
