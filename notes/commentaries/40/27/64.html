This was permitted that there might be certain proof of our Lord's resurrection. Pilate told them that they might secure the sepulchre as carefully as they could. They sealed the stone, and set a guard, and were satisfied that all needful care was taken. But to guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples was folly, because needless; while to think to guard it against the power of God, was folly, because fruitless, and to no purpose; yet they thought they dealt wisely. But the Lord took the wise in their own craftiness.

The rulers had no power in themselves to take the measures which they required. Jesus was a state criminal, and they dared not assume the responsibility of guarding his tomb from invasion. <span class="cmt_word">Until the third day.</span> Which was all that was necessary, as Christ had promised to rise on that day - neither before nor after it; and if it passed without the predicted event, he would be proved to be an impostor. <span class="cmt_word">Come by night</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>). This word is absent from the best manuscripts and from the Vulgate. It seems to have been an early interpolation. <span class="cmt_word">And steal him away</span>. A most unlikely hypothesis under the circumstances. The disciples had forsaken Christ while alive, were now hiding in terror, and utterly demoralized and depressed; were they likely to incur further danger for the sake of supporting an assertion, which, unless it proved absolutely true, would only further crush their faith and hope? The rulers seem to have had an uneasy feeling that Jesus might reappear, and they thus prepared themselves to cast discredit upon him, even if, like Lazarus, he rose from the dead. This explanation of the Resurrection has obtained among the Jews from the time of Justin Martyr ('Dial. c. Tryph.,' 17; 108.), and has scarcely yet died out, though in many quarters what is called the "vision<span class="accented">-</span>hypothesis" has taken its place (see on Matthew 28:15, and Edersheim, 2, pp. 626, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">The people</span>. The Pharisees were always disdainful of the vulgar herd. "This people who knoweth not the Law are cursed" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-49.htm">John 7:49</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The last error...the first.</span> "Error" is <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;</span>, as they had called Christ <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (ver. 63), so the word here may be taken actively, as meaning "imposture." The deception arising from his death and supposed resurrection would be of graver consequence than that concerned with his previous life. Morison, considering the word to have its usual meaning of "error," regards it as used by the Pharisees in a political sense, in accordance with the governor's standpoint: "If that deceiver's body should be stolen by his disciples, the fickle people will undoubtedly leap back to their old conclusion, that after all he was what he professed to be. This conclusion would be, as we all know, an 'error;' but yet it would be most thin, ions to the interests of Caesar. There would be more political disaffection than ever." It is more simple to say that the first error, the acceptance of Christ's Messianic claims, was not of such decided and far-reaching consequence as would be the belief in his resurrection. They do not, indeed, see all that such belief involves; but they understood enough to know that it would give supernatural importance to all the words and acts of his life. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Error (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;)<p>Not, as many render, deceit or imposture, referring to &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; above; but the error on the people's part. The last error, namely, the false impression that he has risen from the dead, will be worse than the first error - the impression made by his impostures that he was the Messiah. </body></html>
