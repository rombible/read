The former gives the better meaning. The “watch,” or “guard,” was a body of Roman soldiers (St. Matthew uses the Latin term <span class= "ital">custodia</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> who could not be set to such a task without Pilate’s permission. If the priests had had such a “guard” at their disposal before, there would have been no need for them to apply to Pilate.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:62-66 On the Jewish sabbath, the chief priests and Pharisees, when they should have been at their devotions, were dealing with Pilate about securing the sepulchre. This was permitted that there might be certain proof of our Lord's resurrection. Pilate told them that they might secure the sepulchre as carefully as they could. They sealed the stone, and set a guard, and were satisfied that all needful care was taken. But to guard the sepulchre against the poor weak disciples was folly, because needless; while to think to guard it against the power of God, was folly, because fruitless, and to no purpose; yet they thought they dealt wisely. But the Lord took the wise in their own craftiness. Thus shall all the rage and the plans of Christ's enemies be made to promote his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye have a watch - The Jews had a guard of Roman soldiers, who kept watch in the tower of Antonia, on the northwest of the temple. Pilate either referred to these, or to the "watch" that attended the crucifixion - the whole "band" that had been appointed for that. As the torments of crucifixion sometimes lasted many days, the band had been probably granted to them during that time, and they were therefore still at the direction of the chief priests. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/27.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>65.

The sealing was effected by stretching a cord across the stone at the mouth of the sepulchre, and then fastening it to the rock at either end by means of sealing-clay (Paulsen, <span class="ital">Regier. d. Morgenl.</span> p. 298; Harmar, <span class="ital">Bcobacht</span>. II. p. 467); or if the stone at the door happened to be fastened with a cross-beam, this latter was sealed to the rock (Strauss, <span class="ital">Sinai und Golgatha</span>, p. 205).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As it is certain that Jesus cannot have predicted His resurrection in any explicit or intelligible manner even to His own disciples; as, moreover, it is impossible to suppose that the women who visited the grave on the resurrection morning could have contemplated embalming the body, or would have concerned themselves merely about how the stone was to be rolled away, if they had been aware that a watch had been set, and that the grave had been sealed; and finally, as the supposition that Pilate complied with the request for a guard, or at all events, that the members of the Sanhedrim so little understood their own interest as both to leave the body of Jesus in the hands of His followers instead of taking possession of it themselves, and to bribe the soldiers to give false testimony instead of duly calling them to account, as they might have done, for their culpable neglect, is in the highest degree improbable, just as much so as the idea that the procurator would be likely to take no notice of a dereliction of duty on the part of his own soldiers, who, by maintaining the truth of a very stupid fabrication, would only be proclaiming how much they themselves were to blame in the matter: it follows that the story about the watching of the grave—a story which is further disproved by the fact that nowhere in the discussions belonging to the apostolic age do we find any reference <span class="ital">confirmatory</span> or <span class="ital">otherwise</span> to the alleged stealing of the body—<span class="ital">must be referred to the category of unhistorical legend</span>. And a clue to the <span class="ital">origin</span> of this legend is furnished by the evangelist himself in mentioning the rumour about the stealing of the body,—a rumour emanating to all appearance from a Jewish source, and circulated with the hostile intention of disproving the resurrection of Jesus (Paulus, <span class="ital">exeg. Handb</span>. III. p. 837 ff.; Strauss, II. p. 562 ff.; Schleiermacher, <span class="ital">L. J</span>. p. 458 ff.; Weisse, Ewald, Hase, Bleek, Keim, Scholten, Hilgenfeld). The arguments advanced by Hug in the <span class="ital">Freyburg. Zeitschr</span>. 1831, 3, p. 184 ff.; 5, p. 80 ff.; Kuinoel, Hofmann, Krabbe, Ebrard, Lange, Riggenbach, Steinmeyer, against the supposition of a legend, resolve themselves into arbitrary assumptions and foreign importations which simply leave the matter as historically incomprehensible as ever. The same thing may be said with regard to the emendation which Olshausen takes the liberty of introducing, according to which it is made to appear that the Sanhedrim did not act in their corporate capacity, but that the affair was managed simply on the authority of Caiaphas alone. Still the unhistorical character of the story by no means justifies the assumption of an interpolation (in opposition to Stroth in Eichhorn’s <span class="ital">Repert</span>. IX. p. 141),—an interpolation, too, that would have had to be introduced into three different passages (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-62.htm" title="Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,">Matthew 27:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-66.htm" title="So they went, and made the sepulcher sure, sealing the stone, and setting a watch.">Matthew 27:66</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-4.htm" title="And for fear of him the keepers did shake, and became as dead men.">Matthew 28:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-11.htm" title="Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done.">Matthew 28:11</a> ff.); yet one can understand how this apocryphal story should have most readily engrafted itself specially and <span class="ital">exclusively</span> upon the Gospel of Matthew, a Gospel originating in Judaeo-Christian circles, and having, by this time, the more developed form in which it has come down to us. For a further amplification of the legend, see <span class="ital">Ev. Nicod</span>. 14.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/27.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-65.htm" title="Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as you can.">Matthew 27:65</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔχετε</span>: probably imperative, not indicative = have your watch, the ready assent of a man who thinks there is not likely to be much need for it, but has no objections to gratify their wish in a small matter. So most recent interpreters—Meyer, Weiss, Holtz., Weizsäcker, Morison, Spk., <span class="ital">Com.</span>, Alford. The Vulgate takes it as indicative = <span class="ital">habetis</span>, which Schanz follows. This rendering implies that Pilate wished them to be content with what they had already, either their own temple watch or soldiers already put at their disposal. Carr (Camb. N.

It seems quite clear from ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-14.htm" title="And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.">Matthew 28:14</a> that the guard was of Roman soldiers.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/27.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-65.htm" title="Pilate said to them, You have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as you can.">Matthew 27:65</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔχετε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">ye have</span>, etc.) Pilate gives the guards quickly: and yet, as it were with indignation (cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/28-11.htm" title="Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things that were done....">Matthew 28:11-12</a>), dismisses the calumniators quickly also.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 65.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ye have a watch</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="accented">take a guard</span>).
