Inasmuch as he did not use his power to quit the body, as soon as it was fastened to the cross, leaving only an insensible corpse to the cruelty of his murderers: but continued his abode in it, with a steady resolution, as long as it was proper.

Never were there three such hours since the day God created man upon the earth, never such a dark and awful scene; it was the turning point of that great affair, man's redemption and salvation. Jesus uttered a complaint from Ps 22:1. Hereby he teaches of what use the word of God is to direct us in prayer, and recommends the use of Scripture expressions in prayer. The believer may have tasted some drops of bitterness, but he can only form a very feeble idea of the greatness of Christ's sufferings. Yet, hence he learns something of the Saviour's love to sinners; hence he gets deeper conviction of the vileness and evil of sin, and of what he owes to Christ, who delivers him from the wrath to come. His enemies wickedly ridiculed his complaint. Many of the reproaches cast upon the word of God and the people of God, arise, as here, from gross mistakes. Christ, just before he expired, spake in his full strength, to show that his life was not forced from him, but was freely delivered into his Father's hands. He had strength to bid defiance to the powers of death: and to show that by the eternal Spirit he offered himself, being the Priest as well as the Sacrifice, he cried with a loud voice. Then he yielded up the ghost. The Son of God upon the cross, did die by the violence of the pain he was put to. His soul was separated from his body, and so his body was left really and truly dead. It was certain that Christ did die, for it was needful that he should die. He had undertaken to make himself an offering for sin, and he did it when he willingly gave up his life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cried again with a loud voice - He cried, "It is finished," <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-30.htm">John 19:30</a>. It was in the height of his agony, probably attended with deep groaning, and uttered amid sorrows which were never else experienced in our world. It finished the work of atonement, made the way of salvation possible, rolled away the curse from guilty people, and opened the kingdom of heaven to all true believers.<p>Yielded up the ghost - This, though a literal translation, is unhappy.

The different ways the Jews and the Romans had of counting hours, make us to be at a loss sometimes as to circumstances of time to reconcile some scriptures. But as to the present difficulty, it is said that the Jews, as they divided the night into four watches, so they also divided the day into four parts, each part having its denomination from the succeeding part, by which name all the intermediate time was called. Thus when the third hour (which with us is nine of the clock) was past, they called all the sixth hour till past twelve. Thus Pilate condemned Christ in the beginning of the sixth hour, and the darkness began at the end of it, that is, after twelve, for dividing the day into quadrants, the hours had their denomination from them. John also saith no more than <span class="ital">about</span> <span class="ital">the sixth hour, </span> which is true if it were some small time after. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">There was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour.</span> That this darkness was caused by the eclipse of the sun at that time of the day is plain enough, but that this was no eclipse in the ordinary course of nature is evident; for; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Whereas all eclipses use to be in the time of the new moon, this was when the moon was at the full, the fifteenth day of the month Nisan. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. This eclipse was not seen in one part or in another, but over all the earth that was under the same hemisphere. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. No eclipse in a natural course can last three hours. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So that plainly this was a miraculous eclipse, not caused by the interposition of the moon, (as other eclipses), but by the mighty and extraordinary power of God, which made a heathen philosopher at a great distance cry out, Either the Divine Being now suffereth, or sympathizes with one that suffereth: he is said to have seen this eclipse in Egypt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And about the ninth hour</span> (that is, about three of the clock, as we reckon the hours) <span class="ital">Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, </span> <span class="ital">Eli, Eli, </span> or <span class="ital">Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?</span> The words are Hebrew, though Mark reports them according to the Syriac corruption of the dialect. They are David’s words, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-1.htm" title="My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? why are you so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?">Psalm 22:1</a></span>. David was a type of Christ. He that was the Son of David useth David’s words, possibly spoken by David in the person of Christ. God’s forsaking any person or place, must be understood with reference not to his essential presence, for so he filleth all places, and is present with all persons; but with reference to the manifestations of his providence for our good: thus when God withholds his good providence to us, either with respect to our outward or inward man, he is said to forsake us. A total forsaking either of our bodies, or of our souls, is not consistent with the being of our outward man, or the spiritual being or life of our inward man. All forsakings therefore in this life are gradual and partial. The forsaking which Christ therefore here complains of, was not the total withdrawing of Divine favour and assistance from him; that was impossible, and incompetent with the first words testifying his relation to God, and assistance in him; but it must be understood with respect to God’s consolatory manifestations, and that is testified by his other words, related by Luke, <span class="ital">Father, </span> <span class="ital">into thy hands I commend my spirit.</span> Which words having said, he <span class="ital">gave up the ghost, </span> say Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John addeth, that he <span class="ital">bowed his head, and gave up the ghost:</span> words added, to confirm what he elsewhere said, that he laid down his life, none took it from him. His crying twice at this instant with a loud voice, argued his spirits not so spent, but he might have lived a few minutes longer, but he freely laid down his life. The people saying, <span class="ital">He calleth</span> <span class="ital">for Elias, </span> when he said <span class="ital">Eli, Eli, </span> spake them to be Jews, who to this day dream of an Elias to come and <span class="ital">restore all things.</span> That they no better distinguished between Eli and Elias, must be attributed either to the corruption of their dialect, he saying <span class="ital">Eloi, Eloi, </span> (according to the Syriac corruption of the term), or their too great distance from him. Their mocking him upon it was but consonant to their former behaviour toward him, while he was upon the cross. Their giving him the spunge with vinegar and hyssop we before gave an account of. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Jesus, when he had cried again,....

It was not taken from him, he laid down his life of himself, as the Lord of it, and gave himself freely to be an offering and sacrifice in the room of his people; which is a proof of his great love, and amazing grace unto them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{13}</span> Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.</span><p>(13) Christ, after he had overcome other enemies, at length provokes and attacks death itself.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/27.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-50.htm" title="Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, yielded up the ghost.">Matthew 27:50</a> <span class="greekheb">Πάλιν</span>] refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-46.htm" title="And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?">Matthew 27:46</a>. <span class="ital">What</span> did Jesus cry in this instance?

The theory of a <span class="ital">merely apparent death</span> (Bahrdt, Venturini Paulus) is so decidedly at variance with the predictions of Jesus Himself regarding His end, as well as with the whole testimony of the Gospel, is so utterly destructive of the fundamental idea of the resurrection, undermines so completely the whole groundwork of the redemption brought about by Christ, is so inconsistent with the accumulated testimony of centuries as furnished by the very existence of the church itself, which is based upon the facts of the death and the resurrection of Jesus, and requires such a remarkable series of other theories and assumptions of an extraordinary and supernatural character in order to explain duly authenticated facts regarding Christ’s appearance and actings after His resurrection,—that, with friends and foes alike testifying to the actual death of Jesus, we are bound at once to dismiss it as an utterly abortive attempt to get rid of the physiological mystery (but see on Luke, Remarks after <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-51.htm" title="And shall cut him asunder, and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.">Matthew 24:51</a>) of the resurrection. It is true that though those modern critics (Strauss, Weisse, Ewald, Schweizer, Schenkel, Volkmar, Scholten, Keim) who deny the literal resurrection of Christ’s body, and who suggest various ways of accounting for His alleged reappearing again on several occasions, do not dispute the reality of His death, their view is nevertheless as much at variance with the whole of the New Testament evidence in favour of the resurrection as is the one just adverted to.

Probably the cry here resolved itself into the words recorded by St. Luke, "Father, into  thy hands I commend my spirit." <span class="cmt_word">With a loud voice.</span> This loud cry at the moment of death proved that he laid down his life voluntarily; no man could take it from him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-17.htm">John 10:17, 18</a>); he himself willed to die; and this preternatural voice proceeded from one who died not altogether from physical exhaustion, but from determined purpose. <span class="cmt_word">Yielded up the ghost</span> (<span class="greek_word">a)fh  =  ke to\ pneu  =  ma</span>); literally, <span class="accented">dismissed his spirit</span>; <span class="accented">emisit spiritum</span>). The phrase has been interpreted to signify that Christ exerted his power to anticipate the actual moment of dissolution; but there is no necessity of importing this idea into the expression. It is used ordinarily to denote the act of dying, as we say, "He expired." Perhaps the exertion of uttering this great cry ruptured some organ of the body. We know from the effect of the piercing of his side that his sacred heart was previously broken; and thus he verily and really died upon the cross. He, being in the form of God, and equal with God, became obedient unto death, even the death of the cross, suffered death forevery man. It is to be noted that the death of Christ occurred at 3 p.m., the very time when the Paschal lambs began to be slain in the temple courts. Thus the long prepared type was at last fulfilled, when "Christ our Passover was sacrificed for us." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/27.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Yielded up the ghost (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b5; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;)<p>Lit., dismissed his spirit.
