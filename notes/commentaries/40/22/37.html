It is significant (1) that the answer comes from the same chapter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/6-4.htm" title="Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:">Deuteronomy 6:4-5</a>) which supplied our Lord with two out of His three answers to the Tempter (see Notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-4.htm" title="But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.">Matthew 4:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-7.htm" title="Jesus said to him, It is written again, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.">Matthew 4:7</a>); and (2) that He does but repeat the answer that had been given before by the “certain lawyer” who stood up tempting Him, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-25.htm" title="And, behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tempted him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?">Luke 10:25</a>. In their ethical teaching the Pharisees had grasped the truth intellectually, though they did not realise it in their lives, and our Lord did not shrink, therefore, so far, from identifying His teaching with theirs. Truth was truth, even though it was held by the Pharisees and coupled with hypocrisy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/22.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-37.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind....">Matthew 22:37-40</a></span>. <span class="ital">Jesus said, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart </span>— Concerning this first and great commandment, and the words wherewith Moses prefaced it, see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; and for the elucidation of this whole paragraph, see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/12-28.htm" title="And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of all?...">Mark 12:28-34</a>, where the conversation which our Lord had with this scribe is related more at large. <span class="ital">On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets </span>— That is, they contain the substance or abridgment of all the religious and moral duties contained in the law and the prophets, which therefore may be all said to hang or depend on them. The expression, says Dr. Whitby, is a metaphor taken from a custom mentioned by Tertullian of hanging up their laws in a public place to be seen of all men; and it imports that in these precepts is compendiously contained all that the law and prophets require, in reference to our duty to God and man; for though there be some precepts of temperance which we owe to ourselves, yet are they such as we may be moved to perform from the true love of God and of our neighbour; whom if we truly love we cannot be wanting in them. For the love of God will make us humble and contented with our lot; it will preserve us from all intemperance, impatience, and unholy desires; it will make us watchful over ourselves, that we may keep a good conscience, and solicitous for our eternal welfare. And the love of our neighbour will free us from all angry passions, envy, malice, revenge, and other unkind tempers: so that both taken together will introduce into us the whole mind that was in Christ, and cause us <span class="ital">to walk as he walked.</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:34-40 An interpreter of the law asked our Lord a question, to try, not so much his knowledge, as his judgment. The love of God is the first and great commandment, and the sum of all the commands of the first table. Our love of God must be sincere, not in word and tongue only. All our love is too little to bestow upon him, therefore all the powers of the soul must be engaged for him, and carried out toward him. To love our neighbour as ourselves, is the second great commandment. There is a self-love which is corrupt, and the root of the greatest sins, and it must be put off and mortified; but there is a self-love which is the rule of the greatest duty: we must have a due concern for the welfare of our own souls and bodies. And we must love our neighbour as truly and sincerely as we love ourselves; in many cases we must deny ourselves for the good of others. By these two commandments let our hearts be formed as by a mould.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus said unto him ... - Mark says that he introduced this by referring to the doctrine of the unity of God "Hear, O Israel! the Lord thy God is one Lord" - taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-4.htm">Deuteronomy 6:4</a>. This was said, probably, because all true obedience depends on the correct knowledge of God. None can keep his commandments who are not acquainted with his nature, his perfections, and his right to command,<p>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart - The meaning of this is, thou shalt love him with all thy faculties or powers. Thou shalt love him supremely, more than all other beings and things, and with all the ardor possible. To love him with all the heart is to fix the affections supremely on him, more strongly than on anything else, and to be willing to give up all that we hold dear at his command,<p>With all thy soul - Or, with all thy "life." This means, to be willing to give up the life to him, and to devote it all to his service; to live to him, and to be willing to die at his command,<p>With all thy mind - To submit the "intellect" to his will. To love his law and gospel more than we do the decisions of our own minds. To be willing to submit all our faculties to his teaching and guidance, and to devote to him all our intellectual attainments and all the results of our intellectual efforts.<p>"With all thy strength" (Mark).

Directly, without taking time to think of it; and though he knew with what design it was put to him, yet, as an answer to it might be useful and instructive to the people, as well as silence and confound his adversaries, he thought fit to give one; and is as follows, being what is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>. <p>thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind; that is, with all the powers and faculties of the soul, the will, the understanding, and the affections; in the most sincere, upright, and perfect manner, without any dissimulation and hypocrisy, and above all objects whatever, for this the law requires; and which man, in his state of innocence, was capable of, though now fallen, he is utterly unable to perform; so far from it, that without the grace of God, he has no true love at all to God, in his heart, soul and mind, but all the reverse; his carnal mind is enmity against God, and everything that is divine and good, or that belongs unto him: and though this is now the case of man, yet his obligation to love the Lord in this manner is still the same; and when the Spirit of God does produce the grace and fruit of love in his soul, he does love the Lord sincerely; because of the perfections of his nature, and the works of his hands, and because of the blessings of grace bestowed, and especially for Christ, the unspeakable gift of his love; and most affectionately does he love him, when he is most sensible of his everlasting and unchangeable love to him, and when that is shed abroad by the Spirit; "for we love him, because he first loved us", <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-19.htm">1 John 4:19</a> instead of, "with all thy mind", as here, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm">Deuteronomy 6:5</a> it is read, "with all thy might"; and which clause is here added by the Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions, as it is in <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-30.htm">Mark 12:30</a>. The Hebrew phrase seems to denote the vehemency of affections, with which God is to be beloved. Though the Jewish writers (s) paraphrase and interpret it, "with all thy substance", or "money"; and in the Misna (t), the following interpretation is given of the whole, <p>""with all thy heart", with thy imaginations, with the good imagination, and with the evil imagination; and "with all thy soul", even if he should take away thy soul; and "with all thy strength", with all thy "mammon", or riches; or otherwise, "with all thy might", with every measure he measures unto thee, do thou measure unto him; <p>that is, as one of the commentators says (u), whether it be good or evil; or, as another (w), in every case that happens give thanks to God, and praise him. And certain it is, that as God is to be loved in the strongest manner we are capable of, and with all we have, and are; so always, at all times, under all dispensations of his providence, and upon all accounts, and for all he does towards, in, upon, and for us, <p>(s) Targum Onk. &amp; Jarchi in Deut. vi. 5.

Those who have copied or collated MSS., have for the most part treated the article with indifference; but as far as can be gathered from MSS. lately collated, St Matthew introduced the article only in the last clause. In the Hebrew it is <span class="greekheb">ובכל מאדך</span>, <span class="ital">q.d., and with all thy strength</span> (<span class="ital">et in omni validitate tuâ</span>).

They all form an <span class="ital">epitasis</span>,[975] with which St Matthew’s introduction of the article only in the third clause agrees.
