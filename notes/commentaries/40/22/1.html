And as our Lord had in that foretold the approaching ruin of the Jewish place and nation, he goes on in this to vindicate God’s mercy and justice in the rejection of that people and the calling of the Gentiles; admonishing the latter, at the same time, of the necessity of holiness, and showing that if they remained destitute of it, they would meet with the same severity of judgment which had befallen the disobedient Jews.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:1-14 The provision made for perishing souls in the gospel, is represented by a royal feast made by a king, with eastern liberality, on the marriage of his son. Our merciful God has not only provided food, but a royal feast, for the perishing souls of his rebellious creatures. There is enough and to spare, of every thing that can add to our present comfort and everlasting happiness, in the salvation of his Son Jesus Christ. The guests first invited were the Jews. When the prophets of the Old Testament prevailed not, nor John the Baptist, nor Christ himself, who told them the kingdom of God was at hand, the apostles and ministers of the gospel were sent, after Christ's resurrection, to tell them it was come, and to persuade them to accept the offer. The reason why sinners come not to Christ and salvation by him, is, not because they cannot, but because they will not. Making light of Christ, and of the great salvation wrought out by him, is the damning sin of the world. They were careless. Multitudes perish for ever through mere carelessness, who show no direct aversion, but are careless as to their souls. Also the business and profit of worldly employments hinder many in closing with the Saviour. Both farmers and merchants must be diligent; but whatever we have of the world in our hands, our care must be to keep it out of our hearts, lest it come between us and Christ. The utter ruin coming upon the Jewish church and nation, is here represented. Persecution of Christ's faithful ministers fills up the measure of guilt of any people. The offer of Christ and salvation to the Gentiles was not expected; it was such a surprise as it would be to wayfaring men, to be invited to a royal wedding-feast. The design of the gospel is to gather souls to Christ; all the children of God scattered abroad, Joh 10:16; 11:52. The case of hypocrites is represented by the guest that had not on a wedding-garment. It concerns all to prepare for the scrutiny; and those, and those only, who put on the Lord Jesus, who have a Christian temper of mind, who live by faith in Christ, and to whom he is all in all, have the wedding-garment. The imputed righteousness of Christ, and the sanctification of the Spirit, are both alike necessary. No man has the wedding-garment by nature, or can form it for himself. The day is coming, when hypocrites will be called to account for all their presumptuous intruding into gospel ordinances, and usurpation of gospel privileges. Take him away. Those that walk unworthy of Christianity, forfeit all the happiness they presumptuously claimed. Our Saviour here passes out of the parable into that which it teaches. Hypocrites go by the light of the gospel itself down to utter darkness. Many are called to the wedding-feast, that is, to salvation, but few have the wedding-garment, the righteousness of Christ, the sanctification of the Spirit. Then let us examine ourselves whether we are in the faith, and seek to be approved by the King.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Jesus answered and spake unto them again in parables - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-3.htm">Matthew 13:3</a>.

Olshausen and Keim are not justified in doubting this connection on the ground that <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-45.htm" title="And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.">Matthew 21:45</a> f. is, as they suppose, the formal <span class="ital">conclusion</span>. The parable as given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm" title="Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:">Luke 14:16</a> ff. is not a Pauline modification of the one before us (Baur, Hilgenfeld), but is rather to be regarded as representing an imperfect version of it which had found its way into the document consulted by Luke. <span class="ital">Others</span> are of opinion that the parable in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14-16.htm" title="Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:">Luke 14:16</a> ff. is the more original of the two, and that here it is interwoven with another (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-8.htm" title="Then said he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.">Matthew 22:8</a> ff.), the introduction to which, however, has disappeared, and that, in the process, still a third feature (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-6.htm" title="And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them spitefully, and slew them....">Matthew 22:6-7</a>) has been added from the parable which precedes (Ewald, Schneckenburger, de Wette, Strauss, Weizsäcker, Keim, Scholten). But coming as it does after the remark of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-45.htm" title="And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.">Matthew 21:45</a> f., a <span class="ital">somewhat copious</span> parable such as that before us, so far from being a mere heaping of passage upon passage, is intended to serve as a <span class="ital">forcible concluding address</span> directed against His obdurate enemies,—an address, too, which does not interrupt the connection, since it was delivered before those for whom it was intended had had time to withdraw (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-15.htm" title="Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him in his talk.">Matthew 22:15</a>). As, in presence of such obduracy, <span class="ital">thoughts</span> of the divine love and of the divine wrath could not but crowd into the mind of Jesus; so, on the other hand, there could not fail to be something corresponding to this in their parabolic <span class="ital">utterance</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,...">Matthew 22:1-14</a>. <span class="ital">The royal wedding</span>.—This parable is peculiar to Mt., and while in some respects very suitable to the situation, may not unreasonably be suspected to owe its place here to the evangelist’s habit of grouping kindred matter. The second part of the parable referring to the man without a wedding robe has no connection with the present situation, or with the Pharisees who are supposed to be addressed. Another question has been much discussed, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, whether this parable was spoken by Jesus at all on any occasion, the idea of many critics being that it is a parable of Christ’s reconstructed by the evangelist or some other person, so as to make it cover the sin and fate of the Jews, the calling of the Gentiles, and the Divine demand tor righteousness in all recipients of His grace. The resemblance between this parable and that of the <span class="ital">Supper</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/14-16.htm" title="Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:...">Luke 14:16-24</a>, is obvious. Assuming that Jesus uttered a parable of this type, the question arises: which of the two forms given by Mt. and Lk. comes nearer to the original? The general verdict is in favour of Luke’s. As to the question of the authenticity of Mt.’s parable, the mere fact that the two parables have a common theme and many features similar is no proof that both could not proceed from Jesus. Why should not the later parable be the same theme handled by the same Artist with variations so as to make it serve a different while connected purpose, the earlier being a parable of <span class="ital">Grace</span>, the later a parable of <span class="ital">Judgment</span> upon grace despised or abused? If the didactic aim of the two parables was as just indicated, the method of variation was preferable to the use of two parables totally unconnected. “What is common gives emphasis to what is peculiar, and bids us mark what it is that is judged” (<span class="ital">The Parabolic Teaching of Christ</span>, p. 463). The main objections to the authenticity of the parable are its allegorical character, and its too distinct anticipation of history. The former objection rests on the assumption that Jesus uttered no parables of the allegorical type. On this, <span class="ital">vide</span> remarks on the parable of the <span class="ital">Sower</span>, chap. 13.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/22.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,...">Matthew 22:1-14</a>.

Peculiar to St Matthew<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The parable recorded by St Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/14-16.htm" title="Then said he to him, A certain man made a great supper, and bade many:...">Luke 14:16-24</a>), though similar to this in some respects, differs in its context and special teaching and in many details.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As of the other parables of the Passion, the primary intention of this regards the present and the immediate future.

In the first (1) the servants are John Baptist and the first disciples of Christ; the feast is the Kingdom of God, or the Christian Church; the invited guests, who refuse to come, are the Jews; the vengeance taken was literally fulfilled at the siege of Jerusalem, a. d. 70. (2) This division relates to the preaching of the Gospel to the Gentiles. As in the Net (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-47.htm" title="Again, the kingdom of heaven is like to a net, that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind:">Matthew 13:47</a>) or in the Corn-field (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-24.htm" title="Another parable put he forth to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which sowed good seed in his field:">Matthew 13:24</a>), worthy and unworthy are mingled until the King separates.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/22.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-1.htm" title="And Jesus answered and spoke to them again by parables, and said,">Matthew 22:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀποκριθεὶς</span>, <span class="ital">answering</span>) Not only he who has been questioned, but he also to whom a reason for speaking has been given, may rightly be said to answer.—<span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>, <span class="ital">again</span>) construe this word with <span class="greekheb">ἐν παραβολαῖς</span>, <span class="ital">in parables, i.e.</span> with the design of putting forth more.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 1-14.</span> - <span class="accented">Parable of the marriage of the king's son.</span> (Peculiar to St. Matthew.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus</span> <span class="cmt_word">answered and spake unto them.</span> After they had heard our Lord's words at the end of the last chapter, the Pharisees, according to St. Mark, "left him, and went their way," so that this parable was spoken in the audience of the disciples and the attendant multitude alone, without the former disturbing element. This fact may account for its exhibiting certain merciful and gracious features, setting forth the privilege rather than the duty of obeying the gospel call. The term "answered" often does not signify a reply given to some distinct question, but is equivalent to "took occasion to observe" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, etc.).

This bears great resemblance to the parable of the great supper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/14.htm">Luke 14</a>.), which, however, was spoken at an earlier period, in another locality, and with a different object, and disagrees in many details, especially in the absence of the wedding garment. Christ, doubtless, often repeated his parables with variations in particulars to suit time, audiences, and circumstances. </body></html>
