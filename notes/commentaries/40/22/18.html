Though opposed to each other, they joined against Christ. What they said of Christ was right; whether they knew it or not, blessed be God we know it. Jesus Christ was a faithful Teacher, and a bold reprover. Christ saw their wickedness. Whatever mask the hypocrite puts on, our Lord Jesus sees through it. Christ did not interpose as a judge in matters of this nature, for his kingdom is not of this world, but he enjoins peaceable subjection to the powers that be. His adversaries were reproved, and his disciples were taught that the Christian religion is no enemy to civil government. Christ is, and will be, the wonder, not only of his friends, but of his enemies. They admire his wisdom, but will not be guided by it; his power, but will not submit to it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus perceived their wickedness - This must have been done by his power of searching the heart, and proves that he was omniscient.<p>No more man has the power of discerning the motives of others.<p>Tempt ye me - Try me, or endeavor to lead me into difficulty by an insidious question.<p>Hypocrites - Dissemblers.

Luke says, "their craftiness"; and Mark says, "knowing their hypocrisy"; for there was, a mixture of malice, hypocrisy, and artfulness, in the scheme they had formed; but Christ being the omniscient God, saw the wickedness of their hearts, knew their hypocritical designs, and was well acquainted with all their artifice: he judged not according to the outward appearance of their affection for him, and opinion of him, of religion, righteousness, and holiness in themselves, and of a sincere desire to have their conscience satisfied about this matter; the snare they laid was visible to him, the mask they put on could not screen them from him, nor impose upon him: <p>and said, why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites? as he might well call them, who feigned themselves just persons, pretended a great deal of respect for him, call him master, compliment him with the characters of a faithful, sincere, and disinterested preacher; yet by putting the above question, designed no other than to ensnare him, and bring him into disgrace or trouble. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/22.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-18.htm" title="But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt you me, you hypocrites?">Matthew 22:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὴν πονηρίαν</span>] for they concealed <span class="ital">malicious designs</span> (the reverse of <span class="greekheb">ἁπλότης</span>) behind their seemingly candid, nay, flatteringly put question, in which their object was to try (<span class="greekheb">πειράζετε</span>) whether He might not be betrayed into returning such an answer as might be used in further proceedings against Him.
