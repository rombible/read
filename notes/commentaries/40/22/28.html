He carried the great truths of the resurrection and a future state, further than they had yet been reveled. There is no arguing from the state of things in this world, as to what will take place hereafter. Let truth be set in a clear light, and it appears in full strength. Having thus silenced them, our Lord proceeded to show the truth of the doctrine of the resurrection from the books of Moses. God declared to Moses that he was the God of the patriarchs, who had died long before; this shows that they were then in a state of being, capable of enjoying his favour, and proves that the doctrine of the resurrection is clearly taught in the Old Testament as well as in the New. But this doctrine was kept for a more full revelation, after the resurrection of Christ, who was the first-fruits of them that slept. All errors arise from not knowing the Scriptures and the power of God. In this world death takes away one after another, and so ends all earthly hopes, joys, sorrows, and connexions.

Amongst other erroneous tenets, they denied the resurrection, as may be seen in that text, as well as this; and (which indeed was their fundamental error) they denied spirits, and consequently the immortality of the soul in its separate estate. Their design seemeth not so much to have been to have drawn out a discourse from our Saviour which might have touched his life, (which was the Pharisees’ design), as to have exposed him, by bringing him to an absurdity. To this purpose they put a case to our Saviour upon the law, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-5.htm" title="If brothers dwell together, and one of them die, and have no child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without to a stranger: her husband's brother shall go in to her, and take her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's brother to her.">Deu 25:5</a></span>, where God had ordained, for the preservation of the inheritances of the several tribes and families distinct, That if brethren dwelt together, and one of them died leaving no issue; the wife of the dead should not marry unto a stranger; her husband’s brother should go in unto her, and take her to him to wife, &c. Now they either knew of, or else supposed, a ease of seven brethren, successively marrying the same woman; they desire to know whose wife of the seven this woman should be in the resurrection. Instead of discovering their acuteness, and putting our Saviour upon a difficulty, they did but betray their own ignorance as to the state of the resurrection. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore in the resurrection,.... As asserted by the Pharisees and by Christ, supposing that there will be such a thing, though not granting it; for these men denied it, wherefore the Ethiopic version reads it hypothetically, "if therefore the dead will be raised"; upon such a supposition, <p>whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her, or were married to her. By putting this question, they thought to have got some advantage against Christ, and in favour of their notion; they hoped, either that he would give into their way of thinking, and relinquish the doctrine of the resurrection upon this, and join with them against the Pharisees, and so there would be no need of an answer to the question; or they judged, that if he returned an answer, it would be either that he did not know whose wife she should be, and then they would traduce him among the common people, as weak and ignorant; or should he say, that she would be the wife of one of them only, naming which of them, or of them all, or of none of them, they fancied that such absurd consequences would follow on each of these, as would expose the doctrine of the resurrection to ridicule and contempt; but they missed their aim, and were sadly disappointed by Christ's answer and reasonings which follow. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/22.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/22.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm" title="Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.">Matthew 22:28</a>. Founding upon this alleged incident (which was undoubtedly a silly invention got up for the occasion, Chrysostom), as being one strictly in accordance with the law, the Sadducees now endeavour to make it appear that the doctrine of the resurrection—a doctrine which, for the purpose of being able to deny it, they choose to apprehend in a gross material sense—is <span class="ital">irreconcilable with the law</span>; while, by their fancied acuteness, they try to involve Jesus Himself in the dilemma of having to give an answer either disadvantageous to the law or favourable to their doctrine.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γυνή</span>] Predicate.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-28.htm" title="Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven? for they all had her.">Matthew 22:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, introducing the puzzling question based on the case stated.—<span class="greekheb">γυνή</span> either subject = whose will the <span class="ital">woman</span> be? or better, the article being wanting, predicate = whose <span class="ital">wife</span> will she be? <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Luke, where <span class="greekheb">γυνή</span> is used twice.—<span class="greekheb">πάντες γὰρ ἐ</span>. <span class="greekheb">α</span>., all had her, and therefore (such is the implied thought) all had equal rights.

The Pharisees also had divided and opposed those things which are Cæsar’s, and those which are God’s: He who is the Truth, affirms both in His reply to them: to the Sadducees He denies both. Earthly wisdom frequently precipitates itself into absurdity from an imperfect enumeration, even in an easy matter, of parts, not one of which escapes heavenly wisdom.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ εἰδότες</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">not knowing</span>, etc.) This twofold ignorance is the mother of almost all errors. The resurrection of the dead rests on the power of God: and the belief in the resurrection rests on the Scriptures. Jesus refutes their <span class="ital">first</span> and fundamental error (<span class="greekheb">πρῶτον ψεῦδος</span>): which they did not suppose themselves to labour under at all. He first answers the argument by which they opposed the truth: then He proves the truth itself.—<span class="greekheb">τὰς γραφὰς</span>, <span class="ital">the Scriptures</span>) which clearly look to a future life; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-31.htm" title="But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,...">Matthew 22:31-32</a>.
