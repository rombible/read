For this purpose he publicly asked their opinion of a difficulty concerning the Messiah’s pedigree, arising from Psalms 110 : <span class="ital">What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? — </span>Whose son do you expect the Messiah to be, who was promised to the fathers? <span class="ital">They say unto him, The son of David </span>— This was the common title of the Messiah in that day, which the scribes taught them to give him, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/89-35.htm" title="Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie to David....">Psalm 89:35-36</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm" title="And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots:">Isaiah 11:1</a>.” <span class="ital">He saith, How then doth David in spirit, </span>rather, <span class="ital">by the Spirit; </span>that is, by inspiration; <span class="ital">call him Lord </span>— If he be merely the son, or descendant of David? if he be, as you suppose, the son of man, a mere man? “The doctors, it seems, did not look for any thing in their Messiah more excellent than the most exalted perfections of human nature; for, though they called him the Son of God, they had no notion that he was God, and so could offer no solution of the difficulty. Yet the latter question might have shown them their error. For if the Messiah was to be only a secular prince, as they supposed, ruling the men of his own time, he never could have been called <span class="ital">Lord </span>by persons who died before he was born; far less would so mighty a king as David, who also was his progenitor, have called him <span class="ital">Lord. </span>Wherefore, since he rules over, not the vulgar dead only of former ages, but even over the kings from whom he was himself descended, and his kingdom comprehends the men of all countries and times, past, present, and to come, the doctors, if they had thought accurately upon the subject, should have expected in their Messiah a king different from all other kings whatever. Besides, he is to sit at God’s right hand <span class="ital">till his enemies are made the footstool of his feet; </span>made thoroughly subject unto him. Numbers of Christ’s enemies are subjected to him in this life; and they who will not bow to him willingly, shall, like the rebellious subjects of other kingdoms, be reduced by punishment. Being constituted universal judge, all, whether friends or enemies, shall appear before his tribunal, where by the highest exercise of kingly power, he shall doom each to his unchangeable state.” <span class="ital">And no man was able to answer him a word </span>— None of them could offer the least shadow of a solution to the difficulty which he had proposed. <span class="ital">Neither durst any man ask him any more questions </span>— “The repeated proofs which he had given of the prodigious depth of his understanding, had impressed them with such an opinion of his wisdom, that they judged it impossible to insnare him in his discourse. For which reason they left off attempting it, and from that day forth troubled him no more with their insidious questions.” — Macknight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/22.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>22:41-46 When Christ baffled his enemies, he asked what thoughts they had of the promised Messiah? How he could be the Son of David and yet his Lord? He quotes Ps 110:1. If the Christ was to be a mere man, who would not exist till many ages after David's death, how could his forefather call him Lord? The Pharisees could not answer it. Nor can any solve the difficulty except he allows the Messiah to be the Son of God, and David's Lord equally with the Father. He took upon him human nature, and so became God manifested in the flesh; in this sense he is the Son of man and the Son of David. It behoves us above all things seriously to inquire, What think we of Christ? Is he altogether glorious in our eyes, and precious to our hearts? May Christ be our joy, our confidence, our all. May we daily be made more like to him, and more devoted to his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jesus proposes a question concerning the Messiah - See also <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/12-35.htm">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/20-41.htm">Luke 20:41-44</a>.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-41.htm">Matthew 22:41</a><p>While the Pharisees ... - Jesus, having confounded the great sects of the Jews, proceeds, in his turn, to propose to them a question for their solution.<p>This was done, not for the purpose of vain parade and triumph, but:<p>1. to show them how ignorant they were of their prophecies.<p>2. to humble them in view of their ignorance.<p>3. to bring to their attention the true doctrine respecting the Messiah - his being possessed of a character superior to that of David, the most mighty king of Israel - being his Lord, at the same time that he was his descendant.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 22:41-46.

According to de Wette, the object was: to awaken a higher idea of His (non-political) mission (Neander, Baumgarten-Crusius, Bleek, Schenkel, Keim). This view, however, is not favoured by the context, which represents Jesus as victor over His impudent and crafty foes, who are silenced and then subjected to the castigation described in ch. 23.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/22.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,...">Matthew 22:41-46</a>. <span class="ital">Counter question of Jesus</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/mark/12-35.htm" title="And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the son of David?...">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/20-41.htm" title="And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David's son?...">Luke 20:41-44</a>).—Not meant merely to puzzle or silence foes, or even to hint a mysterious doctrine as to the Speaker’s person, but to make Pharisees and scribes, and Sanhedrists generally, revise their whole ideas of the Messiah and the Messianic kingdom, which had led them to reject Him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/22.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-41.htm" title="While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,">Matthew 22:41</a>. <span class="greekheb">Συνηγμένων δὲ τῶν Φαρισαίων</span>, <span class="ital">but while the Pharisees were gathered together</span>) sc. solemnly; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-34.htm" title="But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence, they were gathered together.">Matthew 22:34</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 41-46.</span> - <span class="accented">Christ's question to the Pharisees concerning the Messiah.</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-35.htm">Mark 12:35-37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-41.htm">Luke 20:41-44</a>.) <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 41.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Jesus asked them.</span> He spake generally to the assembled crowd in the temple (Mark), addressing no one in particular. The questioned becomes the questioner, and this with a great purpose. He had silenced his opponents, and opened profundities in Scripture hitherto unfathomed; he would now raise them to a higher theology; he would place before them a truth concerning the nature of the Messiah, which, if they received it, would lead them to accept him. It was as it were a last hope. He and the Pharisees had some common ground, which was wanting in the case of the Sadducees and Herodians (comp <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-6.htm">Acts 23:6</a>); he would use this to support a last appeal. Let us observe the Divine patience and tenderness of Christ. Not to gain a victory over inveterate enemies, not to expose the ignorance of scribe and Pharisee, not to exhibit his own profound knowledge of the inner harmonies of God's Word, does he now put this question. He desires to win acceptance of his claims by the unanswerable argument of the Scripture which they revered; let them consider the exact meaning of a text often quoted, let them weigh each word with reverent care, and they would see that the predicted Messiah was not merely Son of David according to earthly descent, but was Jehovah himself; and that when he claimed to be Son of God, when he asserted, "I and my Father are one," he was vindicating for himself only what the prophet had affirmed of the nature of the Christ. He had, so to speak, hope that some among his hearers would accept this teaching, and save themselves amid that untoward generation. It was when this last hope failed, when he saw nothing but hardened hearts and wilful prejudice, that he uttered the woes and predictions in the following chapter. </body></html>
