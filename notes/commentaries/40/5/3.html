In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a> there is no such qualifying clause, and there the words speak of outward poverty, as in itself a less perilous and therefore happier state than that of riches. Here the blessedness is that of those who, whatever their outward state may be, are in their inward life as those who feel that they have nothing of their own, must be receivers before they give, must be dependent on another’s bounty, and be, as it were, the “bedesmen” of the great King. To that temper of mind belongs the “kingdom of heaven,” the eternal realities, in this life and the life to come, of that society of which Christ is the Head. Things are sometimes best understood by their contraries, and we may point to the description of the church of Laodicea as showing us the opposite type of character, thinking itself “rich” in the spiritual life, when it is really as “the pauper,” destitute of the true riches, blind and naked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Blessed are the poor in spirit </span>— The word <span class="greekheb">μακαριοι</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">blessed, </span>properly means <span class="ital">happy, </span>and it may be better to translate it so, because our Lord seems to intimate by it, not only that the dispositions here recommended are the way to future blessedness, but that they immediately confer the truest and most noble felicity. As happiness was the great end to which the wisest philosophers undertook to conduct their hearers, and as it is our common aim, and an object to the pursuit of which we are continually urged by an innate instinct, our Lord, whose great business in coming into the world was, to make mankind happy by making them holy, wisely and graciously begins his divine institution, which is the complete art of happiness, by pointing out the necessary connexion it has with holiness, and inciting to the latter by motives drawn from the former. In doing this we cannot but observe his benevolent condescension. He seems, as it were, to lay aside his supreme authority as our legislator, that he may the better act the part of our friend and Saviour. Instead of using the lofty style in positive commands, he, in a more gentle and engaging way, insinuates his will and our duty by pronouncing those happy who comply with it. And, in order to render his hearers more attentive, he proposes his doctrine in certain paradoxical dogmas, which, at first sight, may seem false to such as judge by appearance, but which, when attentively considered, are found to be most true. Indeed, as an old writer remarks, “All the beatitudes are affixed to unlikely conditions, to show that the judgment of the <span class="ital">word </span>and of the <span class="ital">world </span>are contrary.” By this expression, <span class="ital">the poor in spirit, </span>Grotius and Baxter understand those who bear a state of poverty and want with a disposition of quiet and cheerful submission to the divine will; and Mr. Mede interprets it of those who are ready to part with their possessions for charitable uses. But it seems much more probable that the truly humble are intended, or those who are sensible of their spiritual poverty, of their ignorance and sinfulness, their guilt, depravity, and weakness, their frailty and mortality; and who, therefore, whatever their outward situation in life may be, however affluent and exalted, think meanly of themselves, and neither desire the praise of men, nor covet high things in the world, but are content with the lot God assigns them, however low and poor. These are happy, because their humility renders them teachable, submissive, resigned, patient, contented, and cheerful in all estates; and it enables them to receive prosperity or adversity, health or sickness, ease or pain, life or death, with an equal mind. Whatever is allotted them short of those everlasting burnings which they see they have merited, they consider as a grace or favour. They are happy, because <span class="ital">theirs is the kingdom of heaven </span>— The present, inward kingdom, <span class="ital">righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost, </span>as well as the eternal kingdom, if they endure to the end. The knowledge which they have of themselves, and their humiliation of soul before God, prepare them for the reception of Christ, to dwell and reign in their hearts, and all the other blessings of the gospel; the blessings both of grace and glory. <span class="ital">For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place: with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-15.htm" title="For thus said the high and lofty One that inhabits eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones.">Isaiah 57:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-2.htm" title="For all those things has my hand made, and all those things have been, said the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.">Isaiah 66:2</a>.

The poor in spirit are happy. These bring their minds to their condition, when it is a low condition. They are humble and lowly in their own eyes. They see their want, bewail their guilt, and thirst after a Redeemer. The kingdom of grace is of such; the kingdom of glory is for them. 2. Those that mourn are happy. That godly sorrow which worketh true repentance, watchfulness, a humble mind, and continual dependence for acceptance on the mercy of God in Christ Jesus, with constant seeking the Holy Spirit, to cleanse away the remaining evil, seems here to be intended. Heaven is the joy of our Lord; a mountain of joy, to which our way is through a vale of tears. Such mourners shall be comforted by their God. 3. The meek are happy. The meek are those who quietly submit to God; who can bear insult; are silent, or return a soft answer; who, in their patience, keep possession of their own souls, when they can scarcely keep possession of anything else. These meek ones are happy, even in this world. Meekness promotes wealth, comfort, and safety, even in this world. 4. Those who hunger and thirst after righteousness are happy. Righteousness is here put for all spiritual blessings. These are purchased for us by the righteousness of Christ, confirmed by the faithfulness of God. Our desires of spiritual blessings must be earnest. Though all desires for grace are not grace, yet such a desire as this, is a desire of God's own raising, and he will not forsake the work of his own hands. 5. The merciful are happy. We must not only bear our own afflictions patiently, but we must do all we can to help those who are in misery. We must have compassion on the souls of others, and help them; pity those who are in sin, and seek to snatch them as brands out of the burning. 6. The pure in heart are happy; for they shall see God. Here holiness and happiness are fully described and put together. The heart must be purified by faith, and kept for God. Create in me such a clean heart, O God. None but the pure are capable of seeing God, nor would heaven be happiness to the impure. As God cannot endure to look upon their iniquity, so they cannot look upon his purity. 7. The peace-makers are happy. They love, and desire, and delight in peace; and study to be quiet. They keep the peace that it be not broken, and recover it when it is broken. If the peace-makers are blessed, woe to the peace-breakers! 8. Those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake are happy. This saying is peculiar to Christianity; and it is more largely insisted upon than any of the rest. Yet there is nothing in our sufferings that can merit of God; but God will provide that those who lose for him, though life itself, shall not lose by him in the end. Blessed Jesus! how different are thy maxims from those of men of this world! They call the proud happy, and admire the gay, the rich, the powerful, and the victorious. May we find mercy from the Lord; may we be owned as his children, and inherit his kingdom. With these enjoyments and hopes, we may cheerfully welcome low or painful circumstances.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Blessed are the poor in spirit - The word "blessed" means "happy," referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come.<p>Poor in spirit - Luke says simply, Blessed are the poor. It has been disputed whether Christ meant the poor in reference to the things of this life, or to the humble. The gospel is said to be preached to the poor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-5.htm">Matthew 11:5</a>. It was predicted that the Messiah would preach to the poor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1</a>. It is said that they have special facilities for being saved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-23.htm">Matthew 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-24.htm">Luke 18:24</a>. The state of such persons is therefore comparatively blessed, or happy. Riches produce care, anxiety, and dangers, and not the least is the danger of losing heaven by them. To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands; to be willing to be in his hands, and to feel that we deserve no favor from him. It is opposed to pride, and vanity, and ambition. Such are happy:<p>1. Because there is more real enjoyment in thinking of ourselves as we are, than in being filled with pride and vanity.<p>2. Because such Jesus chooses to bless, and on them he confers his favors here.<p>3. Because theirs will be the kingdom of heaven hereafter.<p>It is remarkable that Jesus began his ministry in this manner, so unlike all others. Other teachers had taught that happiness was to be found in honor, or riches, or splendor, or sensual pleasure. Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life.<p>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven - That is, either they have special facilities for entering the kingdom of heaven, and of becoming Christians here, or they shall enter heaven hereafter. Both these ideas are probably included. A state of poverty a state where we are despised or unhonored by people is a state where people are most ready to seek the comforts of religion here, and a home in the heavens hereafter. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-2.htm">Matthew 2:2</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Blessed&#8212;Of the two words which our translators render "blessed," the one here used points more to what is inward, and so might be rendered "happy," in a lofty sense; while the other denotes rather what comes to us from without (as Mt 25:34). But the distinction is not always clearly carried out. One Hebrew word expresses both. On these precious Beatitudes, observe that though eight in number, there are here but seven distinct features of character. The eighth one&#8212;the "persecuted for righteousness' sake"&#8212;denotes merely the possessors of the seven preceding features, on account of which it is that they are persecuted (2Ti 3:12). Accordingly, instead of any distinct promise to this class, we have merely a repetition of the first promise. This has been noticed by several critics, who by the sevenfold character thus set forth have rightly observed that a complete character is meant to be depicted, and by the sevenfold blessedness attached to it, a perfect blessedness is intended. Observe, again, that the language in which these Beatitudes are couched is purposely fetched from the Old Testament, to show that the new kingdom is but the old in a new form; while the characters described are but the varied forms of that spirituality which was the essence of real religion all along, but had well-nigh disappeared under corrupt teaching. Further, the things here promised, far from being mere arbitrary rewards, will be found in each case to grow out of the characters to which they are attached, and in their completed form are but the appropriate coronation of them. Once more, as "the kingdom of heaven," which is the first and the last thing here promised, has two stages&#8212;a present and a future, an initial and a consummate stage&#8212;so the fulfilment of each of these promises has two stages&#8212;a present and a future, a partial and a perfect stage.<p>3. Blessed are the poor in spirit&#8212;All familiar with Old Testament phraseology know how frequently God's true people are styled "the poor" (the "oppressed," "afflicted," "miserable") or "the needy"&#8212;or both together (as in Ps 40:17; Isa 41:17). The explanation of this lies in the fact that it is generally "the poor of this world" who are "rich in faith" (Jas 2:5; compare 2Co 6:10; Re 2:9); while it is often "the ungodly" who "prosper in the world" (Ps 73:12). Accordingly, in Lu 6:20, 21, it seems to be this class&#8212;the literally "poor" and "hungry"&#8212;that are specially addressed. But since God's people are in so many places styled "the poor" and "the needy," with no evident reference to their temporal circumstances (as in Ps 68:10; 69:29-33; 132:15; Isa 61:1; 66:2), it is plainly a frame of mind which those terms are meant to express. Accordingly, our translators sometimes render such words "the humble" (Ps 10:12, 17), "the meek" (Ps 22:26), "the lowly" (Pr 3:34), as having no reference to outward circumstances. But here the explanatory words, "in spirit," fix the sense to "those who in their deepest consciousness realize their entire need" (compare the Greek of Lu 10:21; Joh 11:33; 13:21; Ac 20:22; Ro 12:11; 1Co 5:3; Php 3:3). This self-emptying conviction, that "before God we are void of everything," lies at the foundation of all spiritual excellence, according to the teaching of Scripture. Without it we are inaccessible to the riches of Christ; with it we are in the fitting state for receiving all spiritual supplies (Re 3:17, 18; Mt 9:12, 13).<p>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven&#8212;(See on [1224]Mt 3:2). The poor in spirit not only shall have&#8212;they already have&#8212;the kingdom. The very sense of their poverty is begun riches. While others "walk in a vain show"&#8212;"in a shadow," "an image"&#8212;in an unreal world, taking a false view of themselves and all around them&#8212;the poor in spirit are rich in the knowledge of their real case. Having courage to look this in the face, and own it guilelessly, they feel strong in the assurance that "unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness" (Ps 112:4); and soon it breaks forth as the morning. God wants nothing from us as the price of His saving gifts; we have but to feel our universal destitution, and cast ourselves upon His compassion (Job 33:27, 28; 1Jo 1:9). So the poor in spirit are enriched with the fulness of Christ, which is the kingdom in substance; and when He shall say to them from His great white throne, "Come, ye blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you," He will invite them merely to the full enjoyment of an already possessed inheritance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Happy are they, who, though they be not rich in this world’s goods, yet have a spirit suited to their state and condition, not looking for their consolation here, but, having a poor and low opinion of the world and all that is therein, looking after more excellent riches; and, in order to it, are of broken and contrite spirits for their manifold sins, and cannot entertain any proud opinion of their own righteousness, but flee unto the free grace of God, and the righteousness of the Lord Jesus Christ. Not the great, and rich, and proud men of the world are happy, but these are the blessed men; for true happiness lieth not in worldly possessions, but in the favour of God, and a right to the kingdom of heaven, and that these men have, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/34-18.htm" title="The LORD is near to them that are of a broken heart; and saves such as be of a contrite spirit.">Psalm 34:18</a> 51:17 <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/66-2.htm" title="For all those things has my hand made, and all those things have been, said the LORD: but to this man will I look, even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembles at my word.">Isaiah 66:2</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Blessed are the poor in spirit,.... Not the poor in purse, or who are so with respect to things temporal: for though God has chosen and called many, who are in such a condition of life, yet not all; the kingdom of heaven cannot be said to belong to them all, or only; but such as are poor in a spiritual sense. All mankind are spiritually poor; they have nothing to eat that is fit and proper; nor any clothes to wear, but rags; nor are they able to purchase either; they have no money to buy with; they are in debt, owe ten thousand talents, and have nothing to pay; and in such a condition, that they are not able to help themselves. The greater part of mankind are insensible of this their condition; but think themselves rich, and increased with goods: there are some who are sensible of it, who see their poverty and want, freely acknowledge it, bewail it, and mourn over it; are humbled for it, and are broken under a sense of it; entertain low and mean thoughts of themselves; seek after the true riches, both of grace and glory; and frankly acknowledge, that all they have, or hope to have, is owing to the free grace of God. Now these are the persons intended in this place; who are not only "poor", but are poor "in spirit"; in their own spirits, in their own sense, apprehension, and judgment: and may even be called "beggars", as the word may be rendered; for being sensible of their poverty, they place themselves at the door of mercy, and knock there; their language is, "God be merciful"; their posture is standing, watching, and waiting, at wisdom's gates, and at the posts of her door; they are importunate, will have no denial, yet receive the least favour with thankfulness. Now these are pronounced "blessed", for this reason, <p>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; not only the Gospel, and the ministration of it, which belongs to them. "The poor have the Gospel preached": it not only reaches their ears, but their hearts; it enters into them, is applied unto them, they receive and embrace it with the utmost joy and gladness; but eternal glory, this is prepared for them, and given to them; they are born heirs of it, have a right unto it, are making meet for it, and shall enjoy it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Blessed <i>are</i> the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> poor in <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</span><p>(a) Under the name of poverty are meant all the miseries, that are joined with poverty.<p>(b) Whose minds and spirits are brought under control, and tamed, and obey God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:3-10</a>. <span class="ital">The beatitudes in general</span>, in order to set forth, first, in a general way, the moral conditions of future participation in the Messiah’s kingdom.—“That is, indeed, a fine, sweet, friendly beginning of His teaching and sermon.

Older Catholics (Maldonatus and Corn. a Lapide), after Clement of Alexandria and many Fathers, taking <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span> of the <span class="ital">self-determination</span>, misused our passage in support of the vow of <span class="ital">voluntary poverty</span>. On the other hand, Calovius strikingly remarks: “Paupertas haec spiritualis non est <span class="ital">consilii</span>, sed <span class="ital">praecepti</span>.” <span class="ital">Others</span> (Olearius, Michaelis, Paulus) connect <span class="greekheb">τῷ πνεύματι</span> with <span class="greekheb">μακάριοι</span>: <span class="ital">the poor are spiritually happy</span>. Opposed to this is the position of the words and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>. Moreover, no example is found in the N. T. or in the Jewish writings, where, in the case of beatitudes, to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΑΚΆΡΙΟς</span></span></span>, or <span class="greekheb">אַשְׁרֵי</span>, or <span class="greekheb">טֹוּבֵי</span>, any more precise designation of fortune was immediately subjoined.

Some general observations may helpfully introduce the detailed exegesis of these golden words.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. They breathe the spirit of the scene. On the mountain tops away from the bustle and the sultry heat of the region below, the air cool, the blue sky overhead, quiet all around, and divine tranquillity within. We are near heaven here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. The originality of these sayings has been disputed, especially by modern Jews desirous to credit their Rabbis with such good things. Some of them, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, the third, may be found in substance in the Psalter, and possibly many, or all of them, even in the Talmud. But what then? They are in the Talmud as a few grains of wheat lost in a vast heap of chaff. The originality of Jesus lies in putting the due value on these thoughts, collecting them, and making them as prominent as the Ten Commandments. No greater service can be rendered to mankind than to rescue from obscurity neglected moral commonplaces.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. The existence of another version of the discourse (in Lk.), with varying forms of the sayings, has raised a question as to the original form. Did Christ, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, say “Blessed the poor” (Lk.) or “Blessed the poor in spirit” (Matt.)? This raises a larger question as to the manner of Christ’s teaching on the hill. Suppose one day in a week of instruction was devoted to the subject of happiness, its conditions, and heirs, many things might be said on each leading proposition. The theme would be announced, then accompanied with expansions. A modern biographer would have prefaced a discourse like this with an introductory account of the Teacher’s method. There is no such account in the Gospels, but there are incidental notices from which we can learn somewhat. The disciples asked questions and the Master answered them. Jesus explained some of His parables to the twelve. From certain parts of His teaching, as reported, it appears that He not only uttered great thoughts in aphoristic form, but occasionally enlarged. The Sermon on the Mount contains at least two instances of such enlargement. The thesis, “I am not come to destroy but to fulfil” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a>), is copiously illustrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:...">Matthew 5:21-48</a>). The counsel against care, which as a thesis might be stated thus: “Blessed are the care-free,” is amply expanded (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison....">Matthew 5:25-34</a>). Even in one of the Beatitudes we find traces of explanatory enlargement; in the last, “Blessed are the persecuted”. It is perhaps the most startling of all the paradoxes, and would need enlargement greatly, and some parts of the expansion have been preserved (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:10-12</a>). On this view both forms of the first Beatitude might be authentic, the one as theme, the other as comment. The theme would always be put in the fewest possible words; the first Beatitude therefore, as Luke puts it, <span class="greekheb">Μακάριοι οἱ πτωχοί</span>, Matthew preserving one of the expansions, not necessarily the only one. Of course, another view of the expansion is possible, that it proceeded not from Christ, but from the transmitters of His sayings. But this hypothesis is not a whit more legitimate or likely than the other. I make this observation, not in the spirit of an antiquated Harmonistic, but simply as a contribution to historical criticism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>4. Each Beatitude has a reason annexed, that of the first being “for theirs is the kingdom of heaven”. They vary in the different Beatitudes as reported. It is conceivable that in the original themes the reason annexed to the first was common to them all. It was understood to be repeated like the refrain of a song, or like the words, “him do I call a Brahmana,” annexed to many of the moral sentences in the Footsteps of the Law in the Buddhist Canon. “He who, when assailed, does not resist, but speaks mildly to his tormentors—him do I call a Brahmana.” So “Blessed the poor, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven”, “blessed they who mourn, for,” etc.; “blessed the meek, the hungry, for,” etc. The actual reasons annexed, when they vary from the refrain, are to be viewed as explanatory comments.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>5. It has been maintained that only certain of the Beatitudes belong to the authentic discourse on the mount, the rest, possibly based on true <span class="ital">logia</span> of Jesus spoken at another time, being added by the evangelist, true to his habit of massing the teaching of Jesus in topical groups. This is the view of Weiss (in Matt. Evan., and in Meyer). He thinks only three are authentic—the first, third, and fourth—all pointing to the righteousness of the kingdom as the <span class="ital">summum bonum</span>: the first to righteousness as not yet possessed; the second to the want as a cause of sorrow; the third to righteousness as an object of desire. This view goes with the theory that Christ’s discourse on the hill had reference exclusively to the nature of true and false righteousness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>6. A final much less important question in reference to the Beatitudes is that which relates to their number. One would say at a first glance eight, counting <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a> as one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake....">Matthew 5:11-12</a> being an enlargement. The traditional number, however, is seven<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>A. The Subjects of the Kingdom, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:3-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1)&emsp;&emsp;Their character and privileges, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:3-12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Blessed are the poor in spirit</span>] The beatitudes—so called from the opening word “beati” (blessed), in the Vulgate. Mark the Christian growth step by step. First, spiritual poverty, the only character which is receptive of repentance, therefore alone admissible into the Kingdom. Secondly, sadness for sin. Thirdly, meekness, implying submission to the will of God, a characteristic of Jesus Himself, who says “I am meek and lowly in heart.” Fourthly, the soul-hunger for righteousness. Then three virtues of the Christian life, each of which wins, without seeking it, a reward in an ascending scale—mercy, purity, peacemaking. (It is a little remarkable that the English language supplies no abstract term to express this last, the highest grace of the Christian life.) The last two beatitudes <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:10-11</a> may be regarded as encouragements to the disciples, and as tests of their true discipleship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">poor in spirit</span>] Opposed to the spiritually proud, the just who need no repentance. St Luke omits “in spirit,” showing that the literal poor are primarily meant, St Matthew shows that they are not exclusively meant.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μακάριοι</span>, <span class="ital">blessed</span>) This initial word, so often repeated, indicates the object of Christ’s teaching.[170] By means, however, of striking paradoxes, blessedness is proposed not only by itself, but inasmuch as, <span class="ital">in Christ now present</span>, it is within the reach of all who are capable of receiving Him. There were some such amongst our Lord’s auditors, though undistinguished by the eye of man (see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-36.htm" title="But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd....">Matthew 9:36-37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm" title="The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 29:19</a>), although compared with the rest they were not many in number: for the epithet <span class="ital">blessed</span> frequently implies both the excellence and rarity of a thing (as in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/31-8.htm" title="Blessed is the rich that is found without blemish, and hath not gone after gold.">Sir 31:8</a>), from which the expressions, <span class="ital">theirs, they</span>, etc., exclude those otherwise disposed: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation....">Luke 6:24-26</a>, where the <span class="ital">woes</span> are denounced. Seven however of the <span class="greekheb">μακαρισμοὶ</span>, or <span class="ital">predications of blessedness</span>, are <span class="ital">absolute</span>, declaring the condition of the godly, as far as regards themselves; two are <span class="ital">relative</span>, having respect to the conduct of men towards them. In both cases the <span class="ital">kingdom of heaven</span> is placed first, as embracing the whole of the beatitudes. All are enumerated in a most beautiful order. With these may be compared the matter and order of the eight woes, which are denounced against the Scribes and Pharisees, in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-13.htm" title="But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for you neither go in yourselves, neither suffer you them that are entering to go in....">Matthew 23:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought you to have done, and not to leave the other undone.">Matthew 23:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-25.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you make clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within they are full of extortion and excess.">Matthew 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you are like to white washed sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness.">Matthew 23:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-29.htm" title="Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because you build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of the righteous,">Matthew 23:29</a>. In both cases mention is made of the <span class="ital">kingdom of heaven</span>, here <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:3</a>, there <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men.">Matthew 5:13</a>; of <span class="ital">mercy</span>, here <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-7.htm" title="Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.">Matthew 5:7</a>, there <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-23.htm" title="Therefore if you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has ought against you;">Matthew 5:23</a>; of <span class="ital">purity</span>, here <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, there <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a>; and of <span class="ital">persecution</span>, here <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:10-11</a>, and there <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell....">Matthew 5:29-30</a> : and undoubtedly the other clauses may also be respectively compared with each other. In the <span class="ital">subject</span>, the saints are described as they are <span class="ital">now</span> in <span class="ital">this life;</span> in the <span class="ital">predicate</span>, as they will be <span class="ital">hereafter</span> on <span class="ital">that day</span>: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-25.htm" title="Woe to you that are full! for you shall hunger.

Our Lord, however, frames His words in such a manner, as at the same time to intimate the blessedness of <span class="ital">individual</span> saints already commencing in the present life, and to signify prophetically the blessedness of the holy <span class="ital">people</span>, which will hereafter be theirs also upon <span class="ital">earth:</span> see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm" title="Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.">Matthew 5:5</a>.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ πτωχοὶ</span>, <span class="ital">the poor</span>) A vocative, either expressly or such in meaning (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm" title="And he lifted up his eyes on his disciples, and said, Blessed be you poor: for yours is the kingdom of God.">Luke 6:20</a>). Nor does the pronoun <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>, <span class="ital">their</span>, oppose this view. Cf. Gnomon on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>. <span class="ital">Poverty</span> is the first foundation. <span class="ital">He is poor</span>, who has it not in his power to say, <span class="ital">this is mine</span>;[171] and who, when he has anything for the present, does not devise what he will have for the future, but depends on the liberality of another. The riches which are disclaimed by such poverty, are either spiritual or natural, and are either present or absent. Such cardinal and fundamental virtues are despised by the world: whereas those which the world admires as such, are either no virtues, or false ones, or merely the offshoots and appendages of Christian virtues.—<span class="greekheb">ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΙ</span>, <span class="ital">in spirit) i.e.</span> in their inmost self. This word is to be understood also in the following passages as far as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-8.htm" title="Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.">Matthew 5:8</a>, where the words <span class="greekheb">τῇ καρδίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">in heart</span>, occur.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, <span class="ital">because</span>) Each kind of blessedness which is predicated corresponds with the previous description of [the character or condition which is] its subject,[172] and is taken, either (1.) from <span class="ital">the contrary</span> (for the works of God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-6.htm" title="For God, who commanded the light to shine out of darkness, has shined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.">2 Corinthians 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-6.htm" title="Nevertheless God, that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus;">2 Corinthians 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-9.htm" title="And he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you: for my strength is made perfect in weakness.

Assent is useless if it becomes not action (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm">Matthew 7:24-27</a>). There is little doubt that the two accounts (here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a>.) represent one and the same discourse, the main arguments for this belief being thus given by Ellicott ('Hist. Lects.,' p. 179): "That the beginning and end of the Sermon are nearly identical in both Gospels; that the precepts, as recited by St. Luke, are in the same general order as those in St. Matthew, and that they are often expressed in nearly the same words; and lastly, that each Evangelist specifies the same miracle, viz. the healing of the centurion's servant, as having taken place shortly after the Sermon, on our Lord's entry into Capernaum." <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 3-16.</span> - 1. <span class="accented">The ideal character of his disciples.</span> <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Blessed</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); Vulgate, <span class="accented">beati</span>; hence "Beatitudes." The word describes "the poor in spirit," etc., not as recipients of blessing (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>) from God, or even from men, but as possessors of "happiness" (cf. the Authorized Version of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/13-17.htm">John 13:17</a>, and frequently). It describes them in reference to their inherent state, not to the gifts or the rewards that they receive. It thus answers in thought to the common <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5e8;&#x5d9;</span> of the Old Testament; <span class="accented">e.g.</span>  <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-8.htm">1 Kings 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/1-1.htm">Psalm 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm">Psalm 32:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm">Psalm 84:5</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs, is the kingdom of heaven.</span> The first Beatitude is the sum and substance of the whole sermon. Poverty of spirit stands in contrast to self sufficiency (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/3-17.htm">Revelation 3:17</a>) and as such is perhaps the quality which is most of all opposed to the Jewish temper in all ages (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-17.htm">Romans 2:17-20</a>). For in this, as in much else, the Jewish nation is the type of the human race since the Fall. Observe that vers. 3, 4 (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;</span>, possibly also ver. 5, <span class="accented">vide infra</span>) recall <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-1.htm">Isaiah 61:1, 2</a>. As recently in the synagogue at Nazareth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-18.htm">Luke 4:18, 19</a>), so also here, he bases the explanation of his work on the prophecy of that work in the Book of Isaiah. The poor (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>). <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, in classical and philosophical usage, implies a lower degree of poverty than <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-9.htm">2 Corinthians 9:9</a> and LXX.). "The <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> may be so poor that he earns his bread by daily labour; but the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> is so poor that he only obtains his living by begging The <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> has nothing superfluous, the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> nothing at all" (Trench, 'Syn.,' &sect; 36.). Hence Tertullian ('Adv. Marc.,' 4:14; cf. 15)purposely altered <span class="accented">Beati pauperes</span> of the Old Latin to <span class="accented">Beati mendici</span>, and elsewhere ('De Idol.,' 12) rendered it by <span class="accented">egeni.</span> But in Hellenistic Greek, so far as the usage of the LXX. and the Hexapla goes (<span class="accented">vide</span> Hatch, 'Biblical Greek,' p. 73), the distinction seems hardly to hold good. Hatch even infers - on, we think, very insufficient premisses  -  that these two words, with <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span> (but <span class="accented">vide infra</span>), designate the poor of an oppressed country, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the peasantry, the <span class="accented">fellahin</span> of Palestine as a class, and he considers it probable that this special meaning underlies the use of the words in these verses. Whether this be the case or not, the addition of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span> completely excludes the supposition that our <span class="accented">Lord</span> meant to refer to any merely external circumstances. <span class="accented">In spirit</span>; Matthew only (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;</span>). Dative of sphere (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-34.htm">1 Corinthians 7:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-11.htm">Romans 12:11</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm">James 2:5</a> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;</span>) forms an apparent rather than a real contrast; for the dative there marks, not the sphere in which, but the object with reference to which, the poverty is felt ("the poor as to the world," Revised Version; Wiesinger in Huther), or possibly the object which is the standard of comparison, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> in the judgment of the world (Winer, &sect; 31:4, <span class="accented">a</span>). Christ here affirms the blessedness of those who are in their spirit absolutely devoid of wealth. It cannot mean that they are this in God's opinion, for in God's opinion all are so. It means, therefore, that they are this in their own opinion. While many feel in themselves a wealth of soul-satisfaction, these do not, but realize their insufficiency. Christ says that they realize this "in (their) spirit;" for the spirit is that part of us which specially craves for satisfaction, and which is the means by which we lay hold of true satisfaction. The actual craving for spiritual wealth is not mentioned in this verse. It is implied, but direct mention of it comes partly in ver. 4, and especially in ver. 6. <span class="accented">For theirs.</span> Emphatic, as in all the Beatitudes (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>,). <span class="accented">Is.</span> Not hereafter (Meyer), but even already. <span class="accented">The kingdom of heaven</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> note, p. 150). The poor in spirit already belong to and have a share in that realm of God which now is realized chiefly in relation to our spirit, but ultimately will be realized in relation to every element of our nature, and to all other persons, and to every part, animate and inanimate, of the whole world. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Blessed (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;)<p>As this word and its cognates occur at least fifty-five times in the New Testament, it is important to understand its history, which is interesting because it is one of those numerous words which exhibit the influence of Christian association and usage in enlarging and dignifying their meaning. It is commonly rendered blessed, both in the A. V. and Rev., and that rendering might properly be given it in every instance.<p>Its root is supposed to be a word meaning great, and its earlier meaning appears to be limited to outward prosperity; so that it is used at times as synonymous with rich. It scarcely varies from this meaning in its frequent applications to the Grecian gods, since the popular Greek ideal of divine blessedness was not essentially moral. The gods were blessed because of their power and dignity, not because of their holiness. "In general," says Mr. Gladstone ("Homer and the Homeric Age") "the chief note of deity with Homer is emancipation from the restraints of moral law. Though the Homeric gods have not yet ceased to be the vindicators of morality upon earth, they have personally ceased to observe its rules, either for or among themselves. As compared with men, in conduct they are generally characterized by superior force and intellect, but by inferior morality."<p>In its peculiar application to the dead, there is indicated the despair of earthly happiness underlying the thought of even the cheerful and mercurial Greek. Hence the word was used as synonymous with dead. Only the dead could be called truly blessed. Thus Sophocles ("Oedipus Tyrannus"):<p>"From hence the lesson learn ye<p>To reckon no man happy till ye witness<p>The closing day; until he pass the border<p>Which severs life from death, unscathed by sorrow."<p>And again ("Oedipus at Colonus"):<p>"Happiest beyond compare,<p>Never to taste of life:<p>Happiest in order next,<p>Being born, with quickest speed<p>Thither again to turn<p>continued...</body></html>
