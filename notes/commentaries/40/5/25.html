The man whom we have wronged appears as the “adversary,” the prosecutor bringing his charge against us. The impulse of the natural man at such a time, even if conscious of wrong, is to make the best of his case, to prevaricate, to recriminate. The truer wisdom, Christ teaches, is to “agree”—better, <span class= "ital">to be on good terms with</span>—show our own good will, and so win his. The whole teaching, it is obvious, is addressed to one who <span class= "ital">has</span> done wrong. The treatment of a false charge involves different considerations.<p><span class= "bld">The officer.</span>—In this case, the officer of the court, the gaoler.<p>In the application of the words, the judge is clearly God, and the officers, those (angels or others) who execute His judgment, and the “adversary,” those whom we have wronged, leaving the wrong unredressed. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-8.htm" title="Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, walks about, seeking whom he may devour:">1Peter 5:8</a> the devil is described as the great “adversary,” and that meaning is, perhaps, not excluded, though it is not prominent, here. Any evil deed becomes in the end as an accusing Satan, bearing its witness against us; and Satan himself is the embodiment of all such accusers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-25.htm" title="Agree with your adversary quickly, whiles you are in the way with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and you be cast into prison.">Matthew 5:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Agree, </span>&c. — Here our Lord enforces the preceding exhortation, from the consideration of what is reckoned prudent in ordinary quarrel and law-suits. “In such cases, wise men always advise the party that has done wrong to make up matters with his adversary while it is in his power, lest the sentence of a judge, being interposed, fall heavy on him. For the same reason, we, who have offended our brother, ought to make it up with him, while an opportunity of repentance is allowed us; and that though our quarrel should have proceeded to the greatest lengths, lest the sentence of the Supreme Judge overtake us, and put reconciliation out of our power for ever.” <span class="ital">With thine adversary quickly </span>— With any against whom thou hast thus offended; <span class="ital">whiles thou art in the way with him </span>— Going with him to a magistrate; or, instantly, on the spot; before you part. <span class="ital">Lest the adversary deliver thee to the judge </span>— To be tried before him; and the judge, deciding the cause against thee, <span class="ital">deliver thee to the officer </span>of the court, to keep thee in custody till satisfaction be made, and <span class="ital">thou be cast into prison </span>— Not being able to discharge an account enhanced with so many additional articles of expense. <span class="ital">Thou shalt by no means come out thence </span>— Be released out of prison; <span class="ital">till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing </span>— For thy antagonist, when he has got thee at such an advantage, will be more rigorous in his demands than before. And surely, if by impenitent wickedness thou makest thyself the prisoner of the divine justice, thy case will be yet more deplorable and hopeless. Understanding the words in a figurative sense, which is, partly at least, intended by Christ here, the prison is taken for <span class="ital">hell, </span>out of which the unrelenting sinner can never come, according to our Lord’s declaration, because he can never be able to make that satisfaction. “Lord, we are all the debtors, and, in one sense, the prisoners of thy justice, and of ourselves were most incapable, not only of <span class="ital">paying the uttermost farthing, </span>but even of discharging the least part of the debt! We bless thee for that generous Surety who has taken and discharged it for us; and by the price of whose atoning blood we are delivered from the chains of darkness, and are translated into the glorious liberty of thy children.” — Doddridge.

Thus they explained away its spiritual meaning. Christ showed the full meaning of this commandment; according to which we must be judged hereafter, and therefore ought to be ruled now. All rash anger is heart murder. By our brother, here, we are to understand any person, though ever so much below us, for we are all made of one blood. Raca, is a scornful word, and comes from pride: Thou fool, is a spiteful word, and comes from hatred. Malicious slanders and censures are poison that kills secretly and slowly. Christ told them that how light soever they made of these sins, they would certainly be called into judgment for them. We ought carefully to preserve Christian love and peace with all our brethren; and if at any time there is a quarrel, we should confess our fault, humble ourselves to our brother, making or offering satisfaction for wrong done in word or deed: and we should do this quickly; because, till this is done, we are unfit for communion with God in holy ordinances. And when we are preparing for any religious exercises, it is good for us to make that an occasion of serious reflection and self-examination. What is here said is very applicable to our being reconciled to God through Christ. While we are alive, we are in the way to his judgement-seat; after death, it will be too late. When we consider the importance of the case, and the uncertainty of life, how needful it is to seek peace with God, without delay!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Agree with thine adversary quickly - This is still an illustration of the sixth commandment. To be in hostility, to go to law, to be litigious, is a violation always, on one side or the other, of the law requiring us to love our neighbor, and our Saviour regards it as a violation of the sixth commandment. While you are in the way with him, says he, that is, while you are going to the court, before the trial has taken place, it is your duty, if possible, to come to an agreement. It is wrong to carry the contention to a court of law. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-6.htm">1 Corinthians 6:6-7</a>. The consequence of not being reconciled, he expresses in the language of courts. The adversary shall deliver to the judge, and he to the executioner, and he shall throw you into prison. He did not mean to say that this would be literally the way with God, but that His dealings with those that harbored these feelings, and would not be reconciled with their brethren, were represented by the punishment inflicted by human tribunals. That is, he would hold all such as violators of the sixth commandment, and would punish them accordingly.<p>There is no propriety in the use sometimes made of this verse, in representing God as the "adversary" of the sinner, and urging him to be reconciled to God while in the way to judgment. Nor does the phrase "thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing" refer to the eternity of future punishment. It is language taken from courts of justice, to illustrate the truth that God will punish people according to justice for not being reconciled to him. The punishment in the future world will be eternal indeed <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-46.htm">Matthew 25:46</a>, but this passage does not prove it.<p>Thine adversary - A man that is opposed to us in law. It here means a creditor; a man who has a just claim on us.<p>In the way with him - While you are going before the court. Before the trial comes on. It is remarkable that this very direction is found in the Roman law of the Twelve Tables, which expressly directed the plaintiff and defendant to make up the matter while they were in the way, or going to the praetor - in via, rem uti pacunt orato. - Blackstone's Commentary, iii. p. 299. Whether the Saviour had any reference to this cannot be determined. As the Roman laws prevailed to some extent in Palestine, however, it is possible that there was such an allusion.<p>The officer - The executioner; or, as we should say, the sheriff.<p>The uttermost farthing - The last farthing. All that is due. The farthing was a small coin used in Judea, equal to two mites. It was not quite equal to half a farthing of British money. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

These words are not to be understood in an allegorical sense, as if "the adversary" was the justice of God, demanding payment of debts; "the way", this present life; "the judge", God himself; "the officer", the devil; "the prison", the pit of hell; and "the uttermost farthing", the least sin, which will never be remitted without satisfaction: but the design of them is to prevent lawsuits about debts, which may be in dispute; it being much better for debtor and creditor, especially the former, to compose such differences among themselves, than to litigate the matter in a court of judicature. By "the adversary" is meant not an enemy, one that bears hatred and ill will, but a brother that has ought against a man; a creditor, who demands and insists upon payment of what is owing to him; and for this purpose has taken methods towards bringing the debtor before a proper magistrate, in order to oblige him to payment: wherefore it is better for him to make up and agree the matter directly, as soon as possible, <p>whilst thou art in the way with him; that is, whilst the creditor and debtor are going together to some inferior magistrate, or lesser court, as the sanhedrim, which consisted of three persons only, before whom such causes might be tried: for  , pecuniary causes, or causes relating to money matters, were tried "by the bench of three" (g): and the selfsame advice is given in the Talmud (h), as here, where it seems to be a common proverb; for it is said, <p>"there are men that say, or men usually say,    , "whilst thou art in the way with thine adversary, be obedient".'' <p>Lest at any time the adversary should deliver thee to the judge, a superior magistrate in a higher court; for if the creditor would, he could oblige the debtor to go with him to the supreme court of judicature, and try the cause there; for so say the Jewish (i); canons: <p>"if the creditor says we will go to the great sanhedrim, they compel the debtor, and he goes up with them, as it is said, "the borrower is servant to the lender",'' <p>where it might go harder with the poor debtor; and therefore it was advisable to prevent it by an agreement, lest <p>the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison, <p>"It was an affirmative command in the law, says Maimonides, to appoint "judges" and "officers" in every country and province, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-18.htm">Deuteronomy 16:18</a>.  "judges" they are the judges that are fixed in the sanhedrim, and such that engage in law suits come before them:  "officers"; these are the masters of the rod and scourge, i.e. who beat and scourge delinquents; and these stand before the judges--and all they do, is by the order of the judges.'' <p>Now it is one of these that is meant by "the officer"; in Munster's Hebrew Gospel, he is called  who, when he had authority from the judge, could cast into prison, and that for debt; of which we have no account in the law of Moses. <p>(g) Misn.

There is much more reason for regarding this passage as an interpolation. It is connected only externally (by the references to courts of law) with what goes before, and it is out of keeping with the general drift of the teaching on the hill. It occurs in a different connection in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-58.htm" title="When you go with your adversary to the magistrate, as you are in the way, give diligence that you may be delivered from him; lest he hale you to the judge, and the judge deliver you to the officer, and the officer cast you into prison.">Luke 12:58</a>, there as a solemn warning to the Jewish people, on its way to judgment, to repent. Meyer pleads that the <span class="ital">logion</span> might be repeated. It might, but only on suitable occasions, and the teaching on the hill does not seem to offer such an occasion. Kuinoel, Bleek, Holtzmann, Weiss and others regard the words as foreign to the connection. Referring to the exposition in Luke, I offer here only a few verbal notes mainly on points in which Matthew differs from Luke.—<span class="greekheb">ἴσθι εὐνοῶν</span>, be in a conciliatory mood, ready to come to terms with your opponent in a legal process (<span class="greekheb">ἀντίδικος</span>). It is a case of debt, and the two, creditor and debtor, are on the way to the court where they must appear together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-18.htm" title="If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and that, when they have chastened him, will not listen to them:">Deuteronomy 21:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-1.htm" title="If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.">Deuteronomy 25:1</a>). Matthew’s expression implies willingness to come to terms amicably on the <span class="ital">creditor’s</span> part, and the debtor is exhorted to meet him half way. Luke’s <span class="greekheb">δὸς ἐργασίαν</span> throws the willingness on the other side, or at least implies that the debtor will need to make an effort to bring the creditor to terms.—<span class="greekheb">παραδῷ</span>, a much milder word than Luke’s <span class="greekheb">κατασύρῃ</span>, which points to rough, rude handling, dragging an unwilling debtor along whither he would rather not go.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπηρέτῃ</span>, the officer of the court whose business it was to collect the debt and generally to carry out the decision of the judge; in Luke <span class="greekheb">πράκτωρ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κοδράντην</span> = <span class="ital">quadrans</span>, less than a farthing.

The question of the relation of the two passages, as regards both language and original connexion, is exceedingly difficult. As to the former, the verbal differences seem to be such as would hardly have been made on purpose, and to be rather due to memory; yet the agreement is too minute to be the result of memory of a Gospel only oral. Perhaps memory of a document best satisfies the conditions. As to the original connexion of the verses, they, especially ver. 26, can hardly have been spoken twice. Most critics suppose that St. Luke gives them in their proper context; but if so, it is curious that two of his words, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, seem to recall our preceding ver. 24. One word might have been a mere coincidence, but hardly two. It is not likely that these words in ver. 24 were derived from <span class="accented">Luke</span>, for this <span class="accented">supposes</span> a double process in St. Matthew's mind, rejecting them from ver. 25 and placing them in ver. 24. It is more natural also to regard the first clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>, "As...  him," as an expansion of the corresponding clause in our ver. 25 rather than this as a compression of that. This apparent reminiscence in Luke of what is given in our vers. 24 and 25a points to the connexion of vers. 24-26 in Matthew being original, and to it having been broken by Luke or by the framer of the source that he used. A further stage in our Lord's warning. A man must not only seek reconciliation with the injured person (ver. 23), and that in preference to fulfilling the holiest service (ver. 24), but he must do so the more because of the danger of postponing reconciliation. It is noteworthy that our Lord in this verse does not define on whose side the cause of the quarrel lies. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Agree with</span>. And that not with a merely formal reconciliation, but reconciliation based on a permanent kindly feeling towards him (<span class="greek">&#x1f34;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>). Professor Margoliouth suggests that this is a confirmation of what he thinks is the original text of Ecclus. 18:20, "Before judgment beg off" ('Inaugural Lect.,' p. 23: 1890). <span class="cmt_word">Thine adversary</span>. Primarily the injured brother (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>), <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Quickly</span>. For such is not the tendency of the human heart. <span class="cmt_word">Whiles</span>. Delay not in making reconciliation while you have opportunity. Thayer compares <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/1-12.htm">Song of Solomon 1:12</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Thou art</span>. On the indicative, cf. Winer, &sect; 41. b, 3. 2, a, note (p. 371, trans. 1870). <span class="cmt_word">In the way with him</span>; Revised Version, with the manuscripts, <span class="accented">with him in the way.</span> The right reading implies that the proximity of the persons may perhaps not last throughout "the way." "The way" is the road to the judge, as explained in -Luke. But being on the road to him is here not presented as a possibility (Luke), but as a certainty. For so, in fact, it is. <span class="cmt_word">Lest...  the adversary</span> (ver. 26, note) <span class="cmt_word">deliver</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> Translating from the language of parable to that of fact, it is only if reconciliation has not been made, if the heart is still unforgiving and quarrelsome, that God the Judge will take notice of the offence. <span class="cmt_word">And the judge...  to the officer</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f50;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x1fc3;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the officer whose duty it was to execute the judge's commands (cf. Lightfoot, 'Hor. Hebr.,' for illustrations). The expression here belongs to the figure; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-41.htm">Matthew 13:41</a> similar duties are predicated of the angels. If the figure was derived from the synagogue, the officer would doubtless be the <span class="accented">chazzan</span>, of which, indeed, <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span> is the technical rendering (cf. Schurer, II. 2. p. 66). <span class="cmt_word">And thou be cast</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>  <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x1fc3;</span>). The future indicative (still dependent on "lest") brings out the reality of the danger (cf. Bishop Lightfoot, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Agree with (&#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Lit., be well-minded toward; inclined to satisfy by paying or compromising.

It furnishes an interesting instance of the expansion of a word from a limited and special meaning into a more general one; and also of the influence of the Gospel in lifting words into higher and purer associations. Formed with the verb &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;, to row, it originally signified a rower, as distinguished from a soldier, in a war-galley. This word for a galley-slave comes at last, in the hands of Luke and Paul, to stand for the noblest of all offices, that of a minister of the Lord Jesus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-2.htm">Luke 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-16.htm">Acts 26:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/4-1.htm">1 Corinthians 4:1</a>). </body></html>
