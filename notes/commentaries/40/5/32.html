The words <span class= "ital">causeth her to commit adultery</span> imply that the “putting away” was legally a divorce <span class= "ital">à vinculo,</span> leaving the wife, and <span class= "ital">à fortiori</span> the husband, at liberty to marry again; for otherwise she could not have incurred the guilt of adultery by a second marriage: but it asserts that in such a case, when divorce was obtained on any other ground than the specific sin which violated the essence of the marriage contract, man’s law (even that of Moses) was at variance with the true eternal law of God.<p><span class= "bld">Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced.</span>—The Greek is less definite, and may be rendered either “a woman who has been put away,” or better, “her when she has been put away.” Those who take the former construction, infer from it the absolute unlawfulness of marriage with a divorced woman under any circumstances whatever; some holding that the husband is under the same restrictions, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>that the <span class= "ital">vinculum matrimonii</span> is absolutely indissoluble; while others teach that in the excepted case, both the husband and the wife gain the right to contract a second marriage. The Romish Church, in theory, takes the former view, the Greek and most Reformed Churches the latter; while some codes, like those of some countries in modern Europe, go back to the looser interpretation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>, and allow the divorce <span class= "ital">à vinculo</span> for many lesser causes than incontinence. Of these contending views, that which is intermediate between the two extremes seems to be most in harmony with the true meaning of our Lord’s words. The words “put away” would necessarily convey to His Jewish hearers the idea of an entire dissolution of the marriage union, leaving both parties free to contract a fresh marriage; and if it were not so, then the case in which He specially permits that dissolution would stand on the same level as the others. The injured husband would still be bound to the wife who had broken the vow which was of the essence of the marriage-contract. But if he was free to marry again, then the guilt of adultery could not possibly attach to her subsequent marriage with another. The context, therefore, requires us to restrict that guilt to the case of a wife divorced for other reasons, such as Jewish casuistry looked on as adequate. This, then, seems the true law of divorce for the Church of Christ as such to recognise. The question as to how far national legislation may permit divorce for other causes, such as cruelty or desertion, seems to stand on a different footing, and must be discussed on different grounds. In proportion as the “hardness of heart” which made the wider license the least of two evils prevails now, it may be not only expedient, but right and necessary, though it implies a standard of morals lower than the law of Christ, to meet it, as it was met of old, by a like reluctant permission.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:27-32 Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>It hath been said ... - That is, by Moses, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1-2</a>. The husband was directed, if he put his wife away, to give her a bill of divorce, that is a certificate of the fact she had been his wife, and that he had dissolved the marriage. There was considerable difference of opinion among the Jews for what causes the husband was permitted to do this. One of their famous schools maintained that it might be done for any cause, however trivial. The other maintained that adultery only could justify it. The truth was, however, that the husband exercised this right at pleasure; that he was judge in the case, and dismissed his wife when and for what cause he chose. And this seems to be agreeable to the law in Deuteronomy. Our Saviour in <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/10-1.htm">Mark 10:1-12</a>, says that this was permitted on account of the hardness of their hearts, but that in the beginning it was not so. God made a single pair, and ordained marriage for life. But Moses found the people so much hardened; so long accustomed to the practice, and so rebellious, that, as a matter of civil appointment, he thought it best not to attempt any change. Our Saviour brought marriage back to its original intention, and declared that whosoever put away his wife henceforward, except for one offence, should be guilty of adultery. This is now the law of God. This was the original institution. This is the only law that is productive of peace and good morals, and that secures the respect due to a wife, and the good of children. Nor has any man or set of men - any legislature or any court, civil or ecclesiastical - a right to interfere, and declare that divorces may be granted for any other cause. They, therefore, whoever they may be, who are divorced for any cause except the single one of adultery, if they marry again, are, according to the Scriptures, living in adultery. No earthly laws can trample down the laws of God, or make that right which he has solemnly pronounced wrong. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>32.

But see on [1226]Mt 19:4-9. Whether the innocent party, after a just divorce, may lawfully marry again, is not treated of here. The Church of Rome says, No; but the Greek and Protestant Churches allow it.<p>Same Subject Illustrated from the Third Commandment (Mt 5:33-37).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 31,32. The law to which our Saviour refers here, or rather the indulgence and toleration, (for none was obliged to put away their wives in case of uncleanness), is that <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm" title="When a man has taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favor in his eyes, because he has found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill of divorce, and give it in her hand, and send her out of his house.">Deu 24:1</a></span>, where we have it in these words: <span class="ital">When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and</span> <span class="ital">it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he</span> <span class="ital">hath found some uncleanness in her; then let him write her a bill</span> <span class="ital">of divorcement, and give it her in her hand, and send her out of</span> <span class="ital">his house.</span> The Pharisees had extended this toleration which God gave husbands amongst the Jews to other cases, besides that of uncleanness or adultery; so as they put away their wives upon every slight occasion, interpreting those words, <span class="ital">that she find no favour</span> <span class="ital">in his eyes, </span> separately from the following words, <span class="ital">because he</span> <span class="ital">hath found some uncleanness in her, </span> and gave a liberty for men upon any dislike of their wives to put them away, provided that they first gave them a bill of divorcement; and that in these cases it was lawful for the parties, thus separated from each other, to marry to whom either of them pleased; and this is expressed in terms in their form of those writings of divorcement, in Josephus and other writers. This indeed is a case properly relating to the judicial law; but all the judicial laws are either appendices to the moral or to the ceremonial law. This particular indulgence was an appendix to the moral law, by the seventh commandment, to which our Saviour is now speaking, and giving the true sense of it. He here opposeth the Pharisees in two points. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Asserting that all divorces are unlawful except in case of adultery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Asserting that whosoever married her that was put away committed adultery. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It hath been a great question, not so much amongst divines as amongst lawyers, whether it be not lawful in any case to put away a wife, unless for adultery? The canonists have found out many cases in which they affirm it lawful. And the Council of Trent (from whom we may learn the sense of the popish divines) anathematize those who deny the church a power of determining other causes of divorce. But their blasphemous curse falleth upon him, who is above them, God over all blessed for ever, who in this text hath determined that point. Nor indeed did Moses give a toleration in any other cases. There may indeed be a parting between man and wife upon other accounts, either wholly or in part: in case one of them will part from the other, which the apostle determines, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-11.htm" title="But and if she depart, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife.">1 Corinthians 7:11</a>,15</span>; in which case the person departing is only guilty if he or she marry again. In case of an error, through ignorance or inadvertency, upon the marriage, that it appeareth that the persons married were such as by the law of nature and of God ought not to have married, &c. But if we take divorce for the voluntary act of the husband putting away of his wife, it is unlawful in any case but that of adultery, which dissolves the marriage knot and covenant. A second question is also here determined by our Saviour, viz. that it is unlawful for her, that is justly put away, to marry to any other, or for any other to marry her wittingly. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But I say unto you; that whosoever shall put away his wife,.... Christ does not infringe, or revoke the original grant, or permission of divorce; only frees it from the false interpretations, and ill use, the Pharisees made of it; and restores the ancient sense of it, in which only it was to be understood: for a divorce was allowable in no case, <p>saving for the cause of fornication; which must not be taken strictly for what is called fornication, but as including adultery, incest, or any unlawful copulation; and is opposed to the sense and practices of the Pharisees, who were on the side of Hillell: who admitted of divorce, upon the most foolish and frivolous pretences whatever; when Shammai and his followers insisted on it, that a man ought only to put away his wife for uncleanness; in which they agreed with Christ. For so it is written (i), <p>"The house of Shammai say, a man may not put away his wife, unless he finds some uncleanness in her, according to  <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> The house of Hillell say, if she should spoil his food, (that is, as Jarchi and Bartenora explain it, burns it either at the fire, or with salt, i.e. over roasts or over salts it,) who appeal also to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a>. R. Akiba says, if he finds another more beautiful than her, as it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-1.htm">Deuteronomy 24:1</a> "and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes."'' <p>The commentators (k) on this passage say that the determination of the matter is, according to the school of Millell; so that, according to them, a woman might be put away for a very trivial thing: some difference is made by some of the Jewish doctors, between a first and second wife; the first wife, they say (l), might not be put away, but for adultery; but the second might be put away, if her husband hated her; or she was of ill behaviour, and impudent, and not modest, as the daughters of Israel. Now our Lord says, without any exception, that a man ought not to put away his wife, whether first or second, for any other reason than uncleanness; and that whoever does, upon any other account, <p>causeth her to commit adultery; that is, as much as in him lies: should she commit it, he is the cause of it, by exposing her, through a rejection of her, to the sinful embraces of others; and, indeed, should she marry another man, whilst he is alive, which her divorce allows her to do, she must be guilty of adultery; since she is his proper wife, the bond of marriage not being dissolved by such a divorce: and <p>whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, committeth adultery; because the divorced woman he marries, and takes to his bed; is legally the wife of another man; and it may be added, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm">Matthew 19:9</a> that her husband, who has put her away, upon any other account than fornication, should he marry another woman, would be guilty of the same crime. <p>(i) Misn.

Weiss in <span class="ital">d. Zeitschr. f. christl. Wissensch</span>. 1856, p, 261. But as the exception which Jesus here makes cannot become devoid of meaning by means of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm" title="And the man that commits adultery with another man's wife, even he that commits adultery with his neighbor's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.">Leviticus 20:10</a> (in answer to Schegg, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-3.htm" title="And the scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the middle,">John 8:3</a> ff.), so also it is not to be annulled on critical grounds, which in view of the witnesses is impossible (in answer to Keim here and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.">Matthew 19:9</a>).

That by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΠΟΛΕΛΥΜΈΝΗΝ</span></span></span>, a woman who is dismissed <span class="ital">illegally</span>, consequently <span class="ital">not on account of adultery</span>, is intended, was understood as a matter of course, according to the first half of the verse.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[412] It means in general every kind of <span class="ital">whoredom</span> (Dem. 403. 26, 433. 25, 612. 5). Where it specially refers to <span class="ital">adultery</span> (<span class="greekheb">μοιχεία</span>) this is clear from the context, as here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-9.htm" title="And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, commits adultery: and whoever marries her which is put away does commit adultery.">Matthew 19:9</a>. Thus, for example, it means also the idolatry of the people of God, because that is adultery against Jehovah, <span class="greekheb">πορνεία</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm" title="The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD said to Hosea, Go, take to you a wife of prostitutions and children of prostitutions: for the land has committed great prostitution, departing from the LORD.">Hosea 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-15.htm" title="But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.">Ezekiel 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/23-43.htm" title="Then said I to her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit prostitutions with her, and she with them?">Ezekiel 23:43</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[413] How can one seriously suppose that Jesus could have laid down so slippery an exception! indelicate, uncertain, unwise, a welcome opening to all kinds of severity and chicanery, especially considering the jealousy of the Jews. And the exception would have to hold good also in the case of marriages with widows!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[414] But by the circumstance that Jesus here expressly quotes as an exception this actual ground of separation, which was understood as a matter of course, <span class="ital">He excludes every other</span> (comp. especially Calovius); and it is incorrect to say that, while He grants one actual ground of separation, He still allows several others (Grotius, de Wette, Bleek, and others; comp. also Werner in <span class="ital">d. Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1858, p. 702 ff.), which is quite opposed to the point of view of moral <span class="ital">strictness</span>, from which He excepts only <span class="ital">that</span> case in which the actual dissolution of the marriage in its innermost nature is directly given.—That Christ bases His answer on the question of divorce purely upon the <span class="ital">nature</span> of the divine ordinance of marriage as it was already given at the creation (<span class="ital">una caro</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-5.htm" title="For whether is easier, to say, Your sins be forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?">Matthew 9:5</a>), not upon its <span class="ital">object</span>, is of decisive importance for the legislation in question, where we have also to observe that the altered <span class="ital">form</span> of divorce (the <span class="ital">judicial</span>) can make no change in the <span class="ital">principles</span> laid down by Jesus. Otherwise the legislation relating to marriage is driven on and on, by way of supposed consistency, to the laxity of the Prussian law and that of other lands (comp. the concessions of Bleek). Moreover, as regards malicious desertion, the declarations of Christ admit of application only so far as that desertion <span class="ital">quoad formam</span>, consequently according to its essential nature, is fully equivalent to adultery, which, however, must always be a question in each individual case.

See on the passage.—Of <span class="ital">that</span> case of separation, where the <span class="ital">man</span> commits adultery, Christ does not speak, because the law, which does not know of any dismissal of the man on the part of the woman, presented no occasion to it. But the <span class="ital">application</span> of the principle in the case of adultery on the part of the woman to that of the man as a ground of divorce rightly follows in accordance with the moral spirit of Jesus; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm" title="And if a woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she commits adultery.">Mark 10:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-28.htm" title="There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for you are all one in Christ Jesus.">Galatians 3:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-11.htm" title="Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the man, in the Lord.">1 Corinthians 11:11</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. <span class="ital">causeth her to commit adultery</span>] By adopting a slightly different reading in the original with Lachmann, Tischendorf, and Tregelles, the idea of wilful sin on the woman’s part is removed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that is divorced</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">when she hath been divorced</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-32.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced commits adultery.">Matthew 5:32</a>. <span class="greekheb">Λόγου</span>, <span class="ital">for the cause</span>) The Hebrew <span class="greekheb">דָּבָר </span>corresponds to the Greek <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> in the sense of a cause, why anything may be rightly done.[212]—<span class="greekheb">ποιεῖ αὐτὴν μοιχᾶσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">makes her to commit adultery</span>) sc. by other nuptials into which the divorce permits her to enter.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπολελυμένην</span>, <span class="ital">one that has been divorced</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[212] These words, <span class="greekheb">παρεκτὸς λόγου πορνείας</span>, apply also to the following clause <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> ὁ͂<span class="greekheb">ς εἄν ἀπολελ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γαμ</span>, and are to be supplied in it.—<span class="ital">Vers.

For examples, see Lightfoot ('Hor. Hebr.'). Our Lord upholds the school of Shammai. It is said that shameful laxity in divorce still exists among Oriental Jews. <span class="cmt_word">Fornication</span>. The reference is to sin after marriage. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-20.htm">Deuteronomy 22:20, 21</a>, where the husband's action is not thought of as <span class="accented">divorce.</span> The more general word (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>) is used, because it lays more stress on the physical character of the sin than <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> would have laid. <span class="cmt_word">Causeth her to commit adultery</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">maketh her an adulteress</span>, since the right reading, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x1fc6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, connotes being sinned against rather than sinning (Received Text, <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c7;&#x1fb6;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>).

(On the importance of the 'Western' group in cases of omission, <span class="accented">vide</span> Westcott and Hort, 2. &sect;&sect; 240-242; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>, note.) The clause closely resembles <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a>b. <span class="cmt_word">Her that is divorced</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> under these wrong conditions, as Revised Version, <span class="accented">her when put away.</span> even though <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3bd;</span> is not expressed. This interpretation, notwithstanding Weiss's stigma of it as "ganz willkurlich," is surely only a plain deduction from the preceding clause. The fact that no such limitation is to be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-18.htm">Luke 16:18</a> must not prejudice our judgment here. </body></html>
