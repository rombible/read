Here, again, the reference is to the letter of the Law as taught by the Rabbis, who did not go beyond it to its wider spirit. To them the Third Commandment was simply a prohibition of perjury, as the Sixth was of murder, or the Seventh of adultery. They did not see that the holy name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a>) might be profaned in other ways, even when it was not uttered; and they expressly or tacitly allowed (See Philo, <span class= "ital">De Special. Legg.</span>) many forms of oath in which it was not named, as with the view of guarding it from desecration. Lastly, out of the many forms thus sanctioned (as here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16-22</a>) they selected some as binding, and others as not binding, and thus by a casuistry at once subtle, irrational, and dishonest, tampered with men’s sense of truthfulness.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/matthew/5.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Matthew<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">‘SWEAR NOT AT ALL’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:...">Matthew 5:33-37</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> In His treatment of the sixth and seventh commandments, Jesus deepened them by bringing the inner man of feeling and desire under their control. In His treatment of the old commandments as to oaths, He expands them by extending the prohibitions from one kind of oath to all kinds. The movement in the former case is downwards and inwards; in the latter it is outwards, the compass sweeping a wider circle. Perjury, a false oath, was all that had been forbidden. He forbids all. We may note that the forms of colloquial swearing, which our Lord specifies, are not to be taken as an exhaustive enumeration of what is forbidden. They are in the nature of a parenthesis, and the sentence runs on continuously without them-’Swear not at all . . . but let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay.’ The reason appended is equally universal, for it suggests the deep thought that ‘whatsoever is more than these’ that is to say, any form of speech that seeks to strengthen a simple, grave asseveration by such oaths as He has just quoted, ‘cometh of evil’ inasmuch as it springs from, and reveals, the melancholy fact that his bare word is not felt binding by a man, and is not accepted as conclusive by others. If lies were not so common, oaths would be needless. And oaths increase the evil from which they come, by confirming the notion that there is no sin in a lie unless it is sworn to.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The oaths specified are all colloquial, which were and are continually and offensively mingled with common speech in the East. Nowhere are there such habitual liars, and nowhere are there so many oaths. Every traveller there knows that, and sees how true is Christ’s filiation of the custom of swearing from the custom of falsehood. But these poisonous weeds of speech not only tended to degrade plain veracity in the popular mind, but were themselves parents of immoral evasions, for it was the teaching of some Rabbis, at all events, that an oath ‘by heaven’ or ‘by earth’ or ‘by Jerusalem’ or ‘by my head’ did not bind. That further relaxation of the obligation of truthfulness was grounded on the words quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a>, for, said the immoral quibblers, ‘it is “thine oaths to the Lord” that thou “shalt perform,” and for these others you may do as you like’ Therefore our Lord insists that every oath, even these mutilated, colloquial ones which avoid His name, is in essence an appeal to God, and has no sense unless it is. To swear such a truncated oath, then, has the still further condemnation that it is certainly an irreverence, and probably a quibble, and meant to be broken. It must be fully admitted that there is little in common between such pieces of senseless profanity as these oaths, or the modern equivalents which pollute so many lips to-day, and the oath administered in a court of justice, and it may further be allowed weight that Jesus does not specifically prohibit the oath ‘by the Lord,’ but it is difficult to see how the principles on which He condemns are to be kept from touching even judicial oaths. For they, too, are administered on the ground of the false idea that they add to the obligation of veracity, and give a guarantee of truthfulness which a simple affirmation does not give. Nor can any one, who knows the perfunctory formality and indifference with which such oaths are administered and taken, and what a farce ‘kissing the book’ has become, doubt that even judicial oaths tend to weaken the popular conception of the sin of a lie and the reliance to be placed upon the simple ‘Yea, yea; Nay, nay.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:...">Matthew 5:33-37</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">was said to the ancients, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, </span>&c. — See the margin. The Jewish doctors affirmed, that oaths were obligatory according to the nature of the things by which a man swears: <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-10.htm" title="Neither be you called masters: for one is your Master, even Christ.">Matthew 23:10</a>. Hence they allowed the use of such oaths in common conversation as they said were not obligatory; pretending that there was no harm in them, because the law, which forbade them to forswear themselves, and enjoined them to perform their vows, meant such solemn oaths only as were of a binding nature. It is this detestable morality which Jesus condemns in the following words. <span class="ital">But I say unto you, Swear not at all </span>— In your common discourse one with another, but barely <span class="ital">affirm </span>or <span class="ital">deny. </span>Swear not by any thing, on the supposition that the oath will not bind you. “For all oaths whatever, those by the lowest of the creatures not excepted, are obligatory;” because, if they “have any meaning at all, they are an appeal to the great Creator; consequently they are oaths by him, implying a solemn invocation of his wrath on such of the creatures sworn by as are capable of God’s wrath; and for the other, the oath implies a solemn imprecation, in case of your swearing falsely, that you may be for ever deprived of all the comfort or advantage you have in, or hope from those creatures. <span class="ital">Swear not, </span>therefore, <span class="ital">neither by heaven, </span>&c. — By comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!">Matthew 23:16</a>, it appears that our Lord is here giving a catalogue of oaths, which, in the opinion of the doctors, were not obligatory. His meaning therefore is, Swear not at all, unless you have a mind to perform; because every oath being really obligatory, he who, from an opinion that some are not, swears voluntarily by heaven, or by the earth, or by Jerusalem, or by his own head, is without all doubt guilty of perjury. Much more is he guilty, who, when called thereto by lawful authority, swears with an intention to falsify. But by no means does Jesus condemn swearing truly before a magistrate, or upon grave and solemn occasions, because that would have been to prohibit both the best method of ending controversies, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm" title="For men truly swear by the greater: and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all strife.">Hebrews 6:16</a>; and a high act of religious worship, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-3.htm" title="Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as the LORD God of your fathers has promised you, in the land that flows with milk and honey.">Deuteronomy 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; an oath being not only a solemn appeal to the Divine Omniscience, from which nothing can be hid, but a direct acknowledgment of God, as the great patron and protector of right, and the avenger of falsehood.” <span class="ital">But let your communication be yea, yea </span>— Avoid the use of all such oaths, as of those in which the name of God is directly expressed, and maintain such sincerity and truth in all your words as will merit the belief of your acquaintance; so that, in common conversation, to gain yourselves credit, you need do no more than barely assert or deny any matter, without invoking the name of God at all. <span class="ital">For whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εκ του πονηρου</span>, <span class="ital">Of the evil one: </span>in common discourse, whatever is more than affirmation or negation, ariseth from the temptation of the devil, who tempts men to curse and to swear, that he may lessen in them, and in all who hear them, a due reverence of the Divine Majesty, and by this means lead them, at length, to perjury, even in the most solemn instances; considerations which show the evil nature of this sin in the strongest light. The Apostle James expresses this sentiment thus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a>, <span class="ital">Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay. </span>The first yea and nay, therefore, signify the promise or assertion; the second the fulfilment. Accordingly we find the word <span class="ital">yea </span>used as a promise, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-7.htm" title="Behold, he comes with clouds; and every eye shall see him, and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth shall wail because of him.

But all oaths taken without necessity, or in common conversation, must be sinful, as well as all those expressions which are appeals to God, though persons think thereby to evade the guilt of swearing. The worse men are, the less they are bound by oaths; the better they are, the less there is need for them. Our Lord does not enjoin the precise terms wherein we are to affirm or deny, but such a constant regard to truth as would render oaths unnecessary.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thou shalt not forswear thyself - Christ here proceeds to correct another false interpretation of the law. The law respecting oaths is found in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-23.htm">Deuteronomy 23:23</a>. By those laws people were forbid to perjure themselves, or to forswear, that is, swear falsely.<p>Perform unto the Lord - Perform literally, really, and religiously what is promised in an oath.<p>Thine oaths - An oath is a solemn affirmation or declaration, made with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed, and imprecating his vengeance, and renouncing his favor if what is affirmed is false. A false oath is called perjury, or, as in this place, forswearing.<p>It appears, however, from this passage, as well as from the ancient writings of the Jewish rabbins, that while the Jews professedly adhered to the law, they had introduced a number of oaths in common conversation, and oaths which they by no means considered to be binding. For example, they would swear by the temple, by the head, by heaven, by the earth. So long as they kept from swearing by the name Yahweh, and so long as they observed the oaths publicly taken, they seemed to consider all others as allowable, and allowedly broken. This is the abuse which Christ wished to correct. "It was the practice of swearing in common conversation, and especially swearing by created things." To do this, he said that they were mistaken in their views of the sacredness of such oaths. They were very closely connected with God; and to trifle with them was a species of trifling with God. Heaven is his throne; the earth his footstool; Jerusalem his special abode; the head was made by him, and was so much under his control that we could not make one hair white or black. To swear by these things, therefore, was to treat irreverently objects created by God, and could not be without guilt. It is remarkable that the sin here condemned by the Saviour prevails still in Palestine in the same form and manner referred to here. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. ii. p. 284) says, "The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, and by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long."<p>Our Saviour here evidently had no reference to judicial oaths, or oaths taken in a court of justice. It was merely the foolish and wicked habit of swearing in private conversation; of swearing on every occasion and by everything that he condemned. This he does condemn in a most unqualified manner. He himself, however, did not refuse to take an oath in a court of law, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/26-63.htm">Matthew 26:63-64</a>. So Paul often called God to witness his sincerity, which is all that is meant by an oath. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm">Galatians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-16.htm">Hebrews 6:16</a>. Oaths were, moreover, prescribed in the law of Moses, and Christ did not come to repeal those laws. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-11.htm">Exodus 22:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm">Leviticus 5:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-12.htm">Deuteronomy 29:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-14.htm">Deuteronomy 29:14</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>33. Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself&#8212;These are not the precise words of Ex 20:7; but they express all that it was currently understood to condemn, namely, false swearing (Le 19:12, &c.). This is plain from what follows.<p>But I say unto you, Swear not at all&#8212;That this was meant to condemn swearing of every kind and on every occasion&#8212;as the Society of Friends and some other ultra-moralists allege&#8212;is not for a moment to be thought. For even Jehovah is said once and again to have sworn by Himself; and our Lord certainly answered upon oath to a question put to Him by the high priest; and the apostle several times, and in the most solemn language, takes God to witness that he spoke and wrote the truth; and it is inconceivable that our Lord should here have quoted the precept about not forswearing ourselves, but performing to the Lord our oaths, only to give a precept of His own directly in the teeth of it. Evidently, it is swearing in common intercourse and on frivolous occasions that is here meant. Frivolous oaths were indeed severely condemned in the teaching of the times. But so narrow was the circle of them that a man might swear, says Lightfoot, a hundred thousand times and yet not be guilty of vain swearing. Hardly anything was regarded as an oath if only the name of God were not in it; just as among ourselves, as Trench well remarks, a certain lingering reverence for the name of God leads to cutting off portions of His name, or uttering sounds nearly resembling it, or substituting the name of some heathen deity, in profane exclamations or asseverations. Against all this our Lord now speaks decisively; teaching His audience that every oath carries an appeal to God, whether named or not.<p>neither by heaven; for it is God's throne&#8212;(quoting Isa 66:1);<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This was said <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm" title="You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain; for the LORD will not hold him guiltless that takes his name in vain.">Exodus 20:7</a></span>, and more plainly <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm" title="And you shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shall you profane the name of your God: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:12</a></span>; the substance was there said, though the words be not <span class="ital">verbatim</span> recited. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Again, ye have heard that it hath been said,....
