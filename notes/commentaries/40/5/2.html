The substance of this discourse is recorded also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6.htm">Luke 6</a>. It is commonly called the "Sermon on the Mount." It is not improbable that it was repeated, in substance, on different occasions, and to different people. At those times parts of it may have been omitted, and Luke may have recorded it as it was pronounced on one of those occasions. See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/6-17.htm">Luke 6:17-20</a>.<p>Went up into a mountain - This mountain, or hill, was somewhere in the vicinity of Capernaum, but where precisely is not mentioned. He ascended the hill, doubtless, because it was more convenient to address the multitude from an eminence than if he were on the same level with them. A hill or mountain is still shown a short distance to the northwest of the ancient site of Capernaum, which tradition reports to have been the place where this sermon was delivered, and which is called on the maps the Mount of Beatitudes. The hill commonly believed to be that on which the sermon was delivered is on the road from Nazareth to Tiberias, not far from the latter place. The hill is known by the name of Kuran Huttin, the Horns of Huttin. Of this hill Professor Hackett (Illustrations of Scripture, pp. 323, 324) says: "Though a noontide heat was beating down upon us with scorching power, I could not resist the temptation to turn aside and examine a place for which such a claim has been set up, though I cannot say that I have any great confidence in it. The hill referred to is rocky, and rises steeply to a moderate height above the plain. It has two summits, with a slight depression between them, and it is from these projecting points, or horns, that it receives the name given to it. From the top the observer has a full view of the Sea of Tiberias. The most pleasing feature of the landscape is that presented by the diversified appearance of the fields. The different plots of ground exhibit various colors, according to the state. of cultivation: some of them are red, where the land has been newly plowed up, the natural appearance of the soil; others yellow or white, where the harvest is beginning to ripen, or is already ripe; and others green, being covered with grass or springing grain. As they are contiguous to each other, or intermixed, these particolored plots present at some distance an appearance of joyful chequered work, which is really beautiful.<p>"In rhetorical descriptions of the delivery of the Sermon on the Mount, we often hear the people represented as looking up to the speaker from the sides of the hill, or listening to him from the plain. This would not be possible with reference to the present locality; for it is too precipitous and too elevated to allow of such a position. The Saviour could have sat there, however, in the midst of his hearers, for it affords a platform amply large enough for the accommodation of the hundreds who may have been present on that occasion."<p>And when he was set - This was the common mode of teaching among the Jews, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-20.htm">Luke 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-3.htm">Luke 5:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-2.htm">John 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-14.htm">Acts 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm">Acts 16:13</a>.<p>His disciples came unto him - The word "disciples" means "learners," those who are taught.

This phrase belongs to the distinctly descriptive style of narrative, and denotes of itself nothing else than the opening of the mouth to speak, where the connection alone indicates whether in this descriptive element the emphasis of solemnity, of boldness, or the like is contained or not.

Here, where the first extensive discourse of Jesus, which forms the great programme for the membership of His kingdom, follows, the solemn character of the moment, “He opened His mouth,” is not to be mistaken; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>.

The Evangelists have transcribed at full length two discourses of our Lord, as models of all the rest; the one delivered publicly at the commencement of His ministry, that namely which we are now considering; the other privately at its conclusion, recorded in John 13-16. Our Lord’s object in the present discourse is to teach true righteousness (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-1.htm" title="Who is this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, traveling in the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness, mighty to save.">Isaiah 63:1</a>): and He also declares at the same time, that He came to establish the Law and the Prophets, and exposes the spurious character of the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees. In the exordium, there is firstly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-3.htm" title="Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven....">Matthew 5:3-4</a>, a sweet invitation to the fellowship of true righteousness, and therein of blessedness; secondly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-13.htm" title="You are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his flavor, with which shall it be salted? it is thereafter good for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot of men....">Matthew 5:13-14</a>, to the communication of it to others. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.">Matthew 5:17</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm" title="Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.">Matthew 7:12</a>, there is a treatise, the end of which corresponds with the beginning, even to a word. The conclusion of this discourse, firstly, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-13.htm" title="Enter you in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leads to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat:...">Matthew 7:13-14</a>, points out the gate of righteousness; secondly, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-15.htm" title="Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves....">Matthew 7:15-16</a>, warns against false prophets, who go themselves, and lead others, into all kinds of error;[169] and thirdly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:...">Matthew 7:24-25</a>, exhorts us to fulfil these precepts of righteousnesss.

That which follows is represented, not as a proclamation, but as teaching, given to those who in some measure desired to follow and serve him. Some progress already made by the listeners, if only in a relation of respect and reverence, is implied in "teaching." The discourse was therefore spoken, not simply to the multitudes, a chance audience, but with primary and special reference to those who had already made some advance in relation to him. The multitudes, however, were standing by, and were amazed at the unique character of his teaching (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-28.htm">Matthew 7:28, 29</a>; cf. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-20.htm">Luke 6:20</a> with Luke 7:1). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Taught (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The imperfect signifies began to teach. </body></html>
