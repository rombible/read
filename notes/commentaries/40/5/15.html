The candles of the seven-branched candlestick of the Temple were undoubtedly lamps supplied with oil, and so probably were the “candles” of household use. The word is not the same, however, as that used for the “lamps” of the Wise and Foolish Virgins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-1.htm" title="Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.">Matthew 25:1</a>), and was applied apparently to the cheaper vessels of the poor rather than to those of the wealthy. Wiclif translates it “lantern.”<p>The image was drawn from objects familiar to all the hearers, and the presence of the article in the Greek, “under <span class= "ital">the</span> bushel,” “on <span class= "ital">the</span> candlestick or lamp-stand,” implies the familiarity. Each cottage had one such article of furniture. The “bushel” was a Latin measure, nearly the same as the English peck. It adds to the interest of the illustration to remember that as they were commonly of wood, such articles as these must often have been turned out from the carpenter’s shop at Nazareth for the use of its neighbours. It should also be remembered that the self-same word had been applied a short time before by our Lord to the Baptist (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm" title="He was a burning and a shining light: and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light.">John 5:35</a>). His disciples were in this way to continue the Baptist’s work.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:13-16 Ye are the salt of the earth. Mankind, lying in ignorance and wickedness, were as a vast heap, ready to putrify; but Christ sent forth his disciples, by their lives and doctrines to season it with knowledge and grace. If they are not such as they should be, they are as salt that has lost its savour. If a man can take up the profession of Christ, and yet remain graceless, no other doctrine, no other means, can make him profitable. Our light must shine, by doing such good works as men may see. What is between God and our souls, must be kept to ourselves; but that which is of itself open to the sight of men, we must study to make suitable to our profession, and praiseworthy. We must aim at the glory of God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Neither do men light a candle ... - The word rendered "candle" means any portable light, as a lamp, candle, lantern.

Jesus proceeded here to show them that the very reason why they were enlightened was that others might also see the light, and be benefited by it. When people light a candle, they do not conceal the light, but place it where it may be of use. So it is with religion. It is given that we may benefit others. It is not to be concealed, but suffered to show itself, and to shed light on a surrounding wicked world.<p>A bushel - Greek, a measure containing nearly a peck. It denotes anything, here, that might conceal the light. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

It is said of John, (by our Saviour), <span class="ital">he was a burning and shining</span> <span class="ital">light:</span> so is every true minister of the gospel, yea, and every true Christian; not only a burning light, burning with love to God, and zeal for God, and love to and zeal for the souls of others; but also a shining light, communicating his light to others, both by instruction and a holy conversation. Others’ pretended candles were never of God’s lighting. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Neither do men light a candle,.... Which may be read impersonally, "a candle is not lighted": and by it may be meant the Gospel, and gifts qualifying men to preach it; which, like a candle, was lighted in the evening of the Jewish dispensation, though not confined to the land of Judea; but has shone throughout the world, being as a candle to be removed, and has been removed from place to place: wherever it is set, it gives light, more or less, and dispels darkness; it is useful both to work by and walk with; it does not always burn alike clearly, it needs looking after; it has its thieves, as candles sometimes have; and will give the greatest light towards the close of the world, as they usually do, when ready to go out. Now when a candle is lighted by men, they do not <p>put it under a bushel, or anything which may hide and cover it, and so hinder its light and usefulness. The Greek word  rendered a "bushel", answers to the Hebrew  "seah", which is the very word used in Munster's Hebrew Gospel; and this was a dry measure that held about a gallon and a half; and accordingly is rendered here by the Syriac  The design of the expression is, that Christ has lighted the candle of the everlasting Gospel, and given gifts to men for the ministration of it, not to be concealed and neglected, or to be used as the servant did his lord's money, wrap it up in a napkin, and hide it in the earth. Ministers are not, through slothfulness, to neglect the gift that is in them; nor, through fear, to hide their talents, or keep back any part of the Gospel, or cover anything out of sight, which may be profitable to souls: "but" men, when they light a candle, put it <p>on a candlestick, and it giveth light to all that are in the house; as on the candlestick in the temple, a type of the church; where Christ has set the light of the Gospel, where it is held forth particularly by the ministers of the word, to illuminate the whole house and family of God; by the light of which poor sinners, the lost pieces of silver, are looked up; straggling souls are brought home; hypocrites and formalists are detected; and saints are enlightened, directed, and comforted. Much such a proverbial saying is used by the Jews (r): <p>"do not leave a vessel of balsam in a dunghill, but move it from its place, that its smell may spread, and men may receive profit from it.'' <p>(r) Vid.

Sac.</span>). The figure is taken from lowly cottage life. There was a projecting stone in the wall on which the lamp was set. The house consisted of a single room, so that the tiny light sufficed for all. It might now and then be placed under the <span class="ital">modius</span>, an earthenware grain measure, or under the bed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm" title="And he said to them, Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel, or under a bed? and not to be set on a candlestick?">Mark 4:21</a>), high to keep clear of serpents, therefore without danger of setting it on fire (Koetsveld, <span class="ital">De Gelijkenissen</span>, p. 305). But that would be the exception, not the rule—done occasionally for special reasons, perhaps during the hours of sleep. Schanz says the lamp burned all night, and that when they wanted darkness they put it on the floor and covered it with the “bushel”. Tholuck also thinks people might cover the light when they wished to keep it burning, when they had occasion to leave the room for a time. Weiss, on the other hand, thinks it would be put under a cover only when they wished to put it out (Matt.-Evan., p. 144). But was it ever put out? Not so, according to Benzinger (Heb. Arch., p. 124).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">a bushel</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">the</span> bushel, i. e. the common measure found in every Jewish house.

All four passages have too much verbal similarity to admit of any of them being absolutely independent. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> has the greatest number of peculiarities. The two passages in Luke agree very closely with each other, but of the two, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a> most resembles Matthew. The close agreement here with the context seems to point to this being an original position of the utterance. Of the other two contexts <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-33.htm">Luke 11:33</a>, if we must choose, seems the more natural. Godet, however, says, "This passage has been placed in the sermon on the mount, like so many others, rather because of the association of ideas than from historical reminiscence" (similarly Weiss). <span class="accented">Neither.</span> The inherent position, so to speak, of Christ's disciples, as of a city set on a mountain, is not accidental. It answers to the purpose of their being disciples, as is explained further by the illustration of a lamp. <span class="accented">A candle</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">a lamp</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>); <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the flat, saucer-like Eastern lamp, in which sometimes the wick merely floats on the oil <span class="cmt_word">A bushel...  a candlestick</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">the bushel</span>... <span class="accented">the stand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). Probably rightly, for if the article had been generic (cf. Mishna, 'Sabb.,' 4:2, "One may fill a pitcher [literally, 'the pitcher,' <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;&#x5ea;&#x20;&#x5d4;&#x5e7;&#x5d9;&#x5ea;&#x5d5;&#x5df;</span>]. and put it under, a [literally, 'the'] pillow, or under a [literally, the] bolster [on the sabbath in order to take the chill off it]," W.H. Lowe, 'Fragment of Pesachim,' 1879, p. 95; cf. also Driver on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>) it would have been found also before <span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>. "The description applies to the common houses of the people. In each there was one principal room, in which they ate and slept; the lampstand, with its single light, the flour-bin, and the bed, with a few seats, were all its furniture" (Cook, in 'Speaker's Commentary,' on <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-21.htm">Mark 4:21</a> ). <span class="accented">A bushel</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>). This is probably equivalent to the <span class="accented">seah</span> (so Peshito), which was "the ordinary measure for domestic purposes," and, as slated in the margins of the Authorized and the Revised Versions on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-33.htm">Matthew 13:33</a>, held "nearly a peck and a half" dry measure. The Latin <span class="accented">modius</span>, here used to render <span class="accented">scab</span>, itself held nearly a peck. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-16.htm">Luke 8:16</a> the vaguer term <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fe6;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> is used. "Bushel" is retained in the Revised Version probably because it can be used of the vessel apart from all thought of measure; cf. "The Sense represents the Sun no bigger than a Bushel" (Hale [1677], in Murray's 'Oxford Dictionary'). <span class="accented">But on a candlestick</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">but on the stand</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>); Vulgate, from Old Latin, <span class="accented">Neque accendunt lucernam et possunt cam sub modio sed super candelabrum. Candelabrum</span> (cf. "chandelier") meant a stand for either candles or lamps; hence Wickliffe, translating from the Vulgate, could say, "Ne me[n] teen-dith not a lanterne & puttith it vndir a buyschel: but on a candilstik." We still use "candlestick" in the rarer sense when we speak of the seven-branched "candlestick" of the tabernacle, which was lighted by lamps, not candies (cf. Humphry, on Revised Version, <span class="accented">in loc.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>It giveth Light</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">it shineth</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>). The Rheims alone of the older English versions renders" shine," thus showing that the same Greek word is used as in the next verse. The Vulgate (followed by Wickliffe and Rheims) renders it in the subjunctive, <span class="accented">ut lucent</span>, possibly originally a copyist's error from the <span class="accented">luceat</span> of ver. 16. If so, it was apparently made before the time of Tertullian ('De Prescript.,' &sect; 26). The thought is stir primarily of the light itself being  necessarily seen rather than of its benefiting others (<span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-36.htm">Luke 11:36</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-9.htm">John 1:9</a>). To all. For in a room none can help noticing it, even though the lamp and the light itself be but small. The negative of this verse is given in Pseudo-Cyprian, 'De Aleat.,' 3, "Monet dominus et dicit: nolite contris tare Spiritum Sanctum, qui in vobis est, et <span class="accented">nolite exstinguere lumen</span>, <span class="accented">quod in vobis efful sit"</span> (<span class="accented">vide</span> Resch, 'Agrapha,' pp. 111, 215). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>A bushel (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., rightly, "the bushel;" since the definite article is designed to indicate a familiar object - the grain-measure which is found in every house.<p>A candlestick (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., the stand. Also a part of the furniture of every house, and commonly but one in the house: hence the article.
