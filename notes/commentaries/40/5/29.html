The difficulty of finding an equivalent is shown by the variations in the successive English versions: “offend,” in Tyndal’s; “hinder thee,” in Cranmer’s; “cause thee to offend,” in the Geneva; “scandalise,” in the Rhemish; “offend,” again in the Authorised version. Of these the Geneva is, beyond doubt, the best.<p><span class= "bld">Pluck it out.</span>—The bold severity of the phrase excludes a literal interpretation. The seat of the evil lies in the will, not in the organ of sense or action, and the removal of the instrument might leave the inward taint unpurified. What is meant is, that any sense, when it ministers to sin is an evil and not a good, the loss of which would be the truest gain. Translated into modern language, we are warned that taste, culture, æsthetic refinement may but make our guilt and our punishment more tremendous. It were better to be without them than<p>“Propter vitam vivendi perdere causas.”<p>[“ And for life’s sake to lose life’s noblest ends.”]<p><span class= "bld">It is profitable.</span>—The element of prudential self-love, of a calculation of profit and loss, is not excluded from Christian motives. As addressed to a nation immersed in the pursuit of gain, it conveys the stern, yet pertinent, warning—“If you must think of profit, make your calculations wisely.”<p><span class= "bld">Hell.</span>—Gehenna, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of the council: but whoever shall say, You fool, shall be in danger of hell fire.">Matthew 5:22</a>. The language is still symbolical. The horrid picture of a human body thrown into the foul, offal-fed flame of the Valley of Hinnom is again a parable of something more terrible than itself.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-29.htm" title="And if your right eye offend you, pluck it out, and cast it from you: for it is profitable for you that one of your members should perish, and not that your whole body should be cast into hell....">Matthew 5:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">If thy right eye offend thee </span>— If any person or thing, as pleasant and as dear to thee as thy right eye, should be a stumbling-block in thy way, and an occasion of thy falling, or should be a means of insnaring thee, and leading thee into sin, <span class="ital">pluck it out </span>— With inexorable resolution: that is, give up and part with the beloved object. <span class="ital">For it is profitable for thee </span>— It will be to thine advantage, <span class="ital">that one of thy members should perish </span>— To suffer an apparent temporary loss of pleasure or profit, rather than that thy whole soul and body should perish eternally, which yet would be the fatal consequence of thy indulging a favourite lust. <span class="ital">And if thy right hand offend, or insnare thee </span>— Though it be so useful and necessary a part, do not spare it, but immediately <span class="ital">cut it off and cast it from thee — </span>“The greatest part of Christ’s auditors were poor people, who lived by their daily labour; and to these the loss of a right hand would be a much greater calamity than that of a right eye: so that there is a gradation and force in this passage beyond what has generally been observed.” — Doddridge. There is an allusion, in both instances, to the practice of surgeons, who, when any member of the body happens to be mortified, cut it off, to prevent the sound part from being tainted. And the meaning of the passage, stripped of the metaphor, is this: By the force of a strong resolution, founded on the grace of God, deny thyself the use of thy senses, though ever so delightful, in all cases where the use of them insnares thy soul. Turn away thine eye, and keep back thy hand from the alluring object. This, says Chrysostom, is a most mild and easy precept. It would have been much more hard, had he given commandment to converse with and look curiously on women, and then abstain from further commission of uncleanness with them. Upon the whole, we learn from these two verses, that the salvation of our immortal souls is to be preferred beyond all things, be they never so dear and precious to us; and that, if men’s ordinary discretion teaches them, for the preservation of their bodies, to cut off a particular member, which would necessarily endanger the whole body, it much more teaches them to part with any thing which would prevent the salvation of their souls.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:27-32 Victory over the desires of the heart, must be attended with painful exertions. But it must be done. Every thing is bestowed to save us from our sins, not in them. All our senses and powers must be kept from those things which lead to transgression. Those who lead others into temptation to sin, by dress or in other ways, or leave them in it, or expose them to it, make themselves guilty of their sin, and will be accountable for it. If painful operations are submitted to, that our lives may be saved, what ought our minds to shrink from, when the salvation of our souls is concerned? There is tender mercy under all the Divine requirements, and the grace and consolations of the Spirit will enable us to attend to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thy right eye - The Hebrews, like others, were accustomed to represent the affections of the mind by the members or parts of the body, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-13.htm">Romans 6:13</a>. Thus, the bowels denoted compassion; the heart, affection or feeling; the reins, understanding, secret purpose. An evil eye denotes sometimes envy <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-15.htm">Matthew 20:15</a>, and sometimes an evil passion, or sin in general. <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-21.htm">Mark 7:21-22</a>; "out of the heart proceedeth an evil eye." In this place, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-14.htm">2 Peter 2:14</a>, the expression is used to denote strong adulterous passion, unlawful desire, or wicked inclination. The right eye and hand are mentioned, because they are of most use to us, and denote that, however strong the passion may be, or difficult to part with, yet that we should do it.<p>Offend thee - The noun from which the verb "offend," in the original, is derived, commonly means a stumbling-block, or a stone placed in the way, over which one might fall. It also means a net, or a certain part of a net against which, if a bird strikes, it springs the net, and is taken. It comes to signify, therefore, anything by which we fall, or are ensnared; and applied to morals, means anything by which we fall into sin, or by which we are ensnared. The English word "offend" means now, commonly, to displease; to make angry; to affront. This is by no means the sense of the word in Scripture. It means to cause to fall into sin. The eye does this when it wantonly looks upon a woman to lust after her.<p>Pluck it out ... - It cannot be supposed that Christ intended this to be taken literally. His design was to teach that the dearest objects, if they cause us to sin, are to be abandoned; that by all sacrifices and self-denials we must overcome the evil propensities of our nature, and resist our wanton imaginations. Some of the fathers, however, took this commandment literally. Our Saviour several times repeated this sentiment. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-9.htm">Matthew 18:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-47</a>. Compare also <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-5.htm">Colossians 3:5</a>.<p>It is profitable for thee - It is better for thee. You will have gained by it.<p>One of thy members perish - It is better to deny yourself the gratification of an evil passion here, however much it may cost you, than to go down to hell forever.<p>Thy whole body should be cast into hell - Thy body, with all its unsubdued and vicious propensities. This will constitute no small part of the misery of hell. The sinner will be sent there as he is, with every evil desire, every unsubdued propensity, every wicked and troublesome passion, and yet with no possibility of gratification. It constitutes our highest notions of misery when we think of a man filled with anger, pride, malice, avarice, envy and lust, and with no opportunity of gratifying them forever. This is all that is necessary to make an eternal hell. On the word hell, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-22.htm">Matthew 5:22</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

Of course, it is not the eye simply of which our Lord speaks&#8212;as if execution were to be done upon the bodily organ&#8212;though there have been fanatical ascetics who have both advocated and practiced this, showing a very low apprehension of spiritual things&#8212;but the offending eye, or the eye considered as the occasion of sin; and consequently, only the sinful exercise of the organ which is meant. For as one might put out his eyes without in the least quenching the lust to which they ministered, so, "if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be full of light," and, when directed by a holy mind, becomes an "instrument of righteousness unto God." At the same time, just as by cutting off a hand, or plucking out an eye, the power of acting and of seeing would be destroyed, our Lord certainly means that we are to strike at the root of such unholy dispositions, as well as cut off the occasions which tend to stimulate them.<p>for it is profitable for thee that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell&#8212;He who despises the warning to cast from him, with indignant promptitude, an offending member, will find his whole body "cast," with a retributive promptitude of indignation, "into hell."

Or "cause thee to offend", to stumble, and fall into sin. Our Lord has no regard here to near and dear relations seeking to alienate us from God and Christ, and hinder us in the pursuit of divine things; whose solicitations are to be rejected with the utmost indignation, and they themselves to be parted with, and forsaken, rather than complied with; which is the sense some give of the words: for both in this, and the following verse, respect is had only to the law of adultery; and to such members of the body, which often are the means of leading persons on to the breach of it; particularly the eye and hand. The eye is often the instrument of ensnaring the heart this way: hence the Jews have a (z) saying, <p>"whoever looks upon women, at the end comes into the hands of transgression.'' <p>Mention is only made of the right eye; not but that the left may be an occasion of sinning, as well as the right; but that being most dear and valuable, is instanced in, and ordered to be parted with: <p>pluck it out, and cast it from thee: which is not to be understood literally; for no man is obliged to mutilate any part of his body, to prevent sin, or on account of the commission of it; this is no where required, and if done, would be sinful, as in the case of Origen: but figuratively; and the sense is, that persons should make a covenant with their eyes, as Job did; and turn them away from beholding such objects, which may tend to excite impure thoughts and desires; deny themselves the gratification of the sense of seeing, or feeding the eyes with such sights, as are graceful to the flesh; and with indignation and contempt, reject, and avoid all opportunities and occasions of sinning; which the eye may be the instrument of, and lead unto: <p>for it is profitable for thee, that one of thy members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be cast into hell. This is still a continuation of the figure here used; and the meaning is, that it will turn to better account, to lose all the carnal pleasures of the eye, or all those pleasing sights, which are grateful to a carnal heart, than, by enjoying them, to expose the whole man, body and soul, to everlasting destruction, in the fire of hell. <p>(z) T.

Not the organ itself, but the <span class="ital">concupiscence</span> which animates the eye or hand is meant: for this is the soul of the eye where that organ proves a stumbling-block; in like manner as soon afterwards the body is said for the [whole] man [soul as well as body]. He who, where his eye proves a stumbling-block, takes care not to see, does in reality blind himself. On the other hand, a man might pluck out his material eye, and yet cherish concupiscence within. A similar mode of expression occurs in Coloss. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-5.htm" title="Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the region round about Jordan,">Matthew 3:5</a>, where the apostle says—<span class="ital">Mortify, therefore, your members which are upon the earth; fornication</span>, etc. A negative maxim is frequently expressed by affirming the opposite.—See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-39.htm" title="But I say to you, That you resist not evil: but whoever shall smite you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also....">Matthew 5:39-40</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-17.htm" title="But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;">Matthew 6:17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">βάλε</span>, <span class="ital">cast</span>) with earnestness. The expression <span class="greekheb">βληθῇ</span>, <span class="ital">be cast</span>) in the next verse has reference to this.—<span class="greekheb">συμφέρει</span>, <span class="ital">it is profitable</span>) to thy salvation. Not only is it not hurtful, but also it will be glorious.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπόληται</span>, <span class="ital">should perish</span>) True self-abnegation is not of less amount than the loss of an eye, etc.: and it is so necessary that it is better to be deprived of an eye itself, than to sin with the eye, unless the sin may be separated from the eye. An eye which is actually plucked out, as in the case of a martyr, will be restored in the resurrection.—<span class="greekheb">ἕν τῶν αελῶν σου</span>, <span class="ital">one of thy members</span>) Many, indeed, have been destroyed by neglecting the mortification of one member, as, for example, the gullet.—<span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμά σου</span>, <span class="ital">thy whole body</span>) If one member sin, the whole man sins and pays the penalty.—<span class="greekheb">γέενναν</span>, <span class="ital">hell</span>) of eternal fire.—See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm" title="Why if your hand or your foot offend you, cut them off, and cast them from you: it is better for you to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet to be cast into everlasting fire.">Matthew 18:8</a>, etc.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29, 30.</span> - Also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-8.htm">Matthew 18:8, 9</a> (parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-43.htm">Mark 9:43-47</a>); the chief differences being <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that they are there adduced with reference to "offences" generally; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> that the foot is mentioned, as well as the eye and the hand. It seems not improbable that this saying was spoken twice. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reason why our Lord did not mention the foot here may be either that that member is less immediately connected with sins of the flesh than the other two (cf. Wetstein, <span class="accented">in loc</span>., "Averte oculum a vultu illecebroso: arce manum ab impudicis contrectationibus"), or, as seems more probable, that the eye and the hand represent the two sets of faculties receptive and active, and together express man's whole nature. The insertion of the foot in ch. 18:8, 9, only makes the illustration more definite. "The remark in ver. 29f treats of what is to be done by the subjects of the kingdom when, in spite of themselves, evil desires are aroused" (Weiss, 'Life,' 2:149). <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 29.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Right</span>. Not in ch. 18, and parallel passage. Inserted to enhance the preciousness of the members spoken of (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-17.htm">Zechariah 11:17</a>; cf. ver. 39). <span class="cmt_word">Offend</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee;</span> Authorized Version, <span class="accented">do cause thee to offend</span>; Revised Version, <span class="accented">cause thee to stumble </span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;</span>). Perhaps the verb originally referred to the stick of a trap (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, a Hellenistic word, apparently equivalent to <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>) striking the person's foot, and so catching him in the trap; but when found in literature (almost solely in the New Testament) it has apparently lost all connotation of the trap, and only means causing a person to stumble (for an analysis of its use in the New Testament, <span class="accented">vide</span> especially Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v.</span>)<span class="accented">. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Pluck it out, and cast it from</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee.</span> The second clause shows the purely figurative character of the sentence. Our Lord commands <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the removal of the means of "<span class="accented">offence"</span> out of the place of affection that it has long held; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the putting it away so thoroughly, both by the manner of the act and the distance placed between the "offence" and the person, that restoration is almost impossible. In both verbs the aorist brings out the decisiveness of the action. <span class="cmt_word">For it is profitable for</span> <span class="cmt_word">thee that one of thy members should perish.</span> It is better to lose one faculty, one sphere of usefulness, one part of those things which normally make a person complete, than that the person himself should be lost. Notice the sixfold personal pronoun in this one verse; "Our Lord grounds his precept of the most rigid and decisive <span class="accented">self-denial</span> on the considerations of the <span class="accented">truest self interest"</span> (Alford). <span class="cmt_word">Should be cast</span>. For to One thy whole person will become as abhorrent as the offending member ought in fact now to be to thee (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x1f71;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1fc7;</span>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Offend (&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>The word offend carries to the English reader the sense of giving offence, provoking. Hence the Rev., by restoring the picture in the word, restores its true meaning, causeth to stumble. The kindred noun is &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, a later form of &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the stick in a trap on which the bait is placed, and which springs up and shuts the trap at the touch of an animal. Hence, generally, a snare, a stumbling-block. Christ's meaning here is: "If your eye or your hand serve as an obstacle or trap to ensnare or make you fall in your moral walk." How the eye might do this may be seen in the previous verse. Bengel observes: "He who, when his eye proves a stumbling-block, takes care not to see, does in reality blind himself." The words scandal and slander are both derived from &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;; and Wyc. renders, "If thy right eye slander thee." Compare Aeschylus, "Choephori," 301,372. </body></html>
