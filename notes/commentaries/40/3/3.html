In each case the reference shows how strongly the great second part of Isaiah had impressed itself on the minds of men. To the Baptist, brooding over the sins of his people, and the long-expected consolation of Israel, there had come “the word of the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-2.htm" title="Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.">Luke 3:2</a>), bidding him identify himself with that “voice of one crying in the wilderness.”<p>Historically, the connection of the opening chapters of this part of Isaiah with the protests against idolatry (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-18.htm" title="To whom then will you liken God? or what likeness will you compare to him?">Isaiah 40:18-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-7.htm" title="So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that smoothes with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It is ready for the soldering: and he fastened it with nails, that it should not be moved.">Isaiah 41:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/44-9.htm" title="They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be ashamed.">Isaiah 44:9-20</a>), and with the name of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm" title="That said of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, You shall be built; and to the temple, Your foundation shall be laid.">Isaiah 44:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, to subdue nations before him; and I will loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved gates; and the gates shall not be shut;">Isaiah 45:1</a>), shows that the prophet blended his glorious visions of the ideal polity of the future with the return of the exiles from Babylon. The return came, and the ideal was not realised. The kingdom of heaven seemed still far off. Now, the Baptist came to proclaim its nearness.<p><span class= "bld">Prepare ye the way of the Lord.</span>—The imagery is drawn from the great strategical works of the conquerors of the East. They sent a herald before them to call the people of the countries through which they marched to prepare for their approach. A “king’s highway” had to be carried through the open land of the wilderness, valleys filled up, and hills levelled (the words used are, of course, poetical in their greatness), winding bye-paths straightened, for the march of the great army. Interpreted in its spiritual application, the wilderness was the world lying in evil, and the making low the mountains and hills was the bringing down of spiritual pride. When the poor in spirit were received into the kingdom of heaven, the valleys were exalted; when soldier and publican renounced their special sins, the rough places were made plain and the crooked straight.<p>It is probable that the stress thus laid upon “the way of the Lord,” in the first stage of the Gospel, led to the peculiar use of the term “the way” by St. Luke, to denote what we should call the “religion” of the Apostolic Church (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm" title="And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/18-25.htm" title="This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spoke and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John.">Acts 18:25-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm" title="But when divers were hardened, and believed not, but spoke evil of that way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.">Acts 19:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-23.htm" title="And the same time there arose no small stir about that way.">Acts 19:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-4.htm" title="And I persecuted this way to the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.">Acts 22:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-14.htm" title="But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets:">Acts 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-22.htm" title="And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge of that way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will know the uttermost of your matter.">Acts 24:22</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">For this is he, </span>&c. — These may be the words of John himself, (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/1-22.htm" title="Then said they to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us.

As, however, the prophet intended, under the emblem of that deliverance of God’s people, to shadow out a redemption of an infinitely higher and more important nature, the evangelists, with the greatest propriety, apply his words to the opening of the gospel dispensation by the preaching of John, and to the introduction of the kingdom of the Messiah, who was to effect a much greater deliverance of the people of God, Gentiles as well as Jews, from the captivity of sin, and the power of death. And the same thing may be affirmed concerning many other passages of the prophets. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God....">Isaiah 40:3-4</a>. This expression, <span class="ital">The voice of one crying, </span>is as much as to say, <span class="ital">A herald is at hand proclaiming. </span>The word <span class="ital">crying, </span>implies that John’s testimony concerning Christ was uttered, not secretly, negligently, or doubtfully, but openly and publicly, freely, expressly, and resolutely, with a fervent spirit, and an audible, or strong voice. <span class="ital">In the wilderness </span>— These words are generally considered as connected with the preceding, so as to signify that John preached in the wilderness of Judea; and some interpret the expression figuratively as well as literally, and by <span class="ital">the wilderness of Judea, </span>understand the desert state of the Jewish Church at that time, destitute of religious culture, and the trees and fruits of righteousness. But Bishop Lowth connects Isaiah’s words with the following clause, and translates them, <span class="ital">A voice crieth: In the wilderness prepare ye the way of Jehovah, </span>which he thus interprets: “The prophet hears a crier giving orders, by solemn proclamation, to prepare the way of the Lord in the wilderness; to remove all obstructions before Jehovah marching through the desert; through the wild, uninhabited, and unpassable country;” the idea, he thinks, “being taken from the practice of the eastern monarchs, who, whenever they entered upon an expedition, or took a journey, especially through desert countries, sent harbingers before them to prepare all things for their passage, and pioneers to open the passes, to level the ways, and to remove all impediments.” Thus John the Baptist, the harbinger of Christ, who was <span class="ital">God manifest in the flesh, </span>is sent to prepare his way before him, by calling the people to repentance and to faith in him, their great Redeemer and Saviour. <span class="ital">Make his paths straight </span>— The paths of our God. Remove all obstructions out of his way, particularly all sin and unbelief, all carnal desires and worldly views, affections, and expectations, that your Saviour and your King may have a ready passage, and free access to your hearts, and may there erect his spiritual kingdom of <span class="ital">righteousness, peace, and joy in, </span>and by, <span class="ital">the Holy Ghost; </span>and may rule your lives, your whole conversation and conduct by his righteous and holy laws. Though this could only be done by divine grace, and it is grace which prepares for further grace, yet as man must concur with God, and <span class="ital">be a worker together with him, </span>John with propriety calls on the people thus to prepare the Lord’s way, that his grace might not be received in vain. The words imply that they were unprepared for receiving the Messiah and his salvation, which indeed they were in every sense, being neither in a fit disposition to relish, or even understand, his doctrine, to be convinced by his miracles, receive his Spirit, follow his example, rely on his mediation, or become his subjects. An earthly, sensual, and devilish disposition had taken possession of their minds and hearts, even the whole spirit of the world, and obstructed the entrance of Christ’s spiritual kingdom into them and among them. It was necessary, therefore, that these hinderances should be removed out of the way, that they might become the true people and followers of the Messiah.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prophet Esaias - The prophet Isaiah. Esaias is the Greek mode of writing the name. This passage is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. It is here said to have been spoken in reference to John, the forerunner of Christ. The language is such as was familiar to the Jews. and such as they would understand. It was spoken at first with reference to the return from the captivity at Babylon. In ancient times, it was customary in the march of armies to send messengers, or pioneers, before them to proclaim their approach; to provide for them; to remove obstructions; to make roads, level hills, fill up valleys, etc. Isaiah, describing the return from Babylon, uses language taken from that custom. A crier, or herald, is introduced. In the vast deserts that lay between Babylon and Judea he is represented as lifting up his voice, and, with authority, commanding a public road to be made for the return of the captive Jews, with the Lord as their deliverer. "Prepare his ways, make them straight," says he. The meaning in Isaiah is, "Let the valleys be exalted, or filled up, and the hills be levelled, and a straight, level highway be prepared, that they may march with ease and safety." See the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3-4</a>. The custom here referred to is continued in the East at the present time. "When Ibrahim Pasha proposed to visit certain places on Lebanon, the emeers and sheiks sent forth a general proclamation, somewhat in the style of Isaiah's exhortation, to all the inhabitants, to assemble along the proposed route and prepare the way before him. The same was done in 1845, on a grand scale, when the present sultan visited Brousa. The stones were gathered out, the crooked places straightened, and the rough ones made level and smooth." - The Land and the Book, Vol i. pp. 105, 106.<p>As applied to John, the passage means that he was sent to remove obstructions, and to prepare the people for the coming of the Messiah, like a herald going before an army on the march, to make preparations for its coming. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying&#8212;(Mt 11:3).<p>The voice of one crying in the wilderness&#8212;(See on [1213]Lu 3:2); the scene of his ministry corresponding to its rough nature.<p>Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight&#8212;This prediction is quoted in all the four Gospels, showing that it was regarded as a great outstanding one, and the predicted forerunner as the connecting link between the old and the new economies. Like the great ones of the earth, the Prince of peace was to have His immediate approach proclaimed and His way prepared; and the call here&#8212;taking it generally&#8212;is a call to put out of the way whatever would obstruct His progress and hinder His complete triumph, whether those hindrances were public or personal, outward or inward. In Luke (Lu 3:5, 6) the quotation is thus continued: "Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low; and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough ways shall be made smooth; and all flesh shall see the salvation of God." Levelling and smoothing are here the obvious figures whose sense is conveyed in the first words of the proclamation&#8212;"Prepare ye the way of the Lord." The idea is that every obstruction shall be so removed as to reveal to the whole world the salvation of God in Him whose name is the "Saviour." (Compare Ps 98:3; Isa 11:10; 49:6; 52:10; Lu 2:31, 32; Ac 13:47).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> It is not much material whether we understand these words as the words of the evangelist concerning John, as it should seem by <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-3.htm" title="The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Mark 1:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-4.htm" title="As it is written in the book of the words of Esaias the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Luke 3:4</a></span>, or the words of John himself, for he thus spake, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm" title="He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.">John 1:23</a></span>.

The words are judged literally, but typically, to concern Cyrus and Darius, and either these princes, who were instrumental in the restoring of the Jews to their liberty from the captivity of Babylon, or those prophets who encouraged them to their return, or upon their return to build the temple and city.

These are not the words of the Baptist himself, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> but of the Evangelist, who cites and applies to John a passage in the Prophet Isaiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> and that very pertinently, since that "chapter" is a prophecy of the Messiah. The consolations spoken of in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>, were to be in the days of the king Messiah, as a writer of note (y) among the Jews observes. The Messiah is more expressly prophesied of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-9.htm">Isaiah 40:9</a> as one that should appear to the joy of his people, and "come with a strong hand", vigorously prosecute his designs, faithfully perform his work, and then receive his reward; he is spoken of under the "character" of a "shepherd", who would tenderly discharge the several parts of his office as such, which character is frequently given to the Messiah in the Old Testament: now the person spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a> was to be his harbinger to go before him, proclaim and make ready for his coming; and what is said of him agrees entirely with John the Baptist, as the character given of him, <p>the voice of one crying,  lowing like an ox; which expresses the austerity of the man, the roughness of his voice, the severity of his language; that he called aloud and spoke out, openly, publicly, and freely; and that he delivered himself in preaching with a great deal of zeal and fervency. The place where he preached was "in the wilderness", that is, of Judea, where he is said before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm">Matthew 3:1</a> to come preaching. The doctrine he preached was, <p>prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight, which is best explained by what is said before, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a><p>repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. The Lord whom ye have sought, the Messiah whom you have expected, is just coming, he will quickly appear; prepare to meet him by repentance, and receive him by faith, relinquish your former notions and principles, correct your errors, and amend your lives, remove all out of the way which may be offensive to him. The allusion is to a great personage being about to make his public appearance or entrance; when a harbinger goes before him, orders the way to be cleared, all impediments to be removed, and everything got ready for the reception of him. <p>(y) R.

He finds in John the man of prophecy who proclaims in the desert the near advent of Jehovah coming to deliver His people. He quotes <span class="ital">Isaiah</span> only. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm" title="As it is written in the prophets, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.">Mark 1:2</a>) quotes <span class="ital">Malachi</span> also, identifying John, not only with the voice in the desert, but with Elijah. Isaiah’s herald is not merely a type of John in the view of the evangelist; the two are identical. The quotation follows the Sept[12], except that for <span class="greekheb">τοῦ θεοῦ ἡμῶν</span> is substituted <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span>. Note where Matthew stops. Luke, the universalist, goes on to the end of the oracle. The mode of introducing the prophetic citation is peculiar. “This is he,” not “that it might be fulfilled”. Weiss (Meyer) thinks this an indication that the passage is taken from “the apostolic source”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[12] Septuagint.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">by</span>] See note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-5.htm" title="And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is written by the prophet,">Matthew 2:5</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by the prophet Esaias</span>] The reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm" title="The voice of him that cries in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our God.">Isaiah 40:3</a> is to the promised return from Babylon.

Some construe this passage thus, “<span class="ital">Prepare ye in the wilderness</span>, etc,” because the accents[118] in the original Hebrew of Isaiah require it to be so construed there. But if such had been the evangelist’s meaning, he would subsequently have expressed, in equivalent terms, the parallel phrase <span class="greekheb">בערבה</span>, <span class="ital">in the desert</span>.[119] As the passage stands, the expressions, “<span class="ital">preaching in the wilderness</span>,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a>, and “a <span class="ital">voice of one crying in the wilderness</span>,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-3.htm" title="For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.">Matthew 3:3</a>, correspond with each other. It comes to the same thing: for where there is the voice, there also are the hearers who are commanded to prepare the way, and there is the Coming of the Lord. St Matthew, also, in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-15.htm" title="The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;">Matthew 4:15</a>, contains something different from the Hebrew accents.—Cf.

In this passage Christ is intended. The appellation <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span>, <span class="ital">Lord</span>, when applied to Christ in the New Testament, has various meanings, according to the variety of circumstances, times, and speakers. In passages quoted from the Old Testament it frequently corresponds to the names <span class="greekheb">יהוה </span>and <span class="greekheb">אדני</span>, of which the one expresses His majesty as the Son of God, the other, His glory also as the Messiah. Men amongst whom He walked addressed Him thus with various purport, according to the various extent of their faith. From that time forward, the apostles, and the faithful in general, frequently employed this appellation with reference to His dominion and authority over His own followers, and over all things beside, even in His state of humiliation,[120] but rather in His state of exaltation: in which cases the pronoun “<span class="ital">my</span>” is sometimes added, which is never joined with the tetragrammaton <span class="greekheb">יהוה</span>.—<span class="greekheb">εὐθείας</span>) <span class="ital">straight</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[117] “Clamantis”—<span class="ital">crying out</span>, uttering with a loud voice—not <span class="ital">weeping</span>.—(I.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-23.htm">John 1:23</a> the following quotation is uttered by the Baptist himself, and some commentators have supposed this to be the case also here. But <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> this is against the parallel passages in Mark and Luke. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> The form of the expression in John arises directly from the context. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> In the Baptist's mouth the neuter (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;</span>... <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1fe4;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;</span>) rather than the masculine would have been more natural. The expression is doubtless that of the evangelist, suggested to him by John's own utterance, the "is" (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>) expressing John's permanent character. Contrast <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x3ca;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b7;&#x1fee;&#x3bd;</span>, (ver. 4) of his clothing and food. [<span class="accented">He that was</span>] <span class="accented">spoken of.</span> The expression means, not a mere reference found in Isaiah, but the absolute content of the prophet's words. The utterance of God by means of the prophet is - John the:Baptist. <span class="cmt_word">The Prophet Esaias</span>; <span class="accented">Isaiah the prophet</span> (Revised Version); the commoner Greek order (but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-17.htm">Luke 4:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The voice</span>, etc. (except "his" for "our God," from the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-8.htm">Isaiah 40:8</a>). The Hebrew probably joins "in the wilderness" with "prepare ye," but St. Matthew with "crying" (cf ver. 1, "preaching in the wilderness," as probably the LXX.) In Isaiah the original meaning of the passage was probably, "prepare for the return to Jerusalem." The figure is that of the common and necessary process in semi-civilized countries of repairing roads before a great personage comes along them. Zechariah had; years before, applied the similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> to his son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-76.htm">Luke 1:76</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2</a>). (For a metaphor like in kind, but with contrasted meaning, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-7.htm">Galatians 5:7</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>, breaking up a road to render it impassable.) <span class="cmt_word">Paths</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>). According to Philo, the word is equivalent to "a carriage-road" (<span class="greek">&#x1f31;&#x3c0;&#x3c0;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x3b4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">vide</span> in Wetstein). It is thus equivalent to the Hebrew (<span class="accented">m</span> <span class="accented">sillah</span>, "a highway," "a made road"). Possibly the plural was employed by the LXX. rather than the singular of the original, from their interpreting the passage, not of the return of the Lord to Palestine, but his coming into many hearts. </body></html>
