Did John thus forbid Him, as knowing Him to be the Christ? If so, how did that knowledge come? Had they known each other before, in youth or manhood? Or did a special inspiration reveal the character of Him who now drew near? The narrative of St. Matthew seems to imply such knowledge. On the other hand, the words of the Baptist in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a> not only imply, but assert that he did not know Him till after the wonders of the Baptism. Probably, therefore, the sequence of facts was this: The Lord Jesus came to be baptised, as others did, though not, it would seem, with others. He confessed no sins. Look and tone, and words and silence alike spoke of a sinless and stainless life, such as even in approximate instances impresses us with something like awe in presence of the majesty of holiness. Recognising that holiness the Baptist spake as he did, “I have need to be baptised of Thee, to sit at Thy feet, learning lessons of purity and change of heart from Thee.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a></span>. <span class="ital">But John forbade him </span>— Out of modesty he would have declined the service, saying, <span class="ital">I have need to be baptized of thee </span>— To receive a larger measure of the gifts and graces of the Holy Spirit from thee, <span class="ital">and comest thou to me </span>— on such an occasion as this? It has been questioned, how John knew him to be the Christ, before the Spirit descended on him? But this question will be easily resolved, if it be considered that John was a prophet <span class="ital">filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother’s womb. </span>No doubt he knew by a secret intimation from that Spirit, that he, who then came to him, was the person on whom the Holy Ghost should descend, and on whom he should abide in so large a measure, or, rather, without measure, that he might impart him to others, such matters being frequently imparted to prophets by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. Thus Simeon, having been told that he should not die until he had seen the Lord’s Christ, had an intimation given him in the temple that the child Jesus was that Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/2-26.htm" title="And it was revealed to him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord's Christ....">Luke 2:26-32</a>; as had, also, Anna the prophetess.

And those who have much of the Spirit of God while here, see that they need to apply to Christ for more. Christ does not deny that John had need to be baptized of him, yet declares he will now be baptized of John. Christ is now in a state of humiliation. Our Lord Jesus looked upon it as well becoming him to fulfil all righteousness, to own every Divine institution, and to show his readiness to comply with all God's righteous precepts. In and through Christ, the heavens are opened to the children of men. This descent of the Spirit upon Christ, showed that he was endued with his sacred influences without measure. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. At Christ's baptism there was a manifestation of the three Persons in the sacred Trinity. The Father confirming the Son to be Mediator; the Son solemnly entering upon the work; the Holy Spirit descending on him, to be through his mediation communicated to his people. In Him our spiritual sacrifices are acceptable, for He is the altar that sanctifies every gift, 1Pe 2:5. Out of Christ, God is a consuming fire, but in Christ, a reconciled Father. This is the sum of the gospel, which we must by faith cheerfully embrace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>John forbade him - Refused him.<p>I have need - It is more suitable that I should be baptized with thy baptism, the Holy Spirit, than that thou shouldest be baptized in water by me.

The emphasis of this most remarkable speech lies all in the pronouns: "What! Shall the Master come for baptism to the servant&#8212;the sinless Saviour to a sinner?" That thus much is in the Baptist's words will be clearly seen if it be observed that he evidently regarded Jesus as Himself needing no purification but rather qualified to impart it to those who did. And do not all his other testimonies to Christ fully bear out this sense of the words? But it were a pity if, in the glory of this testimony to Christ, we should miss the beautiful spirit in which it was borne&#8212;"Lord, must I baptize Thee? Can I bring myself to do such a thing?"&#8212;reminding us of Peter's exclamation at the supper table, "Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?" while it has nothing of the false humility and presumption which dictated Peter's next speech. "Thou shalt never wash my feet" (Joh 13:6, 8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He did not absolutely repel him, but modestly excused himself for a time, knowing that Christ was already baptized with a more excellent baptism than he could administer to him, for God gave him the Spirit not by measure, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm" title="For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God: for God gives not the Spirit by measure to him.">John 3:34</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But John forbad him, saying,.... It appears from hence, that John knew Christ before he baptized him, and before he saw the Spirit descending and abiding on him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm">John 1:33</a> wherefore that was not a signal, whereby he should first know him but whereby his knowledge of him should be confirmed; which knowledge of him he had, not through his kindred to him, or by any conversation he had with him before, but by immediate, divine revelation: upon which account he "forbad him"; refused to administer the ordinance to him; earnestly entreated that he would not insist upon it; desired to be excused being concerned herein: and this he did, partly lest the people should think Christ was not so great a person as he had represented him to be; yea, that he was one of the penitent sinners John had admitted to his baptism; and chiefly because of the majesty and dignity of Christ's person, who he knew stood in no need of such an outward ordinance; and because of his own unworthiness to administer it to him, as is evident from what follows, <p>I have need to be baptized of thee; not with water baptism, which Christ never administered, but with the baptism of the Spirit, which was his peculiar office. Hence we learn, that though John was so holy a man, was filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb, had such large measures of grace, and lived such an exemplary life and conversation; yet was far from thinking, that he was perfect and righteous in himself, but stood in need of Christ, and of more grace from him. He seems surprised that Christ should come to him, and make such a motion to him; when it was his duty and privilege to come to him daily for fresh supplies of grace, and always to trust in him for life and salvation; <p>and comest thou to me? who am of the earth, earthly, when thou art the Lord from heaven; "to me", a poor sinful creature, when thou art the Holy One of God; "to me", who am thy servant, when thou art Lord of all; "to me", who always stand in need of thy grace, when thou art God all sufficient. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a>. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>, it was revealed to the Baptist that He upon whom he should see the Spirit descending was the Messiah. It was accordingly not until this moment that the <span class="ital">recognition</span> of Jesus as the Messiah entered his mind; and therefore, in the Gospel of John, he says of the time which <span class="ital">preceded</span> this moment: <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ οὐκ ᾔδειν αὐτόν</span>. The passage before us is not in contradiction with this, for the <span class="ital">recognition</span> of the Messiahship of Jesus does not yet lie at its foundation, but <span class="ital">the prophetic anticipation</span> of the same, which on the approach of Jesus, as that solemn decision was about to begin through the revelation of the <span class="greekheb">σημεῖον</span>, seized the soul of the Baptist involuntarily and miraculously, and yet psychologically, in keeping with the spiritual <span class="ital">rapport</span> prepared by revelation. Comp. Luther: “he <span class="ital">scents</span> the Spirit.” Accordingly, we are not to assume in our passage either a recognition only of higher excellence (Hess, Paulus, Hofmann), or a contradiction with John (Strauss, de Wette, Keim), or, after Lücke, Holtzmann, and Scholten, that the oldest and shortest tradition of Matthew contained merely <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-16.htm" title="And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of the water: and, see, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting on him:...">Matthew 3:16-17</a>, while <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?...">Matthew 3:14-15</a> were a later addition of the complete Matthew,[383] which Hilgenfeld seeks to support from the silence of Justin regarding the refusal of the Baptist, whilst Keim gives, indeed, the preference to the statement of Matthew over that of John, but still allows it to be very problematical.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διεκώλυεν</span>] Stronger than the simple verb. The word (which does not occur elsewhere in the N. T. nor in the LXX., yet in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/4-7.htm" title="Charging them to keep the passages of the hill country: for by them there was an entrance into Judea, and it was easy to stop them that would come up, because the passage was straight, for two men at the most.">Jdt 4:7</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/12-7.htm" title="Then Holofernes commanded his guard that they should not stay her: thus she abode in the camp three days, and went out in the night into the valley of Bethulia, and washed herself in a fountain of water by the camp.">Jdt 12:7</a>, and frequently in the classical writers) is <span class="ital">selected</span>, in keeping with the serious opposition of the astonished John. The <span class="ital">imperfect</span> is <span class="ital">descriptive</span>, and, indeed, so much so, that “vere incipit actus, sed ob impedimenta caret eventu,” Schaefer, <span class="ital">ad Eur. Phoen</span>. 81. Kühner, II. 1, p. 123. John actually repelled Jesus, and <span class="ital">did not baptize Him at once</span>, but only when the latter had made representations to the contrary effect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ χρείαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Grotius: <span class="ital">Si alter nostrum omnino baptizandus sit, ego potius abs te, ut dignissimo, baptismum petere debui</span>. Thus spoke John in the truest feeling of his own lowliness and sinfulness, in the presence of the long-longed for One, the first recognition of whom suddenly thrilled him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ σὺ ἔρχῃ πρός με</span>;] A question indicative of the <span class="ital">astonishment</span> with which the Baptist, although he had received the divine declaration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>, was yet seized, through the impression made on him by the <span class="ital">presence</span> of the Lord. Moreover, this discourse necessarily excludes the idea that he too connected the baptism of Jesus with the profession of a confession of His sins. Yet the apocryphal <span class="ital">Praedicatio Pauli</span>, according to Cyprian, <span class="ital">Opp</span>. p. 142, Rigalt (Credner, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. I. p. 360 ff.), had already made Jesus deliver a confession of sin; in the <span class="ital">Evangelium sec. Hebraeos</span>, on the other hand, quoted by Jerome, <span class="ital">c. Pel</span>. iii. 1, Jesus answers the request of His mother and His brethren to let Himself be baptized along with them: “Quid peccavi, ut vadam et baptizer ab eo? nisi forte hoc ipsum quod dixi ignorantia est.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[383] According to Epiphanius, <span class="ital">Haer</span>. xxx. 13, the Gospel according to the Hebrews contained the conversation, although with embellishments, but placed it <span class="ital">after</span> the baptism. The want of originality of this narrative <span class="ital">in itself</span> (in answer to Schneckenburger, Hilgenfeld) already shows its apocryphal and extravagant character. The correctness of its <span class="ital">position</span> has found favour, indeed, with Bleek (p. 179 f., and in the <span class="ital">Stud. u. Krit</span>. 1833, p. 436), Usteri (in the same, 1829, p. 446), and Lücke, and Keim also, at the expense of our Gospel; but, after what has been said above, without any reason, as the want of agreement between Matthew and John is only apparent, and is not to be removed by changing the meaning of the simple and definite <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ᾔδειν αὐτόν</span>. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a>. The <span class="ital">Wolfenbüttel Fragmentist</span> (<span class="ital">vom Zwecke Jesu</span>, p. 133 ff.) has notoriously misused <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm" title="And I knew him not: but that he should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.">John 1:31</a> to assert that Jesus and John had long been acquainted with each other, and had come to an understanding to work to each other’s hands, but to conceal this from the people.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?...">Matthew 3:14-15</a>. <span class="ital">John refuses</span>. It is instructive to compare the three synoptical evangelists in their respective narratives of the baptism of Jesus. Mark (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-9.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John in Jordan.">Mark 1:9</a>) simply states the fact. Matthew reports perplexities created in the mind of John by the desire of Jesus to be baptised, and presumably in the minds of Christians for whom he wrote. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-21.htm" title="Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened,">Luke 3:21</a>) passes lightly over the event in a participial clause, as if consoious that he was on delicate ground. The three narratives exhibit successive phases of opinion on the subject, a fact not without bearing on the dates and relations of the three Gospels. Matthew represents the intermediate phase. His account is intrinsically credible.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">forbad him</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">was preventing</span>, or, <span class="bld">endeavoured to prevent</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-14.htm" title="But John forbade him, saying, I have need to be baptized of you, and come you to me?">Matthew 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">Διεκώλυεν</span>, <span class="ital">forbade</span>) John had not yet known that this was the Messiah. He had known, however, that the Messiah was close at hand, and that He would come to his baptism, and be indicated by a clear sign; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-33.htm" title="And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, On whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on him, the same is he which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.">John 1:33</a>. In the meanwhile, as soon as he sees Jesus, from that sympathy by which he had been moved in the womb, and from His most gracious aspect, he judges that this candidate for baptism must be the Messiah, and skilfully declares his conviction by a previous protest.[133] See Luther’s Kirchen Postille, on this passage, Fest. Epiph., Part II., ed. Spen., ff. 95, 96.—<span class="greekheb">ἐγὼ</span>, <span class="ital">I</span>) It is probable that John himself had not been baptized: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm" title="For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from his mother's womb.">Luke 1:15</a>, fin.—<span class="greekheb">χρεὶαν</span>, <span class="ital">need</span>) For it is elsewhere the part of the greater to baptize, of the less to be baptized, and to come on that account to one who baptizes.—<span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ Σοῦ βαπτισθῆναι</span>, <span class="ital">to be baptized by Thee</span>) sc. with Thy baptism of the Spirit and of fire.

Germ</span>. Subsequently, by reason of the sign which, in accordance with the promise of God, was added after the baptism, John was so much the more confirmed and fitted for bearing testimony of Jesus being the Son of GOD.—<span class="ital">Harm.</span>, p. 146.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - Vers. 14 and 15 are peculiar to St. Matthew. <span class="cmt_word">But John</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31, 33</a> the Baptist says that he knew him not till the descent of the Holy Spirit; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> knew him not in his full Messianic character. Here, <span class="accented">either</span> by an involuntary and miraculous impression, psychologically due to the previous revelation he had received (cf. Meyer); or, as is on the whole more probable, from his previous knowledge, direct or indirect, of Jesus, he recognizes his superior sanctity. John's inmost thoughts must therefore have been somewhat as follows. "I have come to announce the advent of Messiah; here is One who is much holier than I; it may be that he is Messiah, but I have no certainty till the sign promised has been vouchsafed." <span class="cmt_word">Forbade</span>; <span class="accented">would have hindered</span> (Revised Version), for <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>, does not in itself imply speech. (For a similar imperfect of that which was not fully carried out, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>.) It is noticeable, though doubtless merely as a coincidence, that the strong compound word <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c9;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> also occur together in Judith 12:7. <span class="cmt_word">I have need to be baptized of thee</span>. Many see here a reference to the baptism of the Spirit and fire, mentioned in ver. 11. But the following clause, "and dost thou come to me?" implies that the baptisms are identical, viz. baptism by water. The sentence is equivalent to "I John, who myself administer the baptism of repentance, need to profess repentance myself, and ought rather, therefore, to receive such a baptism at thy hands, who art so far holier than I" (cf. further Weiss, 'Life,' 1:320). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Forbad (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c5;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;)<p>The A. V., following Wyc. and Tynd., misses the meaning of the verb. As in so many instances, it overlooks the force of the imperfect tense, which expresses past action, either in progress or in process of conception, in the agent's mind. John did not forbid Jesus, but had it in mind to prevent him: was for hindering him. Hence Rev., properly, would have hindered him. Again, the preposition (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#769;) intensifies the verb, and represents strong feeling on John's part. He was moved to strenuous protest against Jesus' baptism by him. </body></html>
