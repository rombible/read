Luke 1. The manner in which he is mentioned here shows that his name was already well known to all readers of the Gospel. So, in like manner, Josephus names him as popularly known by the same title (<span class= "ital">Ant.</span> xviii. 5, § 2), and describes his work as that of a preacher of repentance in nearly the same terms as St. Matthew. The symbolism of ablution as the outward sign of inward purification was, of course, derived from the Mosaic ritual. It was ordered for the consecration of the priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-4.htm" title="And Aaron and his sons you shall bring to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall wash them with water.">Exodus 29:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm" title="And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.">Leviticus 8:6</a>), for the purification of the leper and other unclean persons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm" title="And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.">Leviticus 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/15-31.htm" title="Thus shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.">Leviticus 15:31-32</a>). It had received a fresh prominence from the language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-16.htm" title="Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil;">Isaiah 1:16</a>, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm" title="Then will I sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.">Ezekiel 36:25</a>, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-1.htm" title="In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness.">Zechariah 13:1</a>, and probably (though the date of the practice cannot be fixed with certainty) from its being used on the admission of proselytes, male or female, from heathenism. The question asked by the priests and Levites in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-25.htm" title="And they asked him, and said to him, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, nor Elias, neither that prophet?">John 1:25</a> implies that it was expected as one of the signs of the coming of the Messiah, probably as the result of the prophecies just referred to. That which distinguished the baptism of John from all previous forms of the same symbolism was, that it was not for those only who were affected by a special uncleanness, nor for the heathen only, but for all. All were alike unclean, and needed purification, and their coming to the baptism was in itself a confession that they were so. The baptism was, as the name implied, an immersion, and commonly, though not necessarily, in running water.<p>The abrupt way in which the narrative is introduced “in those days,” after an interval of thirty years from the close of Matthew 2, may be explained as referring to the well-known period of the commencement of John’s ministry; or it may loosely refer to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm" title="Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.">Matthew 1:23</a>, and imply that time had gone on with no change in the general circumstances. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/2-11.htm" title="And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting an Hebrew, one of his brothers.">Exodus 2:11</a>. See Excursus on the intervening History in the <span class= "ital">Notes</span> on this Gospel.)<p><span class= "bld">Came.</span>—Literally, with the vividness of the historic present, <span class= "ital">cometh.</span><p><span class= "bld">Preaching.</span>—Here, as everywhere in the New Testament, the word implies proclaiming after the manner of a <span class= "ital">herald.</span><p><span class= "bld">In the wilderness of Judæa.</span>—The name was commonly applied to the thinly populated region in the southern valley of the Jordan, and so was equivalent to “the country about Jordan” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-3.htm" title="And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;">Luke 3:3</a>, including even part of the district east of the river. In this region John had grown up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-80.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.">Luke 1:80</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-1.htm" title="In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judaea,">Matthew 3:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">In those days </span>— That is, in those years. For, as these events happened near thirty years after those recorded in the former chapter, this phrase is to be taken, in a very extensive sense, for that age of which he had spoken in the preceding words. And it is here used with the greater propriety, because John did indeed appear in his public character while Christ continued to dwell at Nazareth, which was the event that Matthew had last mentioned. Christ was now about thirty years of age, before which time of life no priest, teacher, or prophet was allowed to perform his office, as the Hebrews tell us, and as may be collected from the Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/23-3.htm" title="Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was thirty and eight thousand.">1 Chronicles 23:3</a>. Hence we learn that great preparation is necessary for sacred offices. The evangelists, therefore, pass over almost in entire silence our Saviour’s minority, only mentioning his disputing with the doctors in the temple, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-46.htm" title="And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the middle of the doctors, both hearing them, and asking them questions.">Luke 2:46</a>. And yet it is probable many other remarkable things happened during that period, which, if they had been recorded, we should have read with pleasure and profit. But as the Holy Ghost has not been pleased to favour us in this respect, let us be thankful for, and duly improve, what is made known to us. <span class="ital">Came John </span>— The son of Zacharias and Elizabeth, who had lived for several years retired in the wilderness of Judea: <span class="ital">the Baptist </span>— So called, either because he was the first who, by God’s command, baptized penitents, or because by him God instituted the ordinance of baptism. For, admitting that the Jews received proselytes by baptism, yet he baptized Jews themselves, and from his time the ordinance of baptism must be dated. Before Christ’s entering upon the first part of his work, that of declaring the will of God, was recorded, it was necessary that the office of John should be spoken of, because he was his harbinger, or forerunner, and proclaimed his coming beforehand; and because, at the time of John’s baptizing Jesus, the Holy Ghost visibly descended on him, and consecrated him to his prophetic office. <span class="ital">Preaching </span>— The original word, <span class="greekheb">κηρυσσων</span>, means <span class="ital">proclaiming, </span>or <span class="ital">crying aloud. </span>It is properly used of those who make proclamation in the streets or camps, or who lift up their voice in the open air, and declare the things which are to be promulgated by public or royal authority, and which they have in charge from another. <span class="ital">In the wilderness of Judea </span>— That is, in the uncultivated and thinly-inhabited parts of Judea, where, it seems, his father Zacharias lived, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/1-39.htm" title="And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Juda;...">Luke 1:39-40</a>. For we are not to suppose that John shunned the society of men, as those afterward did, who, on that account, were called <span class="ital">hermits; </span>but he had been brought up and had always lived in the country, and not in the city, and had had a plain country education, and not an academical or courtly one, at Jerusalem. We must observe, that the term <span class="ital">wilderness, </span>among the Jews, did not signify a place wholly void of inhabitants, but a place in which they were fewer, and their habitations more dispersed, than in villages and cities. Hence we read of six cities with their villages, in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/15-61.htm" title="In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,...">Joshua 15:61-62</a>; that <span class="ital">Nabal </span>dwelt in the wilderness of Paran, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/25-1.htm" title="And Samuel died; and all the Israelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his house at Ramah. And David arose, and went down to the wilderness of Paran....">1 Samuel 25:1-2</a>; and Joab had his house in the wilderness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-34.htm" title="So Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell on him, and slew him: and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.">1 Kings 2:34</a>. John began his preaching in the desert, in which he had been brought up, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-80.htm" title="And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.">Luke 1:80</a>, as Jesus, in like manner, began his in Galilee, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-37.htm" title="That word, I say, you know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;">Acts 10:37</a>. There was, however, this difference between them, that Christ preached in Galilee, a country the most populous of any in that neighbourhood, but John in the desert, that is, in a place but thinly inhabited, and little cultivated. The former of which was suitable to the benignity of our Saviour, and the latter to the austerity of his forerunner. Lastly, John, who had begun to preach in Judea, is imprisoned and put to death in the dominions of Herod; Christ, on the other hand, who entered upon his ministry in the tetrarchy of Herod, is crucified at Jerusalem, in Judea.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 After Malachi there was no prophet until John the Baptist came. He appeared first in the wilderness of Judea. This was not an uninhabited desert, but a part of the country not thickly peopled, nor much enclosed. No place is so remote as to shut us out from the visits of Divine grace. The doctrine he preached was repentance; Repent ye. The word here used, implies a total alteration in the mind, a change in the judgment, disposition, and affections, another and a better bias of the soul. Consider your ways, change your minds: you have thought amiss; think again, and think aright. True penitents have other thoughts of God and Christ, sin and holiness, of this world and the other, than they had. The change of the mind produces a change of the way. That is gospel repentance, which flows from a sight of Christ, from a sense of his love, and from hopes of pardon and forgiveness through him. It is a great encouragement to us to repent; repent, for your sins shall be pardoned upon your repentance. Return to God in a way of duty, and he will, through Christ, return unto you in the way of mercy. It is still as necessary to repent and humble ourselves, to prepare the way of the Lord, as it then was. There is a great deal to be done, to make way for Christ into a soul, and nothing is more needful than the discovery of sin, and a conviction that we cannot be saved by our own righteousness. The way of sin and Satan is a crooked way; but to prepare a way for Christ, the paths must be made straight, Heb 12:13. Those whose business it is to call others to mourn for sin, and to mortify it, ought themselves to live a serious life, a life of self-denial, and contempt of the world. By giving others this example, John made way for Christ. Many came to John's baptism, but few kept to the profession they made. There may be many forward hearers, where there are few true believers. Curiosity, and love for novelty and variety, may bring many to attend on good preaching, and to be affected for a while, who never are subject to the power of it. Those who received John's doctrine, testified their repentance by confessing their sins. Those only are ready to receive Jesus Christ as their righteousness, who are brought with sorrow and shame to own their guilt. The benefits of the kingdom of heaven, now at hand, were thereupon sealed to them by baptism. John washed them with water, in token that God would cleanse them from all their iniquities, thereby intimating, that by nature and practice all were polluted, and could not be admitted among the people of God, unless washed from their sins in the fountain Christ was to open, Zec 13:1.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In those days - The days here referred to cannot be those mentioned in the preceding chapter, for John was but six months older than Christ. Perhaps Matthew intended to embrace in his narrative the whole time that Jesus lived at Nazareth; and the meaning is, "in those days while Jesus still dwelt at Nazareth," John began to preach. It is not probable that John began to baptize or preach long before the Saviour entered on his ministry; and, consequently, from the time that is mentioned in the close of the second chapter to that mentioned in the beginning of the third, an interval of twenty-five years or more elapsed.<p>John the Baptist - Or John the baptizer - so called from his principal office, that of baptizing. Baptism, or the application of water, was a rite well known to the Jews, and practiced when they admitted proselytes to their religion from paganism. - Lightfoot.<p>Preaching - The word rendered "preach" means to proclaim in the manner of a public crier; to make proclamation. The discourses recorded in the New Testament are mostly brief, sometimes consisting only of a single sentence. They were public proclamations of some great truth. Such appear to have been the discourses of John, calling people to repentance.<p>In the wilderness of Judea - This country was situated along the Jordan and the Dead Sea, to the east of Jerusalem. The word translated "wilderness" does not denote, as with us, a place of boundless forests, entirely destitute of inhabitants; but a mountainous, rough, and thinly settled country, covered to some considerable extent with forests and rocks, and better suited for pasture than for tilling. There were inhabitants in those places, and even villages, but they were the comparatively unsettled portions of the country, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-1.htm">1 Samuel 25:1-2</a>. In the time of Joshua there were six cities in what was then called a wilderness, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61-62</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 3<p>Mt 3:1-12. Preaching and Ministry of John. ( = Mr 1:1-8; Lu 3:1-18).<p>For the proper introduction to this section, we must go to Lu 3:1, 2. Here, as Bengel well observes, the curtain of the New Testament is, as it were, drawn up, and the greatest of all epochs of the Church commences. Even our Lord's own age is determined by it (Lu 3:23). No such elaborate chronological precision is to be found elsewhere in the New Testament, and it comes fitly from him who claims it as the peculiar recommendation of his Gospel, that "he had traced down all things with precision from the very first" (Mt 1:3). Here evidently commences his proper narrative.<p>  Lu 3:1:<p>  Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius C&aelig;sar&#8212;not the fifteenth   from his full accession on the death of Augustus, but from the period when   he was associated with him in the government of the empire, three years   earlier, about the end of the year of Rome 779, or about four years before   the usual reckoning.<p>  Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea&#8212;His proper title was procurator,   but with more than the usual powers of that office. After holding it for   about ten years, he was summoned to Rome to answer to charges brought   against him; but ere he arrived, Tiberius died (A.D. 35), and soon after   miserable Pilate committed suicide.<p>  And Herod being tetrarch of Galilee&#8212;(See on [1210]Mr 6:14).<p>  and his brother Philip&#8212;a very different and very superior Philip to the   one whose name was Herod Philip, and whose wife, Herodias, went to live   with Herod Antipas (see on [1211]Mr 6:17).<p>  tetrarch of Itur&aelig;a&#8212;lying to the northeast of Palestine, and so called from   Itur or Jetur, Ishmael's son (1Ch 1:31), and anciently belonging to the   half-tribe of Manasseh.<p>  and of the region of Trachonitis&#8212;lying farther to the northeast, between   Iturea and Damascus; a rocky district infested by robbers, and committed   by Augustus to Herod the Great to keep in order.<p>  and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene&#8212;still more to the northeast; so   called, says Robinson, from Abila, eighteen miles from Damascus.<p>  Lu 3:2:<p>  Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests&#8212;The former, though deposed,   retained much of his influence, and, probably, as sagan or deputy,   exercised much of the power of the high priesthood along with Caiaphas,   his son-in-law (Joh 18:13; Ac 4:6). In David's time both Zadok and   Abiathar acted as high priests (2Sa 15:35), and it seems to have been the   fixed practice to have two (2Ki 25:18).<p>  the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness&#8212;Such   a way of speaking is never once used when speaking of Jesus, because He   was Himself The Living Word; whereas to all merely creature-messengers of   God, the word they spoke was a foreign element.

The Evangelist having given an account of the genealogy and birth of Christ; of the coming of the wise men from the east to him; of his preservation from Herod's bloody design against him, when all the infants at Bethlehem were slain; of the flight of Joseph with Mary and Jesus into Egypt, and of their return from thence, and settlement in Nazareth, where Christ continued till near the time of his baptism, and entrance on his public ministry; proceeds to give a brief relation of John, the harbinger and forerunner of Christ, and the administrator of baptism to him: and he describes him by his name John, in Hebrew  "Jochanan", which signifies "gracious", or "the grace of the Lord", or "the Lord has given grace"; which agrees with him, both as a good man, on whom the Lord had bestowed much grace, and as a preacher, whose business it was to publish the grace of God in Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-16.htm">Luke 16:16</a>. This name was given him by an angel before his conception, and by his parents at his birth, contrary to the mind of their relations and neighbours, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-13.htm">Luke 1:13</a>. He is called by some of the Jewish writers (m), John the "high priest"; his father Zacharias was a priest of the course of Abia, and he might succeed him therein, and be the head of that course, and for that reason be called a "high" or "chief priest"; as we find such were called, who were the principal among the priests, as were those who were chosen into the sanhedrim, or were the heads of these courses; and therefore we read of many chief priests, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-4.htm">Matthew 2:4</a>. From his being the first administrator of the ordinance of baptism, he is called John the Baptist; and this was a well known title and character of him. Josephus (n) calls him "John", who is surnamed , "the Baptist"; and Ben Gorion having spoken of him, says (o), this is that John who , "made", instituted, or practised "baptism"; and which, by the way, shows that this was not in use among the Jews before, but that John was the first practiser this way. He is described by his work and office as a preacher, he "came" or "was preaching" the doctrines of repentance and baptism; he published and declared that the kingdom of the Messiah was at hand, that he would quickly be revealed; and exhorted the people to believe on him, which should come after him. The place where he preached is mentioned, <p>in the wilderness of Judea; not that he preached to trees and to the wild beasts of the desert; for the wilderness of Judea was an habitable place, and had in it many cities, towns, and villages, in which we must suppose John came preaching, at least to persons which came out from thence. There were in Joshua's time six cities in this wilderness, namely Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah, and Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-61.htm">Joshua 15:61</a>. Mention is made in the Talmud (p) of this wilderness of Judea, as distinct from the land of Israel, when the doctors say, that <p>"they do not bring up small cattle in the land of Israel, but they bring them up , "in the wilderness which is in Judea".'' <p>The Jews have an observation (q) of many things coming from the wilderness; <p>"the law, they say, came from the wilderness; the tabernacle from the wilderness; the sanhedrim from the wilderness; the priesthood from the wilderness; the office of the Levites from the wilderness; the kingdom from the wilderness; and all the good gifts which God gave to Israel were from the wilderness.'' <p>So John came preaching here, and Christ was tempted here. The time of his appearance and preaching was in those days: not when Christ was newly born; or when the wise men paid their adoration to him; or when Herod slew the infants; or when he was just dead, and Archelaus reigned in his room; or when Christ first went to Nazareth; though it was whilst he dwelt there as a private person; but when John was about thirty years of age, and Christ was near unto it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-23.htm">Luke 3:23</a> an age in which ecclesiastical persons entered into service, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/4-3.htm">Numbers 4:3</a>.

Their custom of name-giving was, and still largely is, as follows: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> A Hebrew name is given to the child at circumcision. This is the holy name, and is used at all strictly religious ceremonies; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> when called to read the Law in the synagogue. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> Each person has a name whereby he is known among the Gentiles. This is, at the present time, the name used for business and social purposes, and may be either Hebrew or of some ether language. It is usually connected, either in sound or meaning, with the holy name. So Paul and Saul, Didymus and Thomas (for numerous examples, cf. Hamburger, 'Real-Encycl.,' vol. 2. pp. 831-836. Lowe, 'Memorbook of Nurnberg,' pp. 18-28: 1881). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> He may have, either as well as or instead of the last, a name which designates him more exactly <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) by mentioning his father or some other relation; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> Bartimaeus, Barsabbas (probably); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) by mentioning some physical, mental, moral, or other peculiarity; <span class="accented">e.g.</span> James the Little, Simon the Zealot, Barnabas (the son of exhortation), and, from non-biblical authors, James the Just, Rabbi Judah the Holy, Samuel the Astronomer, John the Shoemaker. The title "the Baptist" belongs, of course, to this last class, and must have been given him partly because of the number of persons whom he baptized, and still more because baptism was the visible and external aim and result of his preaching. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> What was there new in John's baptism? In considering this it must be remembered that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> dipping in water had been commanded in the Law as a religious rite to priests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/30-20.htm">Exodus 30:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/40-12.htm">Exodus 40:12</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-6.htm">Leviticus 8:6</a>) on their first consecration to their office, and on each occasion that they fulfilled the holiest parts of their duties (cf. the sprinklings of the Levites on their consecration, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/8-5.htm">Numbers 8:5-22</a>); and to all Israelites in cases of ceremonial uncleanness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-8.htm">Leviticus 14:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm">Numbers 19:13</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> It was very frequent among the Essenes (cf. especially the quotations from Josephus in Bishop Lightfoot, 'Colossians,' p. 171, edit. 1875). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(c)</span> It was, we can hardly doubt, already customary at the admission of proselytes. There are, indeed, no certain allusions in Josephus, Philo, and the older Targumists (cf. Leyrer, in Cremer, <span class="accented">s.v</span>. <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;</span>) to the baptism of proselytes properly so called; but (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;</span>) it is distinctly mentioned in the Mishna, and in such a way as to imply that it was an ancient custom, for the schools of both Shammai and Hillel assume it as a matter of course ('Pes,' 8:8); (<span class="greek">&#x3b2;</span>) as with books, so with customs, acceptance in two bodies originally one, as the Jewish and Christian Churches were, throws back the book or custom before the date of the separation. In other words, it is most improbable that Jews would only have begun to practise baptism at the admission of proselytes after it had been practised by a body which had separated from them. Jews would not be likely to adopt the distinguishing rite of Christians. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(d)</span> Thus already, before John's time, baptism was largely practised as a symbol of purification from sin and of entrance on a new and holier life. Wherein, then, lay the distinguishing feature of John's baptism? Apparently in its being extended to all Israelites, without their having any personal ceremonial hindrance, and more particularly in the special aim and purpose to which it now referred. <span class="accented">It signified the entrance upon a new life of expectation of Messiah.</span> As of old, the nation had accepted the offer of God's kingdom, and, having washed their garments (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-10.htm">Exodus 19:10, 14</a>), had been sprinkled with blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-8.htm">Exodus 24:8</a>), so now, when this kingdom, was about to be more fully manifested, not the nation, indeed, considered as a whole, but (in harmony with the individualization of the gospel) those persons who responded to the invitation, came forward and publicly renounced their sins and professed their expectation of the kingdom (Edersheim, 'Life,' etc., 1:274). It is thus easy to account for the deep and widespread impression made by John the Baptist  (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-25.htm">Acts 18:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-3.htm">Acts 19:3</a>), and for the important position that he holds in summaries of the origins of Christianity. John's baptism was treated by our Lord himself as the first stage in his earthly ministry, which culminated in the gift of the Holy Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-5.htm">Acts 1:5</a>), and naturally by the apostles as the historical introduction to the teaching and work of Messiah. Josephus's account of John the Baptist is well known, but too interesting to be omitted. "Now, some of the Jews thought that the destruction of Herod's army [by Aretas] came from God, and that very justly, as a punishment of what he did against John that was called the Baptist. For Herod had had him put to death, though he was a good man, and commanded the Jews to exercise virtue both as to righteousness towards one another and piety towards God, and so to come to baptism; for baptism would be acceptable to God, if they made use of it, not in order to expiate some sins, but for the purification of the body, provided that the soul was thoroughly purified beforehand by righteousness. Now, as many flocked to him, for they were greatly moved by hearing his words, Herod, fearing that the great influence John had over the people might lead to some rebellion (for the people seemed ready to do anything he should advise), thought it far best, by putting him to death, to prevent any mischief he might cause, and not bring himself into difficulties by sparing a man who might make him repent of his leniency when it should he too late. Accordingly, he was sent a prisoner, in consequence of Herod's suspicious temper, to Machaerus, the castle I before mentioned, and was there put to death. So the Jews had an opinion that the destruction of this army was sent as a punishment upon Herod, and was a mark of God's displeasure against him" ('Ant,' 18:5. 2, Shilleto's Whiston). Observe that <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Josephus confirms the Gospel account of the extent of John's influence over his countrymen; but <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> attributes his imprisonment and death to a political, not a moral, cause. It is quite possible, on the one hand, that political reasons were not altogether wanting; and, on the other, that Josephus was ignorant of the more personal and stronger motive of Herod's action. <span class="cmt_word">Preaching</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>).

By this term is not necessarily meant absolute desert, but "des lieux pen habites ou non cultives" (Neubauer, 'Geogr. du Talm.,' p. 52: 1868). The very place in which John preached was part of the symbolism of his whole life. The expectation of Messiah must lead to separation, but separation deeper than that of those who called themselves the "separated" (Pharisees). <span class="cmt_word">Of</span> <span class="cmt_word">Judea</span>.

It seems that, while different parts of the rugged district from Jericho southwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-1.htm">Joshua 16:1</a>), immediately on the west and north of the Dead Sea, had their distinctive titles - the wilderness of Siph (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm">1 Samuel 23:14, 15</a>), of Maon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-24.htm">1 Samuel 23:24</a>), of Engedi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-1.htm">1 Samuel 24:1</a>), of Jeruel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-16.htm">2 Chronicles 20:16</a>), of Tekoa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-20.htm">2 Chronicles 20:20</a>) - the whole district was, as belonging to the tribe and even more certainly to the kingdom and province of Judah, known by the name of "the wilderness of Judaea." According to tradition, John was now preaching near Jericho. We find him soon after this at Bethany beyond Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-28.htm">John 1:28</a>), and later still at tenon, near Salim, in, or on the borders of, Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-23.htm">John 3:23</a>)." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>In those days<p>The phrase is indefinite, but always points back to a preceding date; in this case to the date of the settlement of the family at Nazareth.

Hepworth Dixon ("The Holy Land") says, "Even in the wilderness nature is not so stern as man.
