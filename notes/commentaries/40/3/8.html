The thought is, however, “by coming to the baptism you profess repentance; bring forth, therefore, fruit <span class= "ital">worthy of repentance—i.e.,</span> of a changed heart and will.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:">Matthew 3:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">Bring forth, therefore, fruits meet for repentance </span>— That is, a change of temper and behaviour, answerable thereto; <span class="ital">forsake, </span>as well as <span class="ital">confess, </span>your sins, and let the integrity, regularity, holiness, and usefulness of your lives, manifest the sincerity of your repentance.

Let it be observed, further, that as the original word, <span class="greekheb">μετανοια</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">repentance, </span>properly signifies <span class="ital">a change of mind, </span>from the approbation and love of sin to an aversion and hatred to it, in consequence of a deep conviction of its evil nature and destructive tendency; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm" title="And saying, Repent you: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 3:2</a>;) so, wherever this is, there will, of course, be an entire reformation of life, a <span class="ital">ceasing to do evil, </span>in all respects, according to the knowledge and ability of the penitent, and <span class="ital">a learning to do well. </span>Hence it is styled <span class="ital">repentance from dead works, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-1.htm" title="Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,">Hebrews 6:1</a>; and <span class="ital">repentance unto salvation not to be repented of, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm" title="For godly sorrow works repentance to salvation not to be repented of: but the sorrow of the world works death.">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>; that is, such as is not reversed by any voluntary returning or relapsing into our former sins. And, seeing God is unchangeably holy, and must for ever hate all sin with a perfect hatred, it is certain, from his very nature, that he cannot be reconciled to or have communion with the sinner, till a change be wrought in his spirit and conduct, and he cease from the commission of known iniquity. For a change there must be in God or man; and, since God’s nature is immutable, and it cannot be in him, it must of necessity be in man. Now it is evident, both from reason and experience, that confession of sins, a present sorrow for them, and displeasure against them, with a warm resolution to forsake them, are by no means always attended with this change, and, therefore, that these alone cannot be <span class="ital">fruits meet for repentance. </span>And O, how necessary was this admonition for the men of that age, who placed their repentance, as Dr. Lightfoot observes, in a mere verbal confession of their sins; and is it not equally necessary for too many of our own age?<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-12 To make application to the souls of the hearers, is the life of preaching; so it was of John's preaching. The Pharisees laid their chief stress on outward observances, neglecting the weightier matters of the moral law, and the spiritual meaning of their legal ceremonies. Others of them were detestable hypocrites, making their pretences to holiness a cloak for iniquity. The Sadducees ran into the opposite extreme, denying the existence of spirits, and a future state. They were the scornful infidels of that time and country. There is a wrath to come. It is the great concern of every one to flee from that wrath. God, who delights not in our ruin, has warned us; he warns by the written word, by ministers, by conscience. And those are not worthy of the name of penitents, or their privileges, who say they are sorry for their sins, yet persist in them. It becomes penitents to be humble and low in their own eyes, to be thankful for the least mercy, patient under the greatest affliction, to be watchful against all appearances of sin, to abound in every duty, and to be charitable in judging others. Here is a word of caution, not to trust in outward privileges. There is a great deal which carnal hearts are apt to say within themselves, to put aside the convincing, commanding power of the word of God. Multitudes, by resting in the honours and mere advantages of their being members of an outward church, come short of heaven. Here is a word of terror to the careless and secure. Our corrupt hearts cannot be made to produce good fruit, unless the regenerating Spirit of Christ graft the good word of God upon them. And every tree, however high in gifts and honours, however green in outward professions and performances, if it bring not forth good fruit, the fruits meet for repentance, is hewn down and cast into the fire of God's wrath, the fittest place for barren trees: what else are they good for? If not fit for fruit, they are fit for fuel. John shows the design and intention of Christ's appearing, which they were now speedily to expect. No outward forms can make us clean. No ordinances, by whomsoever administered, or after whatever mode, can supply the want of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and of fire. The purifying and cleansing power of the Holy Spirit alone can produce that purity of heart, and those holy affections, which accompany salvation. It is Christ who baptizes with the Holy Ghost. This he did in the extraordinary gifts of the Spirit sent upon the apostles, Ac 2:4. This he does in the graces and comforts of the Spirit, given to those that ask him, Lu 11:13; Joh 7:38,39; see Ac 11:16. Observe here, the outward church is Christ's floor, Isa 21:10. True believers are as wheat, substantial, useful, and valuable; hypocrites are as chaff, light and empty, useless and worthless, carried about with every wind; these are mixed, good and bad, in the same outward communion. There is a day coming when the wheat and chaff shall be separated. The last judgment will be the distinguishing day, when saints and sinners shall be parted for ever. In heaven the saints are brought together, and no longer scattered; they are safe, and no longer exposed; separated from corrupt neighbours without, and corrupt affections within, and there is no chaff among them. Hell is the unquenchable fire, which will certainly be the portion and punishment of hypocrites and unbelievers. Here life and death, good and evil, are set before us: according as we now are in the field, we shall be then in the floor.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bring forth therefore fruits ... - That is, the proper fruits of reformation; the proper evidence that you are sincere.

Those which follow upon evangelical repentance are such as are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-11.htm">2 Corinthians 7:11</a>. Now let it be observed, that John insisted upon repentance, and a good conversation, attesting the truth of it as necessary prerequisites to the ordinance of baptism; and so Peter first urged repentance; and then proposed baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a> from whence one should think it may be rationally and strongly concluded, that none but truly repenting sinners, and such who have given proofs that they are so, are to be admitted to this ordinance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:</span><p>(3) True repentance is an inward thing which has its seat in the mind and heart.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:">Matthew 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οὖν</span>] Deduction from what precedes. <span class="ital">In your impenitent condition you cannot escape from the wrath; proceed then to exhibit that morality of conduct which is appropriate to the change of mind as its result</span>.
