In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That it might be fulfilled - This is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2-3</a>.

The same general idea underlies our present verses, but although each evangelist appears to have used the same words as a basis, he has worked them out in his own characteristic way. For while both writers contrast our Lord's treatment of the multitudes and his treatment of the disciples in the matter of parables, St. Mark barely alludes to his using them as a judicial punishment upon the people, and St. Matthew merely hints here at the fact that Christ explained them to his disciples (see further, ver. 35<span class="accented">b</span>, note). It will be noticed that our verses have much in common with the thought of ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span> It seems just possible that both paragraphs had one common nucleus from which they were each developed. But according to existing evidence, ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>, and the parallel passages in Mark and Luke serve to introduce explanatory matter to the disciples, and our present verses with the parallel in Mark to close a series of parables. <span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 34</span> - <span class="cmt_word">All these things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x1fe6;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>)<span class="accented">.
