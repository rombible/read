He found the word “parable” at the opening of a Psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" title="I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:">Psalm 78:2</a>). The Psalm itself was in no sense predictive, but simply an historical survey of God’s dealings with Israel from the days of the Exodus to those of David. But the occurrence of the word was enough for him. Here was One whose form of teaching answered to that which the Psalmist had described, who might claim the Psalmist’s words as His own; and excluding, as he did, the idea of chance from all such coincidences, he could use even here the familiar formula, “that it might be fulfilled.”<p>A remarkable various-reading gives, “by Esaias the prophet.” It is found in the Sinaitic MS., and had been used before the time of Jerome by a heathen writer (Porphyry) as a proof of St. Matthew’s ignorance. Old as it is, however, there is no reason for receiving it as the original reading. The mistake was probably that of a transcriber, misled by the word “prophet,” and writing the name after the precedent of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/8-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bore our sicknesses.">Matthew 8:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-17.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the prophet, saying,">Matthew 12:17</a>. If the mistake had been St. Matthew’s, it would stand on the same footing as the substitution of Jeremiah for Zechariah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm" title="Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of Israel did value;">Matthew 27:9</a>. The Psalm is assigned by the superscription to the authorship of Asaph.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:31-35 The scope of the parable of the seed sown, is to show that the beginnings of the gospel would be small, but its latter end would greatly increase; in this way the work of grace in the heart, the kingdom of God within us, would be carried on. In the soul where grace truly is, it will grow really; though perhaps at first not to be discerned, it will at last come to great strength and usefulness. The preaching of the gospel works like leaven in the hearts of those who receive it. The leaven works certainly, so does the word, yet gradually. It works silently, and without being seen, Mr 4:26-29, yet strongly; without noise, for so is the way of the Spirit, but without fail. Thus it was in the world. The apostles, by preaching the gospel, hid a handful of leaven in the great mass of mankind. It was made powerful by the Spirit of the Lord of hosts, who works, and none can hinder. Thus it is in the heart. When the gospel comes into the soul, it works a thorough change; it spreads itself into all the powers and faculties of the soul, and alters the property even of the members of the body, Ro 6:13. From these parables we are taught to expect a gradual progress; therefore let us inquire, Are we growing in grace? and in holy principles and habits?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That it might be fulfilled - This is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2-3</a>. The sense, and not the very words of the Psalm, are given. Christ taught, as did that prophet - Asaph - in parables.

Christ spake all the aforementioned things to the multitude, and also to his disciples, in parables, dark sayings, covering Divine and spiritual truths with fit and proper similitudes; and at this time he delivered himself wholly in this manner to them, though at other times he spake more plainly. He gave us the reason before; and by this way of speaking also he made his own disciples more diligent to attend to what they heard, and more inquisitive after the true sense and meaning of it. And thus, saith the evangelist, that which was spoken by the prophet, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" title="I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:">Psalm 78:2</a></span>, was also fulfilled in Christ: not that the psalmist, whether David or Asaph, did there prophesy concerning Christ, for plainly the psalmist intended to relate the history of God’s dealing with the Jews, and their behaviour toward him. Nor was it fulfilled as the type in the antitype, but as a thing of the same nature was done.

In the original Hebrew it is expressly said במשׁל, not in parables, but in a song of proverbs, the contents of which, however, though historical from beginning to end, “latentes rerum Messiae figuras continebat” (Grotius), and a similar instance of which we meet with afterwards in the discourse of Stephen. Accordingly, the prophet, instructing and warning as he does by means of a typical use of history, is looked upon by the evangelist as the type of Christ speaking in parabolic narratives, and through this medium unfolding the mysteries of the completed theocracy. In Christ he finds realized what the prophet says with reference to himself: <span class="greekheb">ἀνοίξω</span>, etc., and <span class="greekheb">ἑρεύξομαι</span>, etc., the antitypical fulfillment, though it must be granted that in doing so it is undoubtedly the expression <span class="greekheb">ἐν παραβολαῖς</span> on which he makes the whole thing to turn, but that, availing himself of a freedom acknowledged to be legitimate in the use of types, he has employed that expression in a special sense, and one that is foreign to the original Hebrew.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/13.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-35.htm" title="That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.">Matthew 13:35</a>. rophetic citation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" title="I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:">Psalm 78:2</a>, suggested by <span class="greekheb">παραβολαῖς</span> in Sept[83], second clause, free translation from Hebrew.—<span class="greekheb">ἐρεύξομαι</span> in Sept[84] for <span class="greekheb">הּבִּיעַ</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/19-2.htm" title="Day to day utters speech, and night to night shows knowledge.">Psalm 19:2</a>, etc. (not in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm" title="I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:">Psalm 78:2</a>), a poetic word in Ionic form, bearing strong, coarse meaning; used in softened sense in Hellenistic Greek.

Dr. Herr ('Appendix') writes, "It is difficult not to think <span class="greek">&#x1f28;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;</span> genuine. There was a strong temptation to omit it (cf. 27:9; Mc. Mark 1:2); and, though its insertion might be accounted for by an impulse to supply the name of the best known prophet, the evidence of the actual operation of such an impulse is much more trifling than might have been anticipated .... The erroneous introduction of Isaiah's name is limited to two passages, and in each case to a single Latin manuscript." If it be genuine, it is a parallel case to the reading "Jeremiah" instead of "Zechariah" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>, for which no satisfactory explanation has yet been suggested. A simple error of memory (cf. Alford) on the part of one who shows himself so well acquainted with Hebrew customs and modes of thought as our evangelist does, is perhaps the most improbable of all solutions. Possibly, just as there were summaries of legal maxims current in our Lord's time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-21.htm">Matthew 5:21</a>, note), so there were in Hebrew-Christian circles well known sets of quotations from the Old Testament, which were not expressly divided one from another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-10.htm">Romans 3:10-18</a>), and which were ferreted <span class="accented">to under the name of the author of the best known passage.</span> (Observe that this would distinguish these summaries from liturgical quotations.) Thus Zechariah's mention of the potter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-13.htm">Zechariah 11:13</a>) was placed in connexion with Jeremiah's visit to the potter's house, and with his warning of the possible rejection of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-1.htm">Jeremiah 18:1-6</a>; cf. 19:1-11); cf. further Pusey's remarks on the passage in Zechariah, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a> (or perhaps 1-3), where Israel is bid listen to the lessons derived from their ancestors' behaviour, with the warning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9, 10</a> (cf. our vers. 34, 35 with ver. 14). We have an example of a similar connexion of passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-2.htm">Mark 1:2, 3</a>, where <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> is closely joined to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-3.htm">Isaiah 40:3</a>. Observe that if St. Mark had copied his source (<span class="accented">ex hypothesi</span>) to the end of the quotation from Malachi, and for some reason omitted the next quotation, he might very easily have still retained the name "Isaiah" with which he introduces his double quotation. Had he done so, we should have had another parallel to our present verse and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-9.htm">Matthew 27:9</a>. <span class="accented">The prophet.</span> If "Isaiah" be not genuine, this refers to "Asaph the seer" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-30.htm">2 Chronicles 29:30</a>), who was the recognized author of the psalm.

But the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5e0;&#x5d9;&#x20;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;&#x5dd;</span> (<span class="accented">i.e.</span> "from of old") hardly, in the context of the psalm, refers further back than the be ginning of the national history of Israel, when the Israelites came out of Egypt. "Asaph...  here recounts to the people their history from that Egyptaeo-Sinaitic age of yore to which Israel's national indepen dence and specific position in relation to the rest of the world goes back He will set forth the history of the fathers after the manner of a parable and riddle, so that it may become as a parable, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> a didactic history, and its events as marks of interrogation and nota benes to the present age" (Delitzsch). What, however, is the exact connexion of thought in the gospel between the passage as it stands, and its context? The first clause evidently corresponds in meaning to ver. 34; Christ fulfils in a fresh sense the expression of the psalmist by speaking in parables (<span class="accented">vide infra</span>). But the second clause brings in a different thought, not found, save very indirectly, in ver. 34, namely, that Christ utters things that be fore were always hidden. What does the evangelist mean by this second clause? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> Truths never before revealed have now been revealed by Christ's parables, especially by those two which have just been related. For in these it has been affirmed that outsiders, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> those belonging to other nations than the Jewish nation, shall seek the protection of the kingdom of heaven, and also that the whole world, including, therefore, these Gentile nations, shall become permeated with its principles. It may well be thought that the clause refers to the announcement of these great truths. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> This interpretation, however, if taken alone, is not enough. For the evangelist is not speaking of Christ revealing truths to men generally. On the contrary, he says that Christ does not reveal them to the multi tudes, but to his disciples (cf. ver. 10, <span class="accented">sqq.</span>) - a contrast which the emphatic language of ver. 34 (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>) would probably suggest, even though it is not expressly mentioned. It is, therefore, likely that it was this latter fact to which the evangelist specially wished to refer by his quotation of the second clause. Hence, to make his meaning clearer, he has modified its language. As he quotes it, not merely "enigmatical sayings," but "things hidden" (and that from the foundation of the world) are uttered by Christ; but these are now no longer "hidden" to those to whom he speaks them. This complete meaning of the clause - revelation to his disciples of truths before hidden - corresponds to the idea of <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> in ver. 11 (where see note) and in St. Paul (cf. especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm">Romans 16:25</a>), and is merely another side of St. Mark's phrase, "Privately to his own disciples he expounded all things" (cf. <span class="accented">supra</span>, vers. 16, 17). It is also possible that <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>, which is not merely negative, so as to mean "unrevealed," but implies a positive concealment, includes a reference to the thought of <span class="greek">&#x1f14;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#x3c8;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm">Matthew 11:25</a>, that God purposely hid these truths from those who were morally unfit to receive them. These, indeed, belonged in general to the times before Christ came, but also "the multitudes" came under this category. If it be asked - What is the relation of the quotation in its context here to the verse in its original context? the easiest answer is that it is only superficial, that the "accidental" employment by the psalmist of the word "parable" was the only reason why the evangelist made the quotation. Yet it may not be quite so; for there was a real similarity between the psalmist teaching his contemporaries by history and Christ teaching his contemporaries by truths couched in narrative form. May we not go even further, and say that in both cases the message was, generally speaking, refused, though in both a remnant of those who heard it were saved (cf also <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9-13</a>; <span class="accented">vide supra</span>)<span class="accented">?</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/13.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I will utter (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>The verb, in which the sound corresponds to the sense (ereuxoma,), means originally to belch, to disgorge. Homer uses it of the sea surging against the shore ("Iliad," xvii., 265). Pindar of the eruption of Aetna ("Pyth.," i., 40). There seems to lie in the word a sense of full, impassioned utterance, as of a prophet.<p>From the foundation (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;)<p>"It is assumed by the Psalmsist.(<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-2.htm">Psalm 78:2</a>) that there was a hidden meaning in God's ancient dealings with his people. A typical, archetypical, and prefigurative element ran through the whole. The history of the dealings is one long Old Testament parable. Things long kept secret, and that were hidden indeed in the depths of the divine mind from before the foundation of the world, were involved in these dealings. And hence the evangelist wisely sees, in the parabolic teaching of our Lord, a real culmination of the older parabolic teaching of the Psalmsist. The culmination was divinely intended, and hence the expression that it might be fulfilled" (Morison on Matthew). </body></html>
