Moreover, it is observable that they did not go into Galilee till above eight days after Christ’s resurrection, for Christ appeared to them at Jerusalem eight days after, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-19.htm" title="Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews, came Jesus and stood in the middle, and said to them, Peace be to you.">John 20:19</a>; and when they went, doubtless, they went not alone, but the curiosity of those that were with them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-9.htm" title="And returned from the sepulcher, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.">Luke 24:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-33.htm" title="And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,">Luke 24:33</a>, would probably move them to go to the place where he had appointed to be seen. It is true, the evangelist does not say that there were more present at this appearance than the eleven; nevertheless, the circumstances of the case direct us to believe that it had many witnesses. “This appearance was known beforehand; the place where it was to happen was pointed out by Jesus himself; and it was represented in such a light as if the appearances which were to take place before it were of small importance in comparison of it. The report, therefore, of his being to appear in Galilee, must have spread abroad, and brought many to the place at the appointed time. In short, it is reasonable to think that most of the disciples now enjoyed the happiness of beholding personally their Master raised from the dead. What confirms this supposition is, that Paul says expressly, Jesus, after his resurrection, <span class="ital">was seen of above five hundred brethren at once, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-6.htm" title="And it may be that I will abide, yes, and winter with you, that you may bring me on my journey wherever I go.">1 Corinthians 16:6</a>, for that number of witnesses mentioned by Paul agrees better to the appearance on the mountain in Galilee described by Matthew than to any other. Galilee having been the principal scene of Christ’s ministry, the greatest part of his followers lived there; for which reason he chose to make what may be called his most solemn and public appearance after his resurrection on a mountain in that country; an appearance to which, as we have seen, a general meeting of all his disciples was summoned, not only by the angels who attended his resurrection, but by our Lord himself, the very day on which he arose.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:16-20 This evangelist passes over other appearances of Christ, recorded by Luke and John, and hastens to the most solemn; one appointed before his death, and after his resurrection. All that see the Lord Jesus with an eye of faith, will worship him. Yet the faith of the sincere may be very weak and wavering. But Christ gave such convincing proofs of his resurrection, as made their faith to triumph over doubts. He now solemnly commissioned the apostles and his ministers to go forth among all nations. The salvation they were to preach, is a common salvation; whoever will, let him come, and take the benefit; all are welcome to Christ Jesus. Christianity is the religion of a sinner who applies for salvation from deserved wrath and from sin; he applies to the mercy of the Father, through the atonement of the incarnate Son, and by the sanctification of the Holy Spirit, and gives up himself to be the worshipper and servant of God, as the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, three Persons but one God, in all his ordinances and commandments. Baptism is an outward sign of that inward washing, or sanctification of the Spirit, which seals and evidences the believer's justification. Let us examine ourselves, whether we really possess the inward and spiritual grace of a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, by which those who were the children of wrath become the children of God. Believers shall have the constant presence of their Lord always; all days, every day. There is no day, no hour of the day, in which our Lord Jesus is not present with his churches and with his ministers; if there were, in that day, that hour, they would be undone. The God of Israel, the Saviour, is sometimes a God that hideth himself, but never a God at a distance. To these precious words Amen is added. Even so, Lord Jesus, be thou with us and all thy people; cause thy face to shine upon us, that thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among all nations.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then the eleven disciples - Judas was dead, leaving but eleven of the original number of the apostles.<p>Into a mountain where Jesus lead appointed them - This "appointment" is recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>. On what particular mountain this was is not known. It is probable that Jesus, when he made the appointment, specified the place, which has been omitted by the evangelists. Matthew has omitted many appearances which Jesus made to his disciples which have been recorded by Luke, John, and Paul.

Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee&#8212;but certainly not before the second week after the resurrection, and probably somewhat later.<p>into a mountain where Jesus had appointed them&#8212;It should have been rendered "the mountain," meaning some certain mountain which He had named to them&#8212;probably the night before He suffered, when He said, "After I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee" (Mt 26:32; Mr 14:28). What it was can only be conjectured; but of the two between which opinions are divided&#8212;the Mount of the Beatitudes or Mount Tabor&#8212;the former is much the more probable, from its nearness to the Sea of Tiberias, where last before this the Narrative tells us that He met and dined with seven of them. (Joh 21:1, &c.). That the interview here recorded was the same as that referred to in one place only&#8212;1Co 15:6&#8212;when "He was seen of above five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remained unto that day, though some were fallen asleep," is now the opinion of the ablest students of the evangelical history. Nothing can account for such a number as five hundred assembling at one spot but the expectation of some promised manifestation of their risen Lord: and the promise before His resurrection, twice repeated after it, best explains this immense gathering.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-17.htm" title="And when they saw him, they worshipped him: but some doubted.">Matthew 28:17</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/28.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the eleven disciples,....

As the sacred form appeared on the familiar mountain side they threw themselves on the ground, doing homage to their Lord and God. But some doubted still. Then He drew more near and spake.

The number "eleven" shows the loss of one of the sacred college, whose complement was not filled up till just before Pentecost (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-15.htm">Acts 1:15-26</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Went away into Galilee.</span> St. Matthew takes pains to show the exact fulfilment of Christ's very special injunction and promise concerning Galilee (see vers. 7, 10, and notes there, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-32.htm">Matthew 26:32</a>). The evangelist's object being to set forth Christ in his character as King and Lawgiver, he puts aside all other incidents in order to give prominence to this appearance, where Jesus announces his supreme authority (ver. 18), gives the commission to his apostles, and promises his perpetual presence (vers. 19, 20). <span class="cmt_word">Into a mountain</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, <span class="accented">the mountain</span>)<span class="accented">, <span class="cmt_word"></span>where</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span> instead of <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">Jesus had appointed them</span>. We do not know the locality intended, though it must have been some spot familiar to the disciples, and was probably plainly  designated at the time when Christ appointed the meeting. Some have fixed on Tabor as the scene of this revelation, others on the Mount of Beatitudes; but where nothing is stated it is best to lay aside conjecture and accept the designed indefiniteness. Many commentators have determined that this appearance on the Galilaean mountain was that mentioned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-6.htm">1 Corinthians 15:6</a>), as manifested to five hundred brethren at once. This is a mere conjecture, probable, but not certain. If it was the case, we must consider that St. Matthew singles out the eleven apostles as the most eminent among the company, and those to whom the Lord specially addressed the commission which he mentions. Of the five hundred brethren, St. Paul, writing some twenty years or more after this time, testifies that the greater number were still alive, only some having "fallen asleep." There never was, indeed, any historical fact the authenticity of which was more remarkably and irrefragably certified than the resurrection of Christ. </body></html>
