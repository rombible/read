It is significant that the period of her sufferings coincided with the age of the ruler’s daughter. His sorrow was sudden after twelve years of joyful hope; hers had brought with it, through twelve long years, the sickness of hope deferred. St. Mark and St. Luke add (though in the latter some MSS. omit the words) that she “had spent all her substance on physicians, and was nothing bettered, but rather grew worse;” and the former states (what is, of course, obvious) that she came because she had “heard of the things concerning Jesus.”<p><span class= "bld">Touched the hem of his garment.</span>—The incidental notice is interesting as making up, together with <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/14-36.htm" title="And sought him that they might only touch the hem of his garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.">Matthew 14:36</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/19-23.htm" title="Then the soldiers, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also his coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.">John 19:23</a>, all that we know as to our Lord’s outward garb. There was first, nearest the body, the coat or tunic (<span class= "greekheb">χίτων</span>) without seam, woven from the top throughout; then, over that, the garment or cloak (<span class= "greekheb">ίμάτιον</span>)<span class= "ital">,</span> flowing loosely after the manner of the East; and this had its “border or fringe,” probably of a bright blue mingled with white, that on which the scribes and Pharisees laid stress as being in accordance with the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put on the fringe of the borders a ribbon of blue:">Numbers 15:38</a>), and which they wore, therefore, of an ostentatious width (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-5.htm" title="But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their garments,">Matthew 23:5</a>). Later tradition defined the very number of the threads or tassels of the fringe, so that they might represent the 613 precepts of the Law.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/9.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/9-20.htm" title="And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment:...">Matthew 9:20-22</a></span>. <span class="ital">And, behold, a woman which was diseased </span>— According to the circumstances of her disease, as mentioned by Mark and Luke, it was incurable by any human power, and she herself knew it to be so, having been afflicted with it for twelve years, and tried the skill of many physicians, probably of all that were of note in the country; and having <span class="ital">spent all that she had upon them, </span>and yet <span class="ital">could not be healed by any, </span>nay, nor relieved in any measure; for, after all their endeavours to remove her complaint, she was <span class="ital">nothing bettered, </span>but rather <span class="ital">grew worse. </span>But having heard of Jesus, and the wonderful cures which he had wrought, she believed that his power was sufficient to heal her also. Being ashamed, however, publicly to mention her case, and learning that many had before been healed by touching him, she, out of bashfulness and humility, <span class="ital">came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment </span>— The woman’s distemper being of such a nature as to render those unclean whom she touched, perhaps she durst not lay her hand on the person of so great a prophet, nor touch any part of his garment but its hem; to touch which, however, she believed was sufficient to effect the cure. <span class="ital">For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I shall be whole </span>— Thus showing, as well the strength of her faith, as the greatness of her humility; <span class="ital">and straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up, </span>namely, by the invisible power which Christ secretly exerted, for he well knew both what was passing in her mind, and what she did. <span class="ital">And Jesus turned him about,</span> &c. — It was necessary that the ministry of the Son of God should be rendered illustrious by all kinds of miracles, and that the whole people of the country where he lived should have the highest idea and the firmest persuasion of his power. And it was for advancing these great ends, that the success of this woman’s attempt equalled the faith by which she was influenced. And for the same reasons, Jesus would by no means allow her faith to remain unnoticed and unapplauded. Therefore, immediately turning about in the crowd, he asked, says St. Mark, <span class="ital">Who touched my clothes? </span>This he did, that the woman might be brought to make a confession of the whole matter; that the power of her faith, and the greatness of the cure, might be made manifest, to the glory of God and for the instruction of others; and he might have an occasion given him of encouraging and comforting her, that she might persevere in the exercise of similar humility and faith, during the rest of her life. <span class="ital">And when he saw her </span>— When, in consequence of his making this inquiry, she came forward toward him, and confessed what she had done, <span class="ital">he said, </span>in a most gentle and condescending manner, <span class="ital">Daughter, be of good comfort </span>— Gr. <span class="greekheb">θαρσει</span>, <span class="ital">take courage: thy faith hath made thee whole — </span>Thou hast received a cure through thy faith in my power and goodness: hold fast that faith therefore unto the end. Doubtless she was struck with fear when Jesus turned and looked upon her, lest she should have offended him by touching his garment privately; and the more so because she was unclean according to the law. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-25.htm" title="And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.">Leviticus 15:25</a>. Hence Mark says that she came forward <span class="ital">fearing and trembling, knowing what was done in her, and fell down before him. And the woman was made whole from that hour </span>— “This incidental miracle appears very grand, when the relation it bears to the principal one is considered. Jesus is going to give a specimen of that almighty power, by which the resurrection of all men to immortality shall be effected at the last day; and behold, virtue, little inferior to that which is capable of raising the dead to life, issues from him through his garment, and heals a very obstinate disease, which, having baffled the powers of medicine for twelve years, had remained absolutely incurable, till the presence of Jesus, who is the resurrection and the life, chased it away. The cure, though complete, was performed in an instant, and the woman knew it by the immediate ease which she felt, by the return of her strength, by the cheerfulness of her spirits, and by all the other agreeable sensations which accompany sudden changes from painful diseases to perfect health. This Mark expresses shortly and elegantly, (<span class="greekheb">Εγνω τω σωματι</span>,) <span class="ital">She felt in her body that she was healed of that plague.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:18-26 The death of our relations should drive us to Christ, who is our life. And it is high honour to the greatest rulers to attend on the Lord Jesus; and those who would receive mercy from Christ, must honour him. The variety of methods Christ took in working his miracles, perhaps was because of the different frames and tempers of mind, which those were in who came to him, and which He who searches the heart perfectly knew. A poor woman applied herself to Christ, and received mercy from him by the way. If we do but touch, as it were, the hem of Christ's garment by living faith, our worst evils will be healed; there is no other real cure, nor need we fear his knowing things which are a grief and burden to us, but which we would not tell to any earthly friend. When Christ entered the ruler's house, he said, Give place. Sometimes, when the sorrow of the world prevails, it is difficult for Christ and his comforts to enter. The ruler's daughter was really dead, but not so to Christ. The death of the righteous is in a special manner to be looked on as only a sleep. The words and works of Christ may not at first be understood, yet they are not therefore to be despised. The people were put forth. Scorners who laugh at what they do not understand, are not proper witnesses of the wonderful works of Christ. Dead souls are not raised to spiritual life, unless Christ take them by the hand: it is done in the day of his power. If this single instance of Christ's raising one newly dead so increased his fame, what will be his glory when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice, and come forth; those that have done good to the resurrection of life, and those that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And, behold, a woman ... - This disease was by the Jews reckoned unclean <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-25.htm">Leviticus 15:25</a>, and the woman was therefore unwilling to make personal application to Jesus, or even to touch his person.

This affair happened in the streets of Capernaum, as Christ was going from the house of Matthew the publican, to the house of Jairus the ruler of the synagogue, which were both in this city. This poor woman's case was a very distressed one; she had been attended <p>with an issue of blood twelve years; it was an uncommon flux of a long standing, was inveterate, and become incurable; though she had not been negligent of herself, but had made use of means, applied herself to regular physicians, had took many a disagreeable medicine, and had spent all her substance in this way; but instead of being better, was worse, and was now given up by them, as past all cure. This woman might be truly called , (x) "the greater profluvious woman", in the language of the doctors; for if one that had a flux but three days was called so, much more one that had had it twelve years. She having heard of Jesus, and his miraculous cures, had faith given her to believe, that she also should receive one from him; wherefore she <p>came behind him, through modesty, being ashamed to come before him, and tell him her case, especially before so many people; and fearing lest if her case was known, she should be thrust away, if not by Christ, yet by the company; she being according to the law an unclean person, and unfit for society: <p>and touched the hem of his garment; which was the  or "fringes", the Jews were obliged to wear upon the borders of their garments, and on it a ribband of blue; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-38.htm">Numbers 15:38</a> in both which places Onkelos uses the word  the same with   used here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-56.htm">Mark 6:56</a> and rendered "hem". The Jews placed much sanctity in the wear and use of these fringes; and the Pharisees, who pretended to more holiness than others, enlarged them beyond their common size; but it was not on account of any peculiar holiness in this part of Christ's garment, that induced this poor woman to touch it; but this being behind him, and more easy to be come at, she therefore laid hold on it; for it was his garment, any part of it she concluded, if she could but touch, she should have a cure. However, we learn from hence, that Christ complied with the rites of the ceremonial law in apparel, as well as in other things. <p>(x) Ib. Issure Bia, c. 6. sect. 7, 8. &amp; in Misn.
