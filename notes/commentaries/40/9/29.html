Others might have their faith strengthened by the look of sympathy and conscious power which they saw in the face of the Healer. From that influence they were shut out, and for them therefore its absence was supplied by acts which they would naturally connect with the purpose to heal them. (Comp. the later instances in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-34.htm" title="So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.">Matthew 20:34</a>; ‘<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-6.htm" title="When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay,">John 9:6</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/9.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>9:27-31 At this time the Jews expected Messiah would appear; these blind men knew and proclaimed in the streets of Capernaum that he was come, and that Jesus was he. Those who, by the providence of God, have lost their bodily sight, may, by the grace of God, have the eyes of their understanding fully enlightened. And whatever our wants and burdens are, we need no more for supply and support, than to share in the mercy of our Lord Jesus. In Christ is enough for all. They followed him crying aloud. He would try their faith, and would teach us always to pray, and not to faint, though the answer does not come at once. They followed Christ, and followed him crying; but the great question is, Do ye believe? Nature may make us earnest, but it is only grace that can work faith. Christ touched their eyes. He gives sight to blind souls by the power of his grace going with his word, and he puts the cure upon their faith. Those who apply to Jesus Christ, shall be dealt with, not according to their fancies, nor according to their profession, but according to their faith. Christ sometimes concealed his miracles, because he would not indulge the conceit which prevailed among the Jews, that their Messiah should be a temporal prince, and so give occasion to the people to attempt tumults and seditions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/9.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Then touched he their eyes - Simply to indicate that the power proceeded from him.

Your faith covered the whole extent of the work respecting my power and the absolute restoration to sight, and that power is exerted accordingly, and your sight is restored. So with the sinner. If he has faith in the Son of God; if he believes that he is able and willing to save him: and if he earnestly desires to be saved, the power of Jesus will be put forth to the full extent of his faith. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/9.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29. Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you&#8212;not, Receive a cure proportioned to your faith, but, Receive this cure as granted to your faith.

Not but that he could have restored sight to them, without touching their eyes, by a word speaking, or by the secret communication of his power; but he might do this as a sign of his favour and kindness to them, and of his will to cure them; as also in compliance with their weakness, who might expect some manual operation upon them; <p>saying, according to your faith be it unto you: not that faith in his person and power, was the cause or condition of this cure, or the rule and measure according to which Christ proceeded; but the sense is, that as they had believed he was able to heal them, accordingly a cure should be effected; which, upon his so saying, they immediately found performed in them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/9.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it unto you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/9.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-29.htm" title="Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it to you.">Matthew 9:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κατὰ</span>, <span class="ital">according to</span>) He says this by way of affirmation, not of limitation.—<span class="greekheb">γενηθήτω</span>, <span class="ital">let it be done</span>, or <span class="ital">let it become</span>) corresponding with the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">יהי</span>.[430]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[430] Used in the celebrated passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-3.htm" title="And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.">Genesis 1:3</a>, “And GOD said, ‘<span class="ital">Let there be</span> Light:’—and <span class="ital">there was</span> Light.”—(I.
