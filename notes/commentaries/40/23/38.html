The words “your house” may refer either generally to the whole polity of Israel, or more specifically to the “house” in which they gloried, the Temple, which was the joy of their hearts. It had been the house of God, but He, as represented by His Son, was now leaving it for ever. It was <span class= "ital">their</span> house now, not His. We must remember that the words were spoken as our Lord was “departing from the Temple” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-1.htm" title="And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple.">Matthew 24:1</a>), never to reappear there.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/matthew/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-38.htm" title="Behold, your house is left to you desolate....">Matthew 23:38-39</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold, your house </span>— The temple, which is now your house, not God’s; <span class="ital">is left unto you desolate </span>— Forsaken of God and his Christ, and sentenced to utter destruction.

Hence, in predicting their future conversion, he very properly alluded to that exclamation by which so many had expressed their faith in him as the Messiah. This was the last discourse Jesus pronounced in public, and with it his ministry ended. From that moment he abandoned the Jewish nation, gave them over to walk in their own counsels, and devoted them to destruction. Nor were they ever after to be the objects of his care, till the period of their conversion to Christianity should come, which he now foretold, and which also shall be accomplished in its season. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:34-39 Our Lord declares the miseries the inhabitants of Jerusalem were about to bring upon themselves, but he does not notice the sufferings he was to undergo. A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him. There is nothing between sinners and eternal happiness, but their proud and unbelieving unwillingness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your house - The temple.

Our Lord seems to have in view those passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-7.htm">Jeremiah 12:7</a> and which the Jewish (o) writers understood of the temple.

The <span class="greekheb">ἔρημος</span>, which is to be retained on critical grounds (see critical notes), intimates what is to be the <span class="ital">final result</span> of this abandonment, viz. the destruction of Jerusalem (<span class="greekheb">ἐρήμωσις</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm" title="Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his lord has made ruler over his household, to give them meat in due season?">Matthew 24:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-20.htm" title="And when you shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is near.">Luke 21:20</a>); on the proleptic use of the adjective, comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-13.htm" title="Then said he to the man, Stretch forth your hand.

Were your city any longer to be shielded by the divine protection, I would still linger among you; but I now leave you, and it is certain that henceforth (His presence among them, as He knows, being about to cease with His death, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-64.htm" title="Jesus said to him, You have said: nevertheless I say to you, Hereafter shall you see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.">Matthew 26:64</a>) you will not see me again until my second coming (not: in the destruction of Jerusalem, Wetstein), when I shall appear in the glory of the Messiah, and when, at my approach, you will have saluted (<span class="greekheb">εἴπητε</span>, <span class="ital">dixeritis</span>) me, whom you have been rejecting, with the Messianic confession <span class="greekheb">εὐλογημένος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

This is not to be understood of the <span class="ital">conversion of Israel</span> (Romans 11; Revelation 11) in its development down to the second coming (Bengel, Köstlin, Hofmann, Lange, Schegg, Auberlen, Ewald); for Jesus is addressing <span class="ital">Jerusalem</span>, and threatening it with the <span class="ital">withdrawal</span> of God’s superintending care, and that <span class="ital">until the second appearing</span> of Messiah (<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐρχόμενος</span>), and hence He cannot have had in view an intervening <span class="greekheb">μετάνοια</span> and regeneration of the city. No; the abandonment of the city on the part of God, which Jesus here announces, is ultimately to lead to her destruction; and then, at His second appearing, which will follow immediately upon the ruin of the city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-29.htm" title="Immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken:">Matthew 24:29</a>), His obstinate enemies will be constrained to join in the loyal greeting with which the Messiah will be welcomed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>), for the manifestation of His glory will sweep away all doubt and opposition, and <span class="ital">force them at last to acknowledge and confess Him</span> to be their Deliverer. A truly tragic feature at the close of this moving address in which Jesus bids farewell to Jerusalem, not with a <span class="ital">hope</span>, but with the certainty of ultimate, though sorrowful, <span class="ital">victory</span>. Euthymius Zigabenus very justly observes in connection with <span class="greekheb">ἕως ἂν εἴπητε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: <span class="greekheb">καὶ πότε τοῦτο εἴπωσιν</span>; <span class="greekheb">ἑκόντες μὲν οὐδέποτε</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἄκοντες δὲ κατὰ τὸν καιρὸν τῆς δευτέρας αὐτοῦ παρουσίας</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν ἥξει μετὰ δυνάμεως καὶ δόξης πολλῆς</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅταν οὐδὲν αὐτοῖς ὄφελος τῆς ἐπιγνώσεως</span>. Comp. Theophylact, Calvin, Gerhard, Calovius. Wieseler, p. 322, despairing of making sense of the passage, has gone the length of maintaining that some ancient reader of Matthew has inserted it from Luke. This view might seem, no doubt, to be favoured by the use, in the present instance, of <span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-37.htm" title="O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, you that kill the prophets, and stone them which are sent to you, how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens under her wings, and you would not!">Matthew 23:37</a>, the form in which the word regularly appears in Luke, and for which, on every other occasion, Matthew has <span class="greekheb">Ἱεροσόλυμα</span>; but it might very easily happen that, in connection with an utterance by Jesus of so remarkable and special a nature, the form given to the name of the city in the fatal words addressed to her would become so stereotyped in the Greek version of the evangelic tradition, that here, in particular, the Greek translator of Matthew would make a point of not altering the form “<span class="greekheb">Ἱερουσαλήμ</span>,” which had come to acquire so fixed a character as part of the utterance before us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is fair to assume that Christ’s exclamation over Jerusalem presupposes that the capital had repeatedly been the scene of His ministrations, which coincides with the visits on festival occasions recorded by John. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-39.htm" title="And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:">Acts 10:39</a>, and see Holtzmann, p. 440 f.; Weizsäcker, p. 310. Those who deny this (among them being Hilgenfeld, Keim) must assume, with Eusebius in the <span class="ital">Theophan</span>. (<span class="ital">Nova bibl. patr</span>. iv. 127), that by the children of Jerusalem are meant the <span class="ital">Jews in general</span>, inasmuch as the capital formed the centre of the <span class="ital">nation</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-25.htm" title="For this Agar is mount Sinai in Arabia, and answers to Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children.">Galatians 4:25</a>. Baur himself (p. 127) cannot help seeing the far-fetched character of this latter supposition, and consequently has recourse to the unwarrantable view that we have before us the words of a prophet speaking in the name of God,—words which were first put into the mouth of Jesus in their present form, so that, when they were uttered, <span class="greekheb">ποσάκις</span> would be intended to refer to the whole series of prophets and messengers, who had come in God’s name; just as Origen had already referred them to Moses and the prophets as well, in whom Christ was supposed to have been substantially present; comp.
