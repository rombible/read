From the blood of righteous <span class="ital">Abel </span>— The first prophet and preacher of righteousness, unto the <span class="ital">blood of Zacharias, son of Barachias </span>— Most commentators think that Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada the priest, mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm" title="And the Spirit of God came on Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest, which stood above the people, and said to them, Thus said God, Why transgress you the commandments of the LORD, that you cannot prosper? because you have forsaken the LORD, he has also forsaken you.">2 Chronicles 24:20</a>, (where see the note,) is here meant: and that either the words, <span class="ital">Song of Solomon of Barachias, </span>are the officious addition of some early transcriber of this gospel, (who might confound this martyr with <span class="ital">Zechariah, </span>one of the twelve minor prophets,) or that <span class="ital">Jehoiada </span>was also called <span class="ital">Barachiah, </span>having, as was not then uncommon, two names, both which, it may be observed, signify nearly the same thing: the latter word signifying <span class="ital">one that blesses the Lord, </span>and Jehoiada <span class="ital">one that confesses him. </span>Dr. Blayney, however, is confident that Zechariah, the minor prophet, is here intended, and that he was actually murdered, as is here said, though the Scriptures of the Old Testament are silent concerning the barbarous action. See the argument to my notes on Zechariah. <span class="ital">Whom ye slew </span>— So he says, because by imitating their fathers’ conduct, they made the murder, committed by them, their own; <span class="ital">between the temple </span>— That is, the house properly called the temple; <span class="ital">and the altar</span> — Which stood in the outer court. Our Lord seems to refer to this instance, rather than to any other, because he was the last of the prophets that was slain by the Jews for reproving their wickedness; and we may add, (supposing Zechariah the son of Jehoiada to be meant,) because God’s requiring his blood, as well as that of Abel, is particularly taken notice of in Scripture, that holy man’s last words being, <span class="ital">The Lord look upon it, and require it, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-22.htm" title="Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada his father had done to him, but slew his son.

It is bad to keep away from Christ ourselves, but worse also to keep others from him. Yet it is no new thing for the show and form of godliness to be made a cloak to the greatest enormities. But dissembled piety will be reckoned double iniquity. They were very busy to turn souls to be of their party. Not for the glory of God and the good of souls, but that they might have the credit and advantage of making converts. Gain being their godliness, by a thousand devices they made religion give way to their worldly interests. They were very strict and precise in smaller matters of the law, but careless and loose in weightier matters. It is not the scrupling a little sin that Christ here reproves; if it be a sin, though but a gnat, it must be strained out; but the doing that, and then swallowing a camel, or, committing a greater sin. While they would seem to be godly, they were neither sober nor righteous. We are really, what we are inwardly. Outward motives may keep the outside clean, while the inside is filthy; but if the heart and spirit be made new, there will be newness of life; here we must begin with ourselves. The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was like the ornaments of a grave, or dressing up a dead body, only for show. The deceitfulness of sinners' hearts appears in that they go down the streams of the sins of their own day, while they fancy that they should have opposed the sins of former days. We sometimes think, if we had lived when Christ was upon earth, that we should not have despised and rejected him, as men then did; yet Christ in his Spirit, in his word, in his ministers, is still no better treated. And it is just with God to give those up to their hearts' lusts, who obstinately persist in gratifying them. Christ gives men their true characters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fill ye up, then ... - This is a prediction of what they were about to do.

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are like whited sepulchres&#8212;or, whitewashed sepulchres. (Compare Ac 23:3). The process of whitewashing the sepulchres, as Lightfoot says, was performed on a certain day every year, not for ceremonial cleansing, but, as the following words seem rather to imply, to beautify them.<p>which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all uncleanness&#8212;What a powerful way of conveying the charge, that with all their fair show their hearts were full of corruption! (Compare Ps 5:9; Ro 3:13). But our Lord, stripping off the figure, next holds up their iniquity in naked colors.<p>Wherefore ye be witnesses unto yourselves, that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets&#8212;that is, "ye be witnesses that ye have inherited, and voluntarily served yourselves heirs to, the truth-hating, prophet-killing, spirit of your fathers." Out of pretended respect and honor, they repaired and beautified the sepulchres of the prophets, and with whining hypocrisy said, "If we had been in their days, how differently should we have treated these prophets?" While all the time they were witnesses to themselves that they were the children of them that killed the prophets, convicting themselves daily of as exact a resemblance in spirit and character to the very classes over whose deeds they pretended to mourn, as child to parent. In Lu 11:44 our Lord gives another turn to this figure of a grave: "Ye are as graves which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them." As one might unconsciously walk over a grave concealed from view, and thus contract ceremonial defilement, so the plausible exterior of the Pharisees kept people from perceiving the pollution they contracted from coming in contact with such corrupt characters.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-33.htm" title="You serpents, you generation of vipers, how can you escape the damnation of hell?">Matthew 23:33</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers. Of their sins; for there were bounds and limits set how far they should proceed, and no further; as yet they had not got to the end of their iniquity: their fathers had gone great lengths in sin, but their iniquity was not yet full, as is said of the Amorites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a> these their sons were to fill it up. They had shed the blood of many of the prophets; and indeed there were none of them but they had persecuted and abused, in one shape or another: some they entreated shamefully, others they beat: some they stoned, and others they put to death with the sword, or otherwise; and now their children were about to fill the measure brimful, by crucifying the Son of God, which they were at this time meditating and contriving; and by persecuting and slaying his apostles, and so would bring upon them the vengeance of God. The Jews well enough understood these words, which were spoken to them in an ironical way, and expressing what they were about, and what they would hereafter do, and what would be the issue and consequence of it: they have a saying (o), that "the holy blessed God does not take vengeance on a man, <p> , "until his measure is filled up"; according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-22.htm">Job 20:22</a>. <p>Which the Chaldee paraphrase renders, <p>"when his measure is filled up, then shall he take vengeance on him; <p>and that this is Christ's sense, appears from what follows, <p>(o) T.
