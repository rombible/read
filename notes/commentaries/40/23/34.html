A hen gathering her chickens under her wings, is an apt emblem of the Saviour's tender love to those who trust in him, and his faithful care of them. He calls sinners to take refuge under his tender protection, keeps them safe, and nourishes them to eternal life. The present dispersion and unbelief of the Jews, and their future conversion to Christ, were here foretold. Jerusalem and her children had a large share of guilt, and their punishment has been signal. But ere long, deserved vengeance will fall on every church which is Christian in name only. In the mean time the Saviour stands ready to receive all who come to him.

Wherefore, behold, I send unto you prophets, and wise men, and scribes&#8212;The I here is emphatic: "I am sending," that is, "am about to send." In Lu 11:49 the variation is remarkable: "Therefore also, said the wisdom of God, I will send them," &c. What precisely is meant by "the wisdom of God" here, is somewhat difficult to determine. To us it appears to be simply an announcement of a purpose of the Divine Wisdom, in the high style of ancient prophecy, to send a last set of messengers whom the people would reject, and rejecting, would fill up the cup of their iniquity. But, whereas in Luke it is "I, the Wisdom of God, will send them," in Matthew it is "I, Jesus, am sending them"; language only befitting the one sender of all the prophets, the Lord God of Israel now in the flesh. They are evidently evangelical messengers, but called by the familiar Jewish names of "prophets, wise men, and scribes," whose counterparts were the inspired and gifted servants of the Lord Jesus; for in Luke (Lu 11:49) it is "prophets and apostles."<p>unto the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and the altar&#8212;As there is no record of any fresh murder answering to this description, probably the allusion is not to any recent murder, but to 2Ch 24:20-22, as the last recorded and most suitable case for illustration. And as Zacharias' last words were, "The Lord require it," so they are here warned that of that generation it should be required.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-36.htm" title="Truly I say to you, All these things shall come on this generation.">Matthew 23:36</a>"</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Wherefore, behold I send unto you prophets,.... To try them, whether they would show the respect to prophets, they pretended to have for them; by building and beautifying their sepulchres; by exclaiming against their forefathers for shedding their blood; and by declaring, that had they lived in their days, they would not have joined with them in it; and to make it appear, that these were all empty words, and specious pretences; and that they had the same malicious and bloody principles in them; and would be guilty of the same practices, and so fill up the measure of their fathers' sins; and bring upon them the punishment of everlasting burnings hereafter, as well as ruin and destruction on their nation, city, and temple now. Christ here speaks, as, one having power and authority, to qualify and send forth men, under the several characters here mentioned, and of what he should do after his resurrection: for notwithstanding the people of the Jews would crucify him, and use him as they did, in a barbarous manner; yet after all this, he would send his ministers to them, to gather his elect out from among them, to render the rest inexcusable, and to show his longsuffering and patience. The persons designed by "prophets", "wise men", and "Scribes", are his apostles: called "prophets"; because they were divinely inspired to write, and preach in his name; had the gift of foretelling future events, and of explaining with the greatest clearness and exactness, the prophecies of the Old Testament; showing their respect unto, and accomplishment in Christ: "wise men"; because they were made wise unto salvation, and capable of instructing others: they were filled with all spiritual and evangelical wisdom, and preached the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom: and Scribes; because they were well instructed in the kingdom of heaven, and had the true knowledge of the law, and could rightly interpret it, as well as make known the Gospel of the grace of God. Christ chooses to use these names and titles, because the Jews pretended to have great veneration for the ancient prophets, and these he should send, would not be a whit inferior to them, but in many things exceed them; and they had great esteem for their wise men and Scribes, who would be vastly exceeded by these ministers of his, and yet would be used very badly by them: <p>and some of them ye shall kill; as Stephen, the first "martyr", who was stoned to death by them; and James, the brother of John, whom Herod, to their good liking, killed with the sword; and the other James they threw headlong from off the pinnacle of the temple, and killed him with a fuller's club (r), <p>And crucify; so Simeon, the son of Cleophas, was crucified at the instigation of the Jews, as Eusebius relates (s), <p>And some of them ye shall scourge in your synagogues; as John, Peter, and Paul: <p>and persecute them from city to city; as they did Paul and Barnabas, as the Acts of the Apostles testify, <p>(r) Euseb.

In this Strauss, following in the wake of Baur, is influenced by anti-Johannine leanings.

J. C.

These are midway between prophets and scribes.—<span class="greekheb">ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕῖς</span>, <span class="ital">scribes</span>) who edit and illustrate the remains of the prophets and wise men, as Ezra did.

Because ye are resolved on imitating your forefathers' iniquities, you will also reject the messengers that are sent to you, and shall suffer righteous condemnation. <span class="cmt_word">I send</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">unto you.</span> The sending had already begun. In the parallel passage of St. Luke (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-49.htm">Luke 11:49</a>) we read, "Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send." Christ is the Wisdom of God, and by his own authority gives mission to his messengers. "As the Father hath sent me, even so send I you" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/20-21.htm">John 20:21</a>), he says to his apostles; and to such he is referring in the words which follow. <span class="cmt_word">Prophets</span>. The apostles were of like character, inspiration, and influence as the prophets under the old dispensation, and succeeded in their place as exponents of God's will and heralds of the covenant. <span class="cmt_word">Wise men.</span> Men full of the Holy Ghost and heavenly wisdom. <span class="cmt_word">Scribes</span>. Not in the then Jewish sense, but instructors in the new law of life, the law of Christ's religion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-52.htm">Matthew 13:52</a>). All the means of teaching and edification employed aforetime were abundantly and more effectually supplied under the gospel. St. Luke has, "prophets and apostles." <span class="cmt_word">Kill</span>; as Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-59.htm">Acts 7:59</a>), James (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-2.htm">Acts 12:2</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Crucify</span>; as Peter (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-18.htm">John 21:18, 19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-14.htm">2 Peter 1:14</a>); Simeon (Eusebius, 'Hist. Eccl.,' 3:32); and probably Andrew. <span class="cmt_word">Scourge</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-40.htm">Acts 5:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-19.htm">Acts 22:19</a> 26:11; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-24.htm">2 Corinthians 11:24, 25</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Persecuted</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-50.htm">Acts 13:50</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm">Acts 14:5, 6, 19, 20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-11.htm">Acts 26:11</a>; and compare Christ's prediction, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-17.htm">Matthew 10:17, 18</a>). The passage in the Second (Fourth) Book of Esdras 1:32, which is strikingly parallel to our Lord's denunciation, may possibly be a Christian interpolation, "I sent unto you my servants the prophets, whom ye have taken and slain, and torn their bodies in pieces, whose blood I will require of your hands, saith the Lord." </body></html>
