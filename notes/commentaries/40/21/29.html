It is the first stage of repentance, and may, as in this instance, pass on into the higher, or, as in the case of Judas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm" title="Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,">Matthew 27:3</a>, where the same word is used), end only in remorse and despair.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:28-32 Parables which give reproof, speak plainly to the offenders, and judge them out of their own mouths. The parable of the two sons sent to work in the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism to be of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The whole human race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but they have rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in their disobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebel is brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while the formalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But what think ye? - A way of speaking designed to direct them particularly to what he was saying, that they might be self-convicted.<p>Two sons - By those two sons our Lord intends to represent the conduct of the Jews, and that of the publicans and sinners.<p>In my vineyard - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>.

Which answer fitly expresses the language and practice of openly profane and unregenerate sinners, who will not come to Christ, that they may have life; nor will they serve the Lord, but are bent upon indulging their lusts; nor will they be subject to the law of God; nor will they hear and receive the Gospel of Christ, or submit to his ordinances, and are averse to every good work: where is man's free will? this is the true picture of it; man has no will naturally to that which is good, <p>But afterward he repented, and went: a change of mind was wrought in him, and this produced a change of life and conversation: so, many of the publicans and sinners repented of their sins of disobedience, and rebellion against God, under the ministry of John the Baptist, Christ, and his apostles; not of themselves, men do not naturally see their sin, or need of repentance; their hearts are hard and obdurate; nor have they any spiritual sense and feeling: nothing will bring them to repentance, not the most powerful ministry, the severest judgments, or the kindest mercies, without the grace of God: but it was of God, and owing to his powerful and efficacious grace, that they repented: it was his will they should come to repentance: he called them to it, and gave it to them, as a free grace gift of his: and they repented not in a mere legal way, with a legal repentance, which lies in a mere conviction of the outward acts of sin; in an external sorrow for it, in horror and terror of mind about it, and in shedding tears for it, accompanied with a cessation from the grosser acts of sin, and an outward reformation of life and manners: but they repented in an evangelical manner, as such do, who are really converted, and spiritually instructed; who are true believers in Christ, have views, and, at least, hopes of pardoning grace and mercy; and have the love of God shed abroad in their hearts by the Spirit: the repentance of such lies in a spiritual sight and sense of sin, of the evil nature of indwelling sin, and the exceeding sinfulness of it, as well as of the outward actions of life; in a hearty, godly sorrow for it, because committed against a God of purity, grace, and goodness; in a loathing it, and themselves for it; in a holy shame, and blushing, on account of it; and is attended with an ingenuous confession of it, and forsaking it: the consequence of which is, that such go readily and cheerfully into the Lord's vineyard; hear the word with all diligence, receive it with gladness; walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord; and are taught, by the grace that has appeared to them, to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this world. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-29.htm" title="He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented, and went.">Matthew 21:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐγώ</span>: laconic and emphatic as if eager to obey—<span class="greekheb">κύριε</span>, with all due politeness, and most filial recognition of paternal authority, the two words = our “Yes, sir”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">29</span>. <span class="ital">repented</span>] Rather “changed his mind,” felt regret but not repentance or <span class="ital">Metanoia</span>, a deeper and more lasting feeling: see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm" title="And saying, Repent you: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 3:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to a well-supported reading the cases of the two sons are reversed.

Though it is fairly claimed that the word here implies all that is implied in the other word, the New Testament writers evidently recognize a distinction, since the noun which corresponds to the verb in this passage (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;) is not used at all in the New Testament, and the verb itself only five times; and, in every case except the two in this passage (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-32.htm">Matthew 21:32</a>), with a meaning quite foreign to repentance in the ordinary gospel sense. Thus it is used of Judas, when he brought back the thirty pieces (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-3.htm">Matthew 27:3</a>); of Paul's not regretting his letter to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-8.htm">2 Corinthians 7:8</a>); and of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/7-21.htm">Hebrews 7:21</a>). On the other hand, &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c9;, repent, used by John and Jesus in their summons to repentance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>), occurs thirty-four times, and the noun &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, repentance (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/3-8.htm">Matthew 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-11.htm">Matthew 3:11</a>), twenty-four times, and in every case with reference to that change of heart and life wrought by the Spirit of God, to which remission of sins and salvation are promised. It is not impossible, therefore, that the word in this passage may have been intended to carry a different shade of meaning, now lost to us. &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, as its etymology indicates (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, after, and &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;, to be an object of care), implies an after-care, as contrasted with the change of mind denoted by &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;. Not sorrow for moral obliquity and sin against God, but annoyance at the consequences of an act or course of acts, and chagrin at not having known better. "It may be simply what our fathers were wont to call hadiwist (had-I-wist, or known better, I should have acted otherwise)" (Trench). &#x39c;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; refers chiefly to single acts; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; denotes the repentance which affects the whole life. Hence the latter is often found in the imperative: Repent ye (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-2.htm">Matthew 3:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-17.htm">Matthew 4:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-19.htm">Acts 3:19</a>); the former never. Paul's recognition of the distinction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-10.htm">2 Corinthians 7:10</a>) is noteworthy. "Godly sorrow worketh repentance (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;) unto salvation," a salvation or repentance "which bringeth no regret on thinking of it afterwards" (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;). There is no occasion for one ever to think better of either his repentance or the salvation in which it issued. </body></html>
