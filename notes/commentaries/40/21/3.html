Of these (3) is all but excluded by the facts of the case. The words involve a claim to more than common authority, and the claim is recognised at once. In favour of (2) we have the numerous instances in which the disciples and the evangelists not only address their Master as “Lord,” but speak of Him as “the Lord” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-6.htm" title="He is not here: for he is risen, as he said.

And none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.">John 21:12</a>). For (1), lastly, we have our Lord’s use of the word as a synonym for God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-19.htm" title="However, Jesus suffered him not, but said to him, Go home to your friends, and tell them how great things the Lord has done for you, and has had compassion on you.">Mark 5:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/13-20.htm" title="And except that the Lord had shortened those days, no flesh should be saved: but for the elect's sake, whom he has chosen, he has shortened the days.">Mark 13:20</a>). On the whole (2) appears to commend itself as most in accordance with the customary language of the disciples. On the very probable assumption that the owners of the colt were, in some sense, themselves disciples, they would recognise the full import of the words thus addressed to them, and obey without hesitation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord hath need of them - This means no more than the "master" has need of them. The word "Lord" often means no more than "master" as opposed to servant, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-24.htm">Matthew 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-5.htm">Ephesians 6:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5-6</a>. The word is sometimes used in the Bible as applied to God, or as a translation of the name Yahweh. Its common use is a mere title of respect given by an inferior to a superior, by a servant to a master, by a disciple to a teacher. As a title of "high respect" it was given to Christ, or the Messiah. The persons to whom these disciples were sent were probably acquainted with the miracles of Jesus and favorably disposed toward him He had attracted great notice in that region, particularly by raising Lazarus from the dead, and most of the people regarded him as the Messiah. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>Mt 21:1-9. Christ's Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem on the First Day of the Week. ( = Mr 11:1-11; Lu 19:29-40; Joh 12:12-19).<p>For the exposition of this majestic scene&#8212;recorded, as will be seen, by all the Evangelists&#8212;see on [1333]Lu 19:29-40.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div>Ver. 1-3. This famous story of our Lord’s entrance into Jerusalem is recorded by Mark, and Luke also: by Mark, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,">Mark 11:1</a></span>; by Luke, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a></span>. There is little difference in their relation of it thus far; afterwards we shall find more. I shall consider what they all say, that I may at once give the story perfect. Mark saith, <span class="ital">Bethphage and Bethany.</span> He saith, <span class="ital">ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat.</span> Luke hardly varies at all from Mark, at least in nothing considerable. Our Lord was come now very nigh Jerusalem; Bethany was but fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem, that was about two miles, wanting an eighth part, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-18.htm" title="Now Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off:">John 11:18</a></span>; it was the town of Lazarus, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-1.htm" title="Now a certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha.">John 11:1</a></span>. Matthew names only Bethphage, which was a place at the same distance, at the foot of the Mount of Olives, so called from the plenty of olive trees growing there; this mount was betwixt Jerusalem and Bethphage. It is like our Saviour was at both these towns, for Mark and Luke nameth both. From one of them he sendeth two of his disciples to a village near hand, telling them they should there find, at their entrance in, an ass tied, with a colt, on which yet never man sat. Mark and Luke only mention the colt, because Christ rode only upon the colt. Matthew mentions the ass, for the fulfilling of the prophecy, of which we shall hear in the next verses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Loose them, and bring them unto me. And if any man say ought unto you, </span>( which he knew they would, and Mark and Luke tell us they did), <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them.</span> Not, our Lord, but <span class="ital">the Lord</span> of heaven and earth, whose are the cattle upon a thousand hills, <span class="ital">hath need of them:</span> not for any weariness; he who had travelled on foot from Galilee to Bethany, could have gone the other two miles; but that he might enter into Jerusalem as was prophesied of him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm" title="Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem: behold, your King comes to you: he is just, and having salvation; lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.">Zechariah 9:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And straightway he will send them.</span> The words are so, as may be understood as a promise of Christ to send them back, but it is more likely they are intended as an assurance to the disciples that the owners would make no difficulty to send them. These instructions (considered with the success) were an evident argument of Christ’s Divine nature, who could tell all particular circumstances, and also which way the heart of man would incline. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And if any man say ought unto you,.... As, what business have you with the ass and colt? why do you loose them? as certain persons, the owners of them did, as Mark and Luke relate; <p>ye shall say, the Lord hath need of them: he that is our Lord, and your Lord, and the Lord of these creatures, and of all things else, wants them for his present service; <p>and straightway he will send them: which is either a continuation of what the disciples should say to any that should ask them the reason of their loosing the ass and colt, in order to make them easy: that the Lord who had need of them, as soon as he had done with them, would send them back to their proper owners, safe and well: or they are spoken for the encouragement of the disciples to go, and not be disheartened, though they should be thus examined; for immediately upon saying, that the Lord stood in need of them, and had an use for them at that time, the owner thereof, without any more words, would immediately send them along with them; which latter rather seems to be the sense of the clause; and which is confirmed by Mark: a very clear proof is this of the omniscience of Christ. He knew, that there were an ass, and a colt, in such a village, fastened to such a door, just at the entrance into the town: he knew the owners of it would examine the disciples about loosing and taking them away, and prepares them to give an answer; and he knew that the minds of these owners would be immediately wrought upon, and inclined to let them go directly and quietly. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And if any <i>man</i> say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath need of them; and straightway <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> he will send them.</span><p>(a) He that will say anything to you will let them go, that is, the ass and the colt.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-3.htm" title="And if any man say ought to you, you shall say, The Lord has need of them; and straightway he will send them.">Matthew 21:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐάν τις</span>, etc. Of course it was to be expected that the act would be challenged.—<span class="greekheb">ἐρεῖτε</span>, ye shall say, future with imperative force.—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, recitative, introducing in direct form the words of the Master.—<span class="greekheb">ὸ Κύριος</span>, the Lord or Master; not surely = Jehovah (Alford, G.

And he answered and said, I go, sir: and went not.">Matthew 21:30</a> of this chap.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν χρείαν ἔχει</span>, hath need of them; in what sense? Looking to the synop. narratives alone, one might naturally infer that the need was <span class="ital">physical</span>, due to the fatigue of a toilsome, tedious ascent. But according to the narrative in 4th Gospel the starting point of the day’s journey was Bethany (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-1.htm" title="At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn; and his disciples were an hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn and to eat.">Matthew 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-12.htm" title="How much then is a man better than a sheep? Why it is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.">Matthew 12:12</a>). The prophetic reference in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-4.htm" title="All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying,">Matthew 21:4</a> suggests a wholly different view, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that the animals were needed to enable Jesus to enter Jerusalem in a manner conformable to prophetic requirements, and worthy of the Messianic King. One is conscious of a certain reluctance to accept this as the exclusive sense of the <span class="greekheb">χρεία</span>. Lutteroth suggests that Jesus did not wish to mix among the crowd of pilgrims on foot lest His arrival should be concealed and the interest awakened by His presence lessened.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>.

The present is more forcible, but the future is well attested. The simple announcement that the asses were needed for God's service would silence all refusal. The disciples, indeed, were to act at once, as executing the orders of the supreme Lord, and were to use the given answer only in case of any objection. Throughout the transaction Christ assumes the character of the Divine Messiah, King of his people, the real Owner of all that they possess. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>The Lord (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>From &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, supreme power, authority.
