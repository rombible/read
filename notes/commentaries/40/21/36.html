As men treat God's people, they would treat Christ himself, if he were with them. How can we, if faithful to his cause, expect a favourable reception from a wicked world, or from ungodly professors of Christianity! And let us ask ourselves, whether we who have the vineyard and all its advantages, render fruits in due season, as a people, as a family, or as separate persons. Our Saviour, in his question, declares that the Lord of the vineyard will come, and when he comes he will surely destroy the wicked. The chief priests and the elders were the builders, and they would not admit his doctrine or laws; they threw him aside as a despised stone. But he who was rejected by the Jews, was embraced by the Gentiles. Christ knows who will bring forth gospel fruits in the use of gospel means. The unbelief of sinners will be their ruin. But God has many ways of restraining the remainders of wrath, as he has of making that which breaks out redound to his praise. May Christ become more and more precious to our souls, as the firm Foundation and Cornerstone of his church. May we be willing to follow him, though despised and hated for his sake.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And beat one - The word translated here as "beat" properly means to flay or to take off the skin; hence to beat or to whip so that the skin in many places is taken off.<p>And killed another - Isaiah is said to have been put to death by sawing him asunder.<p>Many other of the prophets were also put to death.

This does not I imply, of necessity, that those who were stoned "died," but they might be only severely wounded. Mark says, "At him they cast stones and wounded him in the head, and sent him away," etc.<p>There is a little variation in the circumstances as mentioned by Matthew, and by Mark and Luke, but the substance is the same. Mark and Luke are more particular, and state the order in which the servants were sent one after another. They all denote the dealing of the people of Israel toward the prophets. All these things had been done to them. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-37.htm">Hebrews 11:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm">Jeremiah 44:4-6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm">2 Chronicles 36:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/24-20.htm">2 Chronicles 24:20-21</a>.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>36.

Mark agrees in the substance, but mentions three single servants sent, and then many others. The first he saith <span class="ital">they caught, and beat, and sent away empty.</span> At the second he saith <span class="ital">they cast stones, wounded him in the head, and sent him away</span> <span class="ital">shamefully handled.</span> The third he saith <span class="ital">they killed; </span> and for others, they did beat some, and kill some. Luke speaks to the same sense. I observed before, that we must not look to fit every particular phrase in a parable in the explication. By the <span class="ital">servants</span> here sent to the husbandmen are doubtless to be understood those extraordinary prophets, whom in the corrupt state of the Jewish church God sent to reprove the priests, and to admonish the priests, as well as the people, of the duty which they owed unto God, in obedience to his law. And the various phrases here used, to express the indignities offered to the servants, do but signify the various abuses offered to many of these prophets, of which are instances in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-10.htm" title="And he said, I have been very jealous for the LORD God of hosts: for the children of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and slain your prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away.">1 Kings 19:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-16.htm" title="But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words, and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose against his people, till there was no remedy.">2 Chronicles 36:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm" title="Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against you, and cast your law behind their backs, and slew your prophets which testified against them to turn them to you, and they worked great provocations.">Nehemiah 9:26</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-4.htm" title="However, I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate.">Jeremiah 44:4</a>,5</span>.
