As the words stand in Zechariah (we need not here discuss the question as to the authorship or composition of that book) they paint the ideal King coming, not with “chariot” and “horse” and “battle bow,” like the conquerors of earthly kingdoms, but as a prince of peace, reviving the lowlier pageantry of the days of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm" title="Speak, you that ride on white asses, you that sit in judgment, and walk by the way.">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm" title="And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.">Judges 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-14.htm" title="And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on three score and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight years.">Judges 12:14</a>), and yet exercising a wider dominion than David or Solomon had done, “from sea to sea, and from the river (Euphrates) to the ends of the earth” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-10.htm" title="And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he shall speak peace to the heathen: and his dominion shall be from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of the earth.">Zechariah 9:10</a>). That ideal our Lord claimed to fulfil. Thus interpreted, His act was in part an apparent concession to the fevered expectations of His disciples and the multitude; in part also a protest, the meaning of which they would afterwards understand, against the character of those expectations and the self-seeking spirit which mingled with them. Here, as before, we trace the grave, sad accommodation to thoughts other than His own to which the Teacher of new truths must often have recourse when He finds Himself misinterpreted by those who stand altogether on a lower level. They wished Him to claim the kingdom, that they might sit on His right hand and on His left. Well, He would do so, but it would be a kingdom “not of this world” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-36.htm" title="Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.">John 18:36</a>), utterly unlike all that they were looking for.<p><span class= "bld">A colt the foal of an ass.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">of a beast of burden,</span> the word not being the same as that previously used. In the Hebrew of Zechariah the word reproduces the old poetic phraseology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-11.htm" title="Binding his foal to the vine, and his ass's colt to the choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes in the blood of grapes:">Genesis 49:11</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-11 This coming of Christ was described by the prophet Zechariah, Zec 9:9. When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All this was done ... - The prophecy here quoted is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>.

But after Solomon’s time the Jews got a breed of horses; so as only poor people rode upon asses, mostly reserved for burdens.

These words seem to be taken out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-11.htm">Isaiah 62:11</a> where it is said, "say ye to the daughter of Zion, behold thy salvation cometh", or "thy Saviour cometh"; meaning, without doubt, the Messiah: by the daughter of Zion is meant, not the city of Jerusalem, but the inhabitants thereof, the Jewish synagogue; or as the Targum renders it, , "the congregation of Zion", the people of the Jews; particularly the elect of God among them, those that embraced the true Messiah, and believed in him: <p>behold, thy king cometh unto thee: this, and what follow, are cited from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a> and to be understood of the king Messiah, who, in a little time after this prophecy was given out, was to come to Zion, and redeem Jacob from all his iniquities, and was now come. One of the Jewish commentators says (x), that interpreters are divided about the sense of this prophecy; but observes, that there are some that say this is the Messiah: and another (y) of them affirms, that it is impossible to explain it of any other than the king Messiah; and that it can be understood of no other, I have elsewhere (z) shown. "Meek"; in the prophecy of Zechariah it is,  "poor", as the Messiah Jesus was, in a temporal sense; but the word, both by the Septuagint, and our evangelist, is rendered <p>meek; as it is by the Targum, Jarchi, and Kimchi, who all explain it by  "lowly, humble, or meek": and a character it is, that well agrees with Jesus, who, in the whole of his deportment, both in life and in death, was a pattern of meekness and lowliness of mind: and <p>sitting upon an ass, and a colt, the foal of an ass. This is applied to the Messiah by the Jews, both ancient (a) and modern (v), who consider this as an instance and evidence of his humility: they suppose, this ass to be a very uncommon one, having an hundred spots on it; and say, that it was the foal of that which was created on the eve of the sabbath (w); and is the same that Abraham and Moses rode upon: and they own, as before observed, that Jesus of Nazareth rode on one to Jerusalem, as is here related. Their ancient governors, patriarchs, princes, and judges, used to ride on asses, before the introduction and multiplication of horses in Solomon's time, forbidden by the law of God: wherefore, though this might seem mean and despicable at this present time, yet was suitable enough to Christ's character as a king, and as the son of David, and king of Israel; strictly observing the law given to the kings of Israel, and riding in such manner as they formerly did. <p>(x) Aben Ezra in Zech. ix. 9.

The prophet is predicting the triumph of Israel and the fall of the neighbouring nations. The prophecy contains three distinct Hebrew words for an “ass.” “Sitting upon an ass (<span class="ital">chamâr</span>, from a root meaning <span class="ital">red</span>) and a colt (<span class="ital">air</span>, ‘a young male ass’) the foal (lit. ‘the son’) of an ass (<span class="ital">athôn</span> = ‘a she-ass,’ from a root meaning ‘slow’).”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">meek</span>] See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm" title="Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.">Matthew 5:5</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm" title="Tell you the daughter of Sion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.">Matthew 21:5</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἴπατε</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <span class="ital">tell ye</span>, etc.) This passage is one of those which show that many things in the prophets ought to be received by us, not only as they were meant by them, but as they were destined to be meant by the apostles.

The passage in Zechariah begins, "Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of Jerusalem." The "daughter of Zion" is Jerusalem herself, named from the chief of the hills on which the city was built. Of course, the term includes all the inhabitants. <span class="cmt_word">Behold</span>; marking the suddenness and unexpected nature of the event. <span class="cmt_word">Thy King.</span> A King of thine own race, no stranger, one predestined for thee, foretold by all the prophets, who was to occupy the throne of David and to reign forever. <span class="cmt_word">Unto thee.</span> For thy special good, to make his abode with thee (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meek</span>. As Christ himself says, "I am meek and lowly in heart" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-29.htm">Matthew 11:29</a>), far removed from pomp and warlike greatness; and yet, according to his own Beatitude, the meek shall inherit the earth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-5.htm">Matthew 5:5</a>), win victories which material forces can never obtain, triumph through humiliation. The original in Zechariah gives other characteristics of Messiah: "He is just, and having salvation;" <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. endowed with salvation, either as being protected by God, or victorious and so able to save his people. <span class="cmt_word">Sitting upon an ass.</span> Coming as King, he could not walk undistinguished among the crowd; he must ride. But to mount a war horse would denote that he was leader of an army or a worldly potentate; so he rides upon an ass, an animal used by the judges of Israel, and chieftains on peaceful errands (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-4.htm">Judges 10:4</a>); one, too, greatly valued, and often of stately appearance in Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">And</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;</span>) <span class="cmt_word">a colt the foal of an ass;</span> such as she asses bear, and one not trained. It is questioned whether the conjunction here expresses addition, implying that Christ mounted both animals in succession, or is merely explanatory, equivalent to videlicet, <span class="accented">an ass, yea, even the foal of an ass</span>. It seems unlikely that, in accomplishing the short distance between Bethphage and Jerusalem (only a mile or two), our Lord should have changed from one beast to the other; and the other three evangelists say expressly that Christ rode the colt, omitting all mention of the mother. The she ass doubtless kept close to its foal, so the prophecy was exactly fulfilled, but the animal that bore the Saviour was the colt. If the two animals represent respectively the Jews and Gentiles (see on ver. 2), it seems hardly necessary for typical reasons that Jesus should thus symbolize his triumph over the disciplined Jews, while it is obvious that the lesson of his supremacy over the untaught Gentiles needed exemplification. The prophet certainly contemplates the two animals in the procession. "The old theocracy runs idly and  instinctively by the side of the young Church, which has become the true bearer of the Divinity of Christ" (Lange). No king had ever thus come to Jerusalem; such a circumstance was predicted of Messiah alone, and Christ alone fulfilled it to the letter, showing of what nature his kingdom was. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Daughter of Sion<p>Jerusalem.
