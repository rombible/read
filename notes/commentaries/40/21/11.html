When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved - There was great excitement. The sight of such a multitude, the shouts of the people, and the triumphant procession through the city, excited much attention and inquiry. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>Mt 21:10-22.

Such an unusual sight might well affect a great number in Jerusalem with admiration and astonishment, the people, especially, giving honour to him as a King, and calling him the Son of David; and certainly, but that the meanness of his appearance and meanness of his followers put uninterested men out of fear, and gave Herod and Pilate some security that there was no attempt on foot against the civil government, our Saviour and his followers would have been apprehended, as raisers of a sedition and rebellion. But the multitude now gave him no other title than that of Jesus the Prophet; which yet was enough to distinguish him from other prophets, for he was Jesus a Saviour, and the Prophet foretold, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm" title="The LORD your God will raise up to you a Prophet from the middle of you, of your brothers, like to me; to him you shall listen;">Deu 18:15</a>,18,19</span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the multitude said,.... Or the people, as the Vulgate Latin, and Munster's Hebrew Gospel read; the common people, that went before, and followed after him: these knew Christ better than the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the Scribes and Pharisees, and rulers of the people. <p>This is Jesus the prophet: that prophet Moses spoke of, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-15.htm">Deuteronomy 18:15</a> and the nation of the Jews in general expected: <p>of Nazareth of Galilee; who, though he was not born there, yet being educated, and having lived much in that place, is said to be of it; and which was the common opinion of the people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-11.htm" title="And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.">Matthew 21:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὁ τροφήτης</span>, <span class="ital">the Prophet</span>) Jesus was first acknowledged as a Prophet, then as Priest and King.—<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀπὸ Ναζαρὲτ</span>, <span class="ital">of Nazareth</span>) This was a customary appellation [for Him].<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The multitude;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;&#x20;&#x1f44;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>: <span class="accented">the multitudes</span>.

They give his name, title, and dwelling place. They call him "the Prophet," either as being the One that was foretold (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-21.htm">John 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-14.htm">John 6:14</a>), or as being inspired and commissioned by God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9.htm">John 9</a>.17). The appellation, "of Nazareth," clung to our Lord through all his earthly life. St. Matthew (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-23.htm">Matthew 2:23</a>) notes that the prophets had foretold that he was to be called a Nazarene, and that this prediction was in some sort fulfilled by his dwelling at Nazareth. We know not who were the prophets to whom the evangelist refers, and in this obscurity the attempted explanations of exegetes are far from satisfactory; so it is safer to fall back upon the inspired historian's verdict, and to mark the providential accomplishment of the prediction in the title by which Jesus was generally known. Says Isaac Williams, "Friends and foes, chief priests in hate, Pilate in mockery, angels in adoration, disciples in love, Christ himself in lowliness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-8.htm">Acts 22:8</a>), and now the multitudes in simplicity, all proclaim him 'of Nazareth.'" </body></html>
