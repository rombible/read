We have to think of the journey up the narrow valley that leads from Jericho to Jerusalem. Our Lord, as before, was followed by the disciples, and they in their turn were followed by the crowds of pilgrims who were drawn to the Holy City either by the coming Passover or by wonder and curiosity to see what part the Prophet of Nazareth would take. Throughout the multitude, including the disciples, there was a feverish expectation that He would at last announce Himself as the Christ, and claim His kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-11.htm" title="And as they heard these things, he added and spoke a parable, because he was near to Jerusalem, and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear.">Luke 19:11</a>). They reach Bethany “six days before the Passover,” probably, <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> on the Friday afternoon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm" title="Then Jesus six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, which had been dead, whom he raised from the dead.">John 12:1</a>). They remain there for the Sabbath, probably in the house of Lazarus or Simon the leper (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-2.htm" title="There they made him a supper; and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of them that sat at the table with him.">John 12:2</a>; and in that of the latter we have the history of the anointing, which St. Matthew relates, out of its chronological order, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-6.htm" title="Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the leper,">Matthew 26:6-13</a>). The point of time with which the narrative, which now becomes more continuous, opens, may be fixed at the dawn of the first day of the week, the daybreak of Palm Sunday.<p><span class= "bld">Bethphage.</span>—The village is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-29.htm" title="And it came to pass, when he was come near to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount called the mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,">Luke 19:29</a>, and in many MSS. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-1.htm" title="And when they came near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sends forth two of his disciples,">Mark 11:1</a>, in conjunction with Bethany, and before it, and from this it would seem probable that it lay on the road from Jericho, and was therefore to the east of Bethany. The traditional site, however, followed in most maps, makes it to the west of Bethany, and nearer the summit of the hill. The name signified “the house of unripe figs,” as Bethany did “the house of dates,” and Gethsemane “the oil-press,” the three obviously indicating local features giving distinctness to the three sites. All three were on the Mount of Olives. Bethany is identified with the modern <span class= "ital">El-’Azariyeh,</span> or <span class= "ital">Lazarieh</span> (the name attaching to its connection with the history of Lazarus), which lies about a mile below the summit on the eastern slope of the Mount of Olives, in a woody hollow planted with olives, almonds, pomegranates, and figs. The palms implied in the name of Bethany and in the history of the entry into Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-13.htm" title="Took branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried, Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that comes in the name of the Lord.">John 12:13</a>) have disappeared.<p><span class= "bld">Two disciples.</span>—The messengers are not named in any of the Gospels.

So that this was the prologue to his passion. <span class="ital">And were come to Bethphage </span>— Mark says, <span class="ital">and Bethany. Then sent Jesus two disciples, saying, Go into the village over against you </span>— This, as the Arabian geographer informs us, was a little village two miles distant from the mount of Olives, toward the south. <span class="ital">And straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her </span>— As Mark and Luke say that <span class="ital">the colt was tied, </span>the words of Matthew contain an ellipsis, which must be supplied thus, <span class="ital">and a colt bound with her. </span>It must be observed, also, that the other evangelists make mention only of the colt, because our Lord sat on him only. See note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>. Here we have “a wonderful instance of Christ’s prescience in very minute matters.

When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem - They were going up now from Jericho.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-29.htm">Matthew 20:29</a>. The distance was about 19 miles. The most of the way was a desert, or filled with caves, and rocks, and woods - a suitable place for robbers. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm">Luke 10:30</a>. The Mount of Olives, or "Olivet," is on the east of Jerusalem. Between this and Jerusalem there runs a small stream called the brook Kidron, or Cedron. It is dry in the hot seasons of the year, but swells to a considerable size in time of heavy rains. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>. The Mount of Olives was so called from its producing in abundance the olive. It was from Jerusalem about a Sabbath-day's journey. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>. On the west side of the mountain was the garden of Gethsemane, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-39.htm">Luke 22:39</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/14-32.htm">Mark 14:32</a>. On the eastern declivity of the mountain were the villages of Bethphage and Bethany. Mark and Luke say that he came near to both those places.<p>He appears to have come first to Bethany, where he passed the night <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-9.htm">John 12:9-11</a>, and in the morning sent over to the adjacent village Bethphage. Bethany was the place where Lazarus lived, whom he raised from the dead <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/11.htm">John 11</a>; where Martha and Mary lived; and where Mary anointed him with ointment against the day of his burying, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1-7</a>. The Mount of Olives is about a mile in length and about 700 feet in height, and overlooks Jerusalem, so that from its summit almost every part of the city can be seen. The mountain is composed of three peaks or summits. The "olive" is a fruit well known among us as an article of commerce. The tree blooms in June, and bears white flowers. The fruit is small. It is first green, then whitish, and, when fully ripe, black. It encloses a hard stone in which are the seeds. The "wild olive" was common, and differed from the other only in being of a smaller size. There are two roads from Jerusalem to Bethany; one around the southern end of the Mount of Olives, and the other across the summit. The latter is considerably shorter, but more difficult, and it was probably along this road that the Saviour went. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>Mt 21:1-9.

The Syriac, Persic, and Ethiopic versions read, "when he drew nigh, or was near"; but not alone, his disciples were with him, and a multitude of people also; as is evident from the following account. They might well be said to be near to Jerusalem, since it is added, <p>and were come to Bethphage; which the Jews say (n) was within the walls of the city of Jerusalem, and was in all respects as the city itself, and was the outermost part of it (o); and that all within the outward circumference of the city of Jerusalem was called Bethphage (p): it seems to me to be part of it within the city, and part of it without, in the suburbs of it, which reached to Bethany, and that to the Mount of Olives. Various are the derivations and etymologies of this place: some say it signifies "the house", or "place of a fountain", from a fountain that was in it; as if it was a compound of "Beth", an house, and  "pege", a fountain: others, "the house of the mouth of a valley"; as if it was made up of those three words,  , because the outward boundary of it was at the foot of the Mount of Olives, at the entrance of the valley of Jehoshaphat: others say, that the ancient reading was "Bethphage, the house of slaughter"; and Jerom says (q), it was a village of the priests, and he renders it, "the house of jaw bones": here indeed they might bake the showbread, and eat the holy things, as in Jerusalem (r); but the true reading and signification of it is,  "the house of figs"; so called from the fig trees which grew in the outward limits of it, near Bethany, and the Mount of Olives; hence we read of (s)  , "the figs of Bethany"; which place is mentioned along with, Bethphage, both by Mark and Luke, where Christ, and those with him, were now come: the latter says, they were come nigh to these places, for they were come <p>to the Mount of Olives; near to which were the furthermost limits of Bethany, and Bethphage, from Jerusalem. This mount was so called from the abundance of olive trees which grew upon it, and was on the east side of Jerusalem (t); and it was distant from it a sabbath day's journey, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a> which was two, thousand cubits, or eight furlongs, and which made one mile: <p>then sent Jesus two disciples; who they were is not certain, perhaps Peter and John, who were afterwards sent by him to prepare the passover, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-8.htm">Luke 22:8</a>. <p>(n) Gloss. in T.

Still, as regards the dates of the passion week, there remains this fundamental divergence, that, according to the Synoptists, the Friday on which Jesus died was the 15th, while according to John (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-28.htm" title="Then led they Jesus from Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: and it was early; and they themselves went not into the judgment hall, lest they should be defiled; but that they might eat the passover.">John 18:28</a>) it was the 14th of Nisan; and further, that <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-12.htm" title="On the next day much people that were come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,">John 12:12</a> represents Jesus as having passed the night at Bethany previous to His triumphal entry, while according to the synoptical account He appears to have gone at once from Jericho to Jerusalem.

If, as is believed, his crucifixion took place on the fourteenth day of the month Nisan, the triumphal entry must be assigned to the ninth, which day was reckoned to commence at one sunset and to continue till the follow-lug evening. This is regarded as the first day of the Holy Week, and is called by Christians from very early times Palm Sunday (see on ver. 10). He had probably gone straight from Jericho to Bethany. and spent the sabbath there with his friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-6.htm">Matthew 26:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-1.htm">John 12:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Bethphage</span>. The name means <span class="accented">House of figs</span>, and was appropriate to a locality where such trees grew luxuriantly. The village has not been identified with certainty, though it is considered with great probability to be represented by <span class="accented">Kefr-et-Tur</span>, on a summit of Olivet, within the bounds of Jerusalem, <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. two thousand cubits' distance from the city walls. Bethany is below the summit, in a nook on the western slope and somewhat further from the city. The Mount of Olives is separated from Jerusalem by the valley of the Kedron, and has three summits, the centre one being the highest; but though it is of no great elevation in itself, it stands nearly four thousand feet above the Dead Sea, from which it is distant some thirteen miles. <span class="cmt_word">Then sent Jesus two disciples.</span> Their names are not given, and it is useless to conjecture who they were, though probably Peter was one of them. Alford suggests that the triumphal entry in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11.htm">Mark 11</a>. is related a day too soon, and that our Lord made two entries into Jerusalem - the first a private one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-11.htm">Mark 11:11</a>), and the second, public, on the morrow But there is no sufficient reason to discredit the common tradition, and St. Mark's language can be otherwise explained. The deliberate preparation for t. he procession, and the intentional publicity, so contrary to Christ's usual habits, are very remarkable, and can be explained only by the fact that he was now assuming the character and claims of Messiah, and putting himself forward in his true dignity and office as "King of the Jews." By this display he made manifest that in him prophecy was fulfilled, and that the seeing eye and the believing heart might now find all that righteous men had long and wearily desired. This was the great opportunity which his mercy offered to Jerusalem, if only she would accept it and turn it to account. In fact, she acknowledged him as King one day, and then rejected and crucified him. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Bethphage<p>House of figs. </body></html>
