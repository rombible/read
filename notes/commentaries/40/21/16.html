The shouts of the children were therefore a surprise to them, and they turned to the Teacher and asked whether He accepted them in the sense in which they were addressed to Him. Had He really entered the Temple claiming to be the expected Christ? Did He approve this interruption of the order and quiet of its courts?<p><span class= "bld">Have ye never read?</span>—Better, <span class= "ital">did ye never read?</span> The question was one which our Lord frequently asked in reasoning with the scribes who opposed Him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-3.htm" title="But he said to them, Have you not read what David did, when he was an hungered, and they that were with him;">Matthew 12:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-4.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, Have you not read, that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female,">Matthew 19:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-42.htm" title="Jesus said to them, Did you never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes?">Matthew 21:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-31.htm" title="But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,">Matthew 22:31</a>). It expressed very forcibly the estimate which He formed of their character as interpreters. They spent their lives in the study of the Law, and yet they perverted its meaning, and could not see its bearing on the events that passed around them. In this instance He cites the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm" title="Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings have you ordained strength because of your enemies, that you might still the enemy and the avenger.">Psalm 8:2</a>, the primary meaning of which appears to be that the child’s wonder at the marvels of Creation is the truest worship. As applied by our Lord their lesson was the same. The cries of the children were the utterance of a truth which the priests and scribes rejected. To Him, to whom the innocent brightness of childhood was a delight, they were more acceptable than the half-hearted, self-seeking homage of older worshippers. The words are quoted from the LXX. translation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/matthew/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:12-17 Christ found some of the courts of the temple turned into a market for cattle and things used in the sacrifices, and partly occupied by the money-changers. Our Lord drove them from the place, as he had done at his entering upon his ministry, Joh 2:13-17. His works testified of him more than the hosannas; and his healing in the temple was the fulfilling the promise, that the glory of the latter house should be greater than the glory of the former. If Christ came now into many parts of his visible church, how many secret evils he would discover and cleanse! And how many things daily practised under the cloak of religion, would he show to be more suitable to a den of thieves than to a house of prayer!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>When the chief priests ... - The chief men of the nation were envious of his popularity.<p>They could not prevent it; but, being determined to find fault, they took occasion to do so from the shouts of the children. People often are offended that "children" have anything to do with religion, and deem it very improper that "they" should rejoice that the Saviour has come. Our Lord Jesus viewed this subject differently. He saw that it was proper that they should rejoice. they are interested in the concerns of religion, and before evil principles get fast hold of their minds is a proper time for them to love and obey him. The Lord Jesus silenced those who made the objection by appealing to a text of their own Scriptures. This text is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>. The quotation is not made directly from the Hebrew. but from the Greek translation. This, however, should create no difficulty. The point of the quotation was to prove that "children" might offer praise to God.

The cry of the children doubtless more displeased them; it was of the same nature with that of the multitude in the way, and in the streets, when our Lord came into Jerusalem; they owned Christ as the Messiah, and gave him praise, and wished all manner of felicity to him.

In the Psalm it is added, "because of thine enemies, that thou might still the enemy, and the avenger": by whom are meant the high priests, the Scribes and Pharisees, the mortal enemies of Christ, who were full of enmity against him, and wanted to revenge themselves on him for spoiling their market at this time; but were stilled by the "Hosannas" of the children, and Christ's defence of them.

The ruling thought of the opening verses is the glory of God set forth in His works. The “scarcely articulate” cry of an infant proves, like the heaven and the stars, the power and providence of God. On all these God builds a stronghold against His adversaries, i. e. convinces them of His might. So also the children in the temple attest the truth of God.

We may suppose that the little children in this instance caught up the words of those of riper age (with which view, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-9.htm" title="And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.">Matthew 21:9</a>): and yet that circumstance was not without being valued in the sight of God. Only let one not be wanting to his fellow in setting a good example: the Lord will take care of the rest, nay, indeed He will take care of all things.—V. g.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[921] The passage in Maccabees runs thus:—“O my son, have pity upon me that bare thee nine months in my womb, and <span class="ital">gave thee suck three years</span>, and nourished thee, and brought thee up unto this age.” The same practice still prevails in the East. In Persia, male children are often kept at the breast till three years of age, and are never taken from it till two years and two months. In India the period is precisely three years. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/31-16.htm" title="Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and upward, even to every one that enters into the house of the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges according to their courses;">2 Chronicles 31:16</a>, no provision is assigned for the children of Priests and Levites until after three years of age, which gives additional weight to the supposition that they were not weaned till that time. Amongst the ancient Greeks, also, it appears that mothers suckled their children till a comparatively late period.—(I. B.)<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/matthew/21.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hearest thou what these say?</span> They profess a great zeal for God's honour. They recognize that these cries implied high homage, if not actual worship, and appeal to Jesus to put a stop to such unseemly behaviour, approaching, as they would pretend, to formal blasphemy. <span class="cmt_word">Yea</span>. Jesus replies that he hears what the children say, but sees no reason for silencing them; rather he proves that they were only fulfilling an old prophecy, originally, indeed, applied to Jehovah, but one which he claims as addressed to himself. <span class="cmt_word">Have ye never read?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>). The quotation is from the confessedly Messianic psalm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8.htm">Psalm 8</a>.), a psalm very often quoted in the New Testament, and as speaking of Christ (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-27.htm">1 Corinthians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-27.htm">1 Corinthians 15:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-6.htm">Hebrews 2:6</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Sucklings</span>. This term was applied to children up to the age of three years (see 2 Macc. 7:27), but might be used metaphorically of those of tender age, though long weaned. <span class="cmt_word">Thou hast perfected praise.</span> The words are from the Septuagint, which seems to have preserved the original reading. The present Hebrew text gives, "Thou hast ordained strength," or "established a power." In the Lord's mouth the citation signifies that God is praised acceptably by the weak and ignorant when, following the impulse of their simple nature, they do him homage. Some expositors combine the force of the Hebrew and Greek by explaining that "the strength of the weak is praise, and that worship of Christ is strength" (Wordsworth). It is more simple to say, with Nosgen, that for the Hebrew "strength," "praise" is substituted, in order to give the idea that the children's acclamation was that which would still the enemy, as it certainly put to shame the captious objections of the Pharisees. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Say (&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>The Rev. is more graphic, are saying.

Its secondary meaning is to furnish completely, equip; hence to perfect. Thou hast provided the perfection of praise. The quotation from <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/8-2.htm">Psalm 8:2</a>, follows the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew, which is, "Thou hast founded strength." </body></html>
