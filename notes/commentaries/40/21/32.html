The parable of the two sons sent to work in the vineyard, is to show that those who knew not John's baptism to be of God, were shamed by those who knew it, and owned it. The whole human race are like children whom the Lord has brought up, but they have rebelled against him, only some are more plausible in their disobedience than others. And it often happens, that the daring rebel is brought to repentance and becomes the Lord's servant, while the formalist grows hardened in pride and enmity.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But what think ye? - A way of speaking designed to direct them particularly to what he was saying, that they might be self-convicted.<p>Two sons - By those two sons our Lord intends to represent the conduct of the Jews, and that of the publicans and sinners.<p>In my vineyard - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-33.htm">Matthew 21:33</a>.

Matthew alone mentions this parable. The scope of it is taught us <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-31.htm" title="Whether of them two did the will of his father?

Who these Pharisees and who the publicans were, we showed before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-7.htm" title="But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come?">Matthew 3:7</a></span>. The publicans were very odious to the Jews: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/2-16.htm" title="And when the scribes and Pharisees saw him eat with publicans and sinners, they said to his disciples, How is it that he eats and drinks with publicans and sinners?">Mark 2:16</a></span>. Harlots are great sinners. By <span class="ital">the kingdom of God, </span> here, is meant that of glory. Our Lord’s saying that publicans and harlots should go in before the Pharisees, doth not imply that they should follow. It only signifieth that some who had been publicans (as Matthew and Zacchaeus) and harlots were in a better condition than these Pharisees. He proves it because they had done the will of God, which the Pharisees, notwithstanding all their fair profession, had not, but resisted it, and particularly in the ministry of John the Baptist, who came to them in the way of righteousness, preaching the true doctrine of righteousness, and living a holy and righteous life; upon the hearing of whose doctrine, some of the publicans and other great sinners had believed in Christ; but the Pharisees, though they heard his doctrine, saw his conversation, and saw others repent and own Christ, yet were so far from believing, that they would not repent, that they might believe; they would not be awakened to any sense of their sinful courses, nor amend any thing of their former ways, that they might receive Christ and embrace his righteousness and salvation. For although evangelical repentance is the fruit of faith, yet that repentance which lieth in a previous sense of sin, and a resolution to leave sinful courses, goeth before it. Now to illustrate and press this home upon the consciences of these Pharisees, our Saviour brings this parable, (as Nathan did to David, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-1.htm" title="And the LORD sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and said to him, There were two men in one city; the one rich, and the other poor.">2 Samuel 12:1</a>,11</span>) that they might, being convicted, condemn themselves. Hence the parable is easily understood: The <span class="ital">man</span> mentioned is God. The <span class="ital">two sons</span> were the Pharisees, a people highly pretending obedience to the law of God, and making a great show of religion. And <span class="ital">the publicans and harlots, </span> great sinners, bad and vile people, making no pretence to religion. God saith to the one and the other, <span class="ital">Go, work in my vineyard, </span> that is, do my will, do the work I command you to do. The Pharisees, so hypocrites and formalists, by their outward pretence and profession, say, <span class="ital">I go, sir; </span> but yet go not; all their religion is a vain show, a mere outside appearance. Others by their lives declare that they will not go; but yet upon second thoughts, having their hearts touched by the finger of God, they do God’s work. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say unto him, The first.</span> This is plain; for what was the will of the father, but that they should do the work he set them to do? This the latter did not. The father’s will was not only that the son should give him a cap and a knee, and compliment him, but that he should go to work in the vineyard. It is the least part of God’s will that men should give him good words, be a little complemental and ceremonious toward him; but that they should repent and believe, and obey his gospel. This some publicans and harlots did; the generality of the Pharisees refused. It is a hard thing to convince a moral, righteous, civil man, that he lacks any thing to salvation; and hence it is that profane persons many times repent, believe, and are saved, when others perish in their impenitency and unbelief, because they think they have no need of repentance, or any further righteousness than they are possessed of. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For John came unto you in a way of righteousness,....

John came with a special call to the rulers of the people, and they made some show of interest, by sending a deputation to demand his credentials, and by coming to his baptism; but that was all. They did not alter their lives or change their faulty opinions at his preaching, though they "were willing for a season to rejoice in his light" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-35.htm">John 5:35</a>). <span class="cmt_word">In the way of righteousness.</span> In that path of strict obedience to law, and of ascetic holiness, which you profess to regard so highly. If they had followed the path which John indicated, they would have attained to righteousness and salvation. John preached Christ who is "the Way" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). (For "way," meaning doctrine, religious tenet and practice, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-16.htm">Matthew 22:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-2.htm">Acts 9:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-9.htm">Acts 19:9, 23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-21.htm">2 Peter 2:21</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Ye believed him not,</span> to any practical purpose, even as it is said elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-30.htm">Luke 7:30</a>), "The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected for themselves the counsel of God, not having been baptized of him." Those who did receive his baptism were the exception; the great majority stood aloof. <span class="cmt_word">Believed him.</span> Though these sinners may have first rejected him, yet his preaching softened their hearts; they repented, confessed their sins, and were baptized (see for examples, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-10.htm">Luke 3:10</a>, etc.; Luke 7:29). This was another call to the Pharisees to go and do likewise. <span class="cmt_word">When ye had seen it;</span> <span class="accented">i</span>.<span class="accented">e</span>. the fruits of true repentance in these sinners, which conversion was indeed a loud appeal to the rulers to consider their own ways, and to bow to God's hand. <span class="cmt_word">Repented not</span> (see ver. 29). They profited not by this miracle of grace. <span class="cmt_word">That ye might believe him.</span> The end and result of repentance would be to believe in John's mission, and to attend to his teaching. Christ offers the above explanation of the parable (vers. 31, 32) in view of the purpose for which he uttered it. It has been, and may be, taken in different senses, and in wider application. "What is set forth in individual cases is but a sample of what takes place in whole classes of persons, and even nations" (I. Williams). Many expositors consider the two sons to represent Gentiles and Jews; the former making no profession of serving God, and yet in time being converted and turning to him; the latter making much outward show of obedience, yet in reality denying him and rejecting salvation. It is obvious that such explanation is allowable, and coincides with the letter of the parable; but it does not satisfy the context, and fails in not answering to Christ's intention in uttering this similitude. Others see herein a picture of what happens in Christian lands, and is the experience of every Christian minister - how the irreligious and apparently irreclaimable are by God's grace brought, to repentance unto life; how the seemingly pious often make much show, but fall away, or bring no fruit unto perfection. And as the parable involves a general principle, so it may be applied universally to those who make great professions of religion, and are for a time full of good resolutions, but in practice fall very short; and to those who have been the slaves of lust, covetousness, or some other wickedness, but have been recovered from the snares of the devil, and have learned to lead a godly, righteous, and sober life. </body></html>
