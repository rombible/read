When Christ would appear in his glory, it is in his meekness, not in his majesty, in mercy to work salvation. As meekness and outward poverty were fully seen in Zion's King, and marked his triumphal entrance to Jerusalem, how wrong covetousness, ambition, and the pride of life must be in Zion's citizens! They brought the ass, but Jesus did not use it without the owner's consent. The trappings were such as came to hand. We must not think the clothes on our backs too dear to part with for the service of Christ. The chief priests and the elders afterwards joined with the multitude that abused him upon the cross; but none of them joined the multitude that did him honour. Those that take Christ for their King, must lay their all under his feet. Hosanna signifies, Save now, we beseech thee! Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord! But of how little value is the applause of the people! The changing multitude join the cry of the day, whether it be Hosanna, or Crucify him. Multitudes often seem to approve the gospel, but few become consistent disciples. When Jesus was come into Jerusalem all the city was moved; some perhaps were moved with joy, who waited for the Consolation of Israel; others, of the Pharisees, were moved with envy. So various are the motions in the minds of men upon the approach of Christ's kingdom.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And put on them their clothes - This was done as a token of respect, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/matthew/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 21<p>Mt 21:1-9.

To Jesus, as Mark and Luke add, and who only make mention of the colt: both were undoubtedly brought; the colt being unloosed and taken away, the ass, its dam, followed after: <p>and put on them their clothes; their loose upper garments, to be instead of saddles and trappings, and that Christ might sit thereon with ease and decency: the other evangelists say, that they cast their garments on the colt; and the Syriac version here reads, "they put their garments on the colt, and Jesus rode upon it": but as both were brought, it is clear from hence, that their clothes were put upon both; not knowing which Christ would choose to ride on. And it should seem, that it was not unusual to put garments on asses to ride on; for the Targumist on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-10.htm">Judges 5:10</a> represents the princes of Israel as riding upon asses, strewed or saddled with all kind  of "painted garments". The Persic version, without the least colour of authority from the original text, renders it, "and Jesus put his own garment on the colt, and sat thereon"; which is ridiculous, as well as contrary to truth: <p>and they sat him thereon, or "on them": meaning either on the ass and colt, that is, on one of them, or both successively, or on the clothes they put upon them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> clothes, and they set <i>him</i> <span class="cverse3">{d}</span> thereon.</span><p>(c) Their uppermost garment.<p>(d) Upon their garments, not upon the ass and the colt.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/matthew/21.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon.">Matthew 21:7</a>.

Were we to refer <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> to the <span class="ital">animals</span>, the result would be the absurd idea (which Strauss, B. Bauer, Volkmar make use of against Matthew) that Jesus mounted both of them <span class="ital">at once</span>, not <span class="ital">one after the other</span> (Fritzsche, Fleck), seeing that <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπεκάθισεν ἐπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> denotes the instantaneous, finished act which followed the spreading of the garments. To suppose (Ebrard, Olshausen), by way of justifying the reference to the animals, that we have here a loose form of speech, corresponding to the German phrase: he leaps from the horses, and such like, is out of the question, for the simple reason that no such <span class="greekheb">σύλληψις</span> can be assumed in the case of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-5.htm" title="Tell you the daughter of Sion, Behold, your King comes to you, meek, and sitting on an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass.">Matthew 21:5</a>, all the less so that, from this verse, it would appear that it was the <span class="ital">dam</span> on which Jesus rode, with the foal walking by her side.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/matthew/21.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/21-7.htm" title="And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their clothes, and they set him thereon....">Matthew 21:7-11</a>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὄνον καὶ τὸν πῶλον</span>: that both were brought is carefully specified in view of the prophetic oracle as understood by the evangelist to refer to two animals, not to one under two parallel names.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπέθηκαν</span>: the two disciples spread their upper garments on the two beasts, to make a seat for their Master.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπεκάθισεν ἐπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>: if the second <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> be taken to have the same reference as the first the meaning will be that Jesus sat upon both beasts (alternately). But this would require the imperfect of the verb instead of the aorist. It seems best, with many ancient and modern interpreters, to refer the second <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> to the garments, though on this view there is a certain looseness in the expression, as, strictly speaking, Jesus would sit on only one of the mantles, if He rode only on one animal. Fritzsche, while taking the second <span class="greekheb">ἀ</span>. as referring to <span class="greekheb">ἱμάτια</span>, thinks the evangelist means to represent Jesus as riding on both alternately.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/matthew/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">put on them their clothes</span>] Their upper garments, the <span class="ital">abbas</span> of modern Arabs.

Thus the received text, and the Vulgate, <span class="accented">Et eum desuper sedere fecerunt</span>. But most modern editors, with great manuscriptural authority, read, "he sat thereon." Some have taken the pronoun <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> to refer to the beasts, and Alford supports the opinion by the common saying, "The postilion rode on the horses," when, in fact, he rode only one of the pair. But the analogy is erroneous. The postilion really guides and controls both; but no one contends that Christ kept the mother ass in hand while mounted on the colt. The pronoun is more suitably referred to the garments, which formed a saddle for the Saviour, or housings and ornamental appendages (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-13.htm">2 Kings 9:13</a>). He came invested with a certain dignity and pomp, yet in such humble guise as to discountenance all idea of temporal sovereignty. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/matthew/21.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Set him thereon<p>But the preferable reading is &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;, he took his seat upon.<p>A very great multitude (&#x3bf;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;)<p>The A.

The disciples spread their garments on the beasts; the multitude strewed their own garments in the way. Dr. Edward Robinson, cited by Dr. Morison, speaking of the inhabitants of Bethlehem who had participated in the rebellion of 1834, says:" At that time, when some of the inhabitants were already imprisoned, and all were in deep distress, Mr. Farrar, then English consul at Damascus, was on a visit to Jerusalem, and had rode out with Mr. Nicolayson to Solomon's Pools. On their return, as they rose the ascent to enter Bethlehem, hundreds of people, male and female, met them, imploring the consul to interfere in their behalf, and afford them his protection; and all at once, by a sort of simultaneous movement, they spread their garments in the way before the horses."<p>The variation of tenses is not preserved in the English versions. Spread their garments, aorist tense, denoting one definite act. Cut down, spread in the way, imperfects, denoting continued action. As Jesus advanced, they kept cutting branches and spreading them, and the multitude kept crying. </body></html>
