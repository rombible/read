His just expectations from flourishing professors are often disappointed; he comes to many, seeking fruit, and finds leaves only. A false profession commonly withers in this world, and it is the effect of Christ's curse. The fig-tree that had no fruit, soon lost its leaves. This represents the state of the nation and people of the Jews in particular. Our Lord Jesus found among them nothing but leaves. And after they rejected Christ, blindness and hardness grew upon them, till they were undone, and their place and nation rooted up. The Lord was righteous in it. Let us greatly fear the doom denounced on the barren fig-tree.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/matthew/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And all things ... - He adds an encouragement for them to pray, assuring them that they should have all things which they asked.<p>This promise was evidently a special one, given to them in regard to working miracles.

Luke hath nothing of this passage, but Mark relates it with some variation and additions: the variation is only as to time, as to which the evangelists were not curious. Matthew relates this miracle as done in the morning of the second day, as Christ and his disciples returned from Bethany; so doth <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-12.htm" title="And on the morrow, when they were come from Bethany, he was hungry:">Mark 11:12</a></span>: but Matthew speaks as if the disciples discerned it presently withered; Mark mentions it as not discerned to be withered till the next morning, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-20.htm" title="And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.">Mark 11:20</a></span>. Mark saith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-13.htm" title="And seeing a fig tree afar off having leaves, he came, if haply he might find any thing thereon: and when he came to it, he found nothing but leaves; for the time of figs was not yet.">Mark 11:13</a></span>, <span class="ital">for the time of figs was not yet; </span> which breeds a difficulty, why our Saviour should curse the fig tree for having no fruit, when the time for its fruit was not come (of which more by and by). Mark saith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-21.htm" title="And Peter calling to remembrance said to him, Master, behold, the fig tree which you cursed is withered away.">Mark 11:21</a>,22</span>, that <span class="ital">Peter calling to remembrance his Master’s cursing the fig tree, saith unto him, Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away. And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.</span> Then repeats the substance of what Matthew hath in <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-21.htm" title="Jesus answered and said to them, Truly I say to you, If you have faith, and doubt not, you shall not only do this which is done to the fig tree, but also if you shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; it shall be done.">Matthew 21:21</a>,22</span>; to which Mark addeth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-25.htm" title="And when you stand praying, forgive, if you have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.">Mark 11:25</a>,26</span>, <span class="ital">And when ye stand praying, forgive, if ye have ought against any: that your Father also which is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. But if ye do not forgive, neither will your Father which is in heaven forgive you your trespasses.</span> When our Lord had been in the temple, and driven out the buyers and sellers there, he went out of the city to be at Bethany, either to avoid the noises of the city, (now very full of people, the passover being so nigh), or to get a more private place for prayer. He returns the next morning; and being hungry, and seeing a fig tree in his way, he goes to it, finds it full of leaves, but no fruit on it. He saith unto it, Never fruit grow on thee more. Mark saith, <span class="ital">For the time of figs was not yet.</span> Why then doth our Saviour curse this tree? Some think that by <span class="ital">time</span> is here meant season (as indeed the Greek word often signifieth); these would have the meaning to be, for it was not a seasonable year for figs. But this rather augments than abates the difficulty, for why should our Saviour curse it for having no figs, when the year was such as was not seasonable? Others therefore think that ou should be ou, then the English would be, Where he was was a time of figs. For this it is said; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That the Greek spirits and accents were ordinarily left out in ancient copies, which if they be taken away the words are the same. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. That this was according to truth, for it was a time of green figs, at least; it being near Jerusalem, and but three or four days before the passover, about which time they reaped their corn, as appears from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-10.htm" title="Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When you be come into the land which I give to you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest:">Leviticus 23:10</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-9.htm" title="Seven weeks shall you number to you: begin to number the seven weeks from such time as you begin to put the sickle to the corn.">Deu 16:9</a></span>; and it is plain from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-13.htm" title="The fig tree puts forth her green figs, and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair one, and come away.">Song of Solomon 2:13</a></span>, that in the beginning of their spring their fig trees put forth green figs. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But when I consider that none of the ancient translations are according to this criticism, but as our translations, I conclude that the ancients understood it ou, not ou, and it seemeth too bold to interpret the words contrary to their unanimous sense. Others therefore tell us, that fig trees, or at least some kind of them, (like orange trees), had leaves and fruit upon them always, some green, some half ripe, some full ripe; and that these kept on their leaves all the winter: so that our Saviour seeing leaves, might be led to it with an expectation of some fruit put forth the former year, for the time for the ripening of fruit of that kind that year was not come; and finding none, he cursed it; thereby in a type showing what should be done to barren souls, who have only leaves, no true fruit of righteousness. Or what if we should say, that he did not curse it with any respect to its want of fruit, but only to show his Divine power, working a miracle? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And presently the fig tree withered away:</span> as soon as our Saviour had cursed it, it began to wither. Mark tells us this was the next morning, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-20.htm" title="And in the morning, as they passed by, they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots.">Mark 11:20</a></span>, which made Peter say, <span class="ital">Master, behold, the fig tree which thou cursedst is withered away.</span> Matthew saith, <span class="ital">When the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How soon is the fig tree withered away!</span> Upon this our Saviour telleth Peter and the rest, that if they had faith, and doubted not, they should not only do that which he had done to the fig tree, but if they said to that mountain, Be removed and cast into the sea, it should be done. This is interpreted by <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-22.htm" title="And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.">Matthew 21:22</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer believing, ye shall receive.</span> We met with the like expression before, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-20.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for truly I say to you, If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you.">Matthew 17:20</a></span>. Mark hath the same, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-23.htm" title="For truly I say to you, That whoever shall say to this mountain, Be you removed, and be you cast into the sea; and shall not doubt in his heart, but shall believe that those things which he said shall come to pass; he shall have whatever he said.">Mark 11:23</a></span>. Luke hath it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/17-6.htm" title="And the Lord said, If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this sycamine tree, Be you plucked up by the root, and be you planted in the sea; and it should obey you.">Luke 17:6</a></span>. It is an expression which ought not to be strained further than to signify, that there is nothing conducive to the glory of God and our own good, but believers may receive at the hand of God, if they can believe without doubting that what they would have shall come to pass. I see no reason to discourse of a faith of miracles as different from other faith; which only thus differed, that the disciples (the apostles I mean) had a power given them, and a promise made to them, that they should be able to work miraculous operations, which is not given to other Christians serving only the particular occasions of that time, to give credit to the gospel. The general proposition is true, and shall be made good to every believer, That whatsoever good is made the matter of a promise, (such are all good things), shall be given to believing souls, praying for them. But there were of old special promises, not made to the people of God in general, but to particular persons, for particular ends; we cannot expect to do or obtain such things now. Nothing is too big for true faith to obtain, but that faith must have a promise to lean upon, and it must be showed by prayer, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-22.htm" title="And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.">Matthew 21:22</a></span>. Mark adds, that it must be also attended with charity, a charitable heart, ready to forgive, and actually forgiving, our brethren their trespasses. But it is no more than we met with in Matthew, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-14.htm" title="For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you:">Matthew 6:14</a>,15</span>, where we opened the sense of those words. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/matthew/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all things whatsoever,....

Munster's Hebrew Gospel reads it, "in prayer, and in faith"; and the Arabic version renders it, "in prayer with faith"; both to the same purpose, and aptly express the sense of the words, which design the prayer of faith; or that prayer which is put up in the strength of faith; and is of great avail with God: for whatever is asked in faith, agreeable to the will of God, which is contained in his covenant, word, and promises, and makes for his glory, and the good of his people, shall be given, be it what it will; though to carnal sense and reason it may seem impracticable and impossible: <p>ye shall receive; of God, through Christ, freely and fully, and shall have and enjoy them, either they themselves, if asked for themselves, or others, for whom they are asked. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/matthew/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing, ye shall receive.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/matthew/21.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-22.htm" title="And all things, whatever you shall ask in prayer, believing, you shall receive.">Matthew 21:22</a>. <span class="greekheb">Αἰτήσητε ἐν τῇ προσευχῇ</span>, <span class="ital">ye shall ask in prayer</span>[925]) see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-24.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, What things soever you desire, when you pray, believe that you receive them, and you shall have them.">Mark 11:24</a>.

A man must have no latent doubt in his heart; he must not debate whether the thing desired can be done or not; he must have absolute trust in the power and good will of God; and he must believe that "what he saith cometh to pass" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-23.htm">Mark 11:23</a>). The faith required is the assurance of things hoped for, such as gives substance and being to them while yet out of sight. The words had their special application to the apostles, instructing them that they were not to expect to be able, like their Master, to work the wonders needed for the confirmation of the gospel by their own power. Such effects could be achieved only by prayer and faith. (On the general promise to faithful prayer, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-7.htm">Matthew 7:7-11</a>.) </body></html>
