St. Paul, in the words “in pretence” and “in truth,” is speaking of the motives of the preachers, not of the substance of their preaching. For the latter he cares much; for the former nothing. When (as at Corinth) the rejection of his personal authority was bound up with rejection of his apostolic doctrine, he rebukes it vehemently; when (as here) there was no such connection, it is to him a very small thing. But we may also gather from this that, whatever might be the case at Philippi, at Rome St. Paul’s Epistle had done its work, and the battle of principle was won; even at Colossæ it had wholly changed its character (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-16.htm" title=" Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days:">Colossians 2:16-23</a>), and its old phases had passed away. The differences between the parties at Rome were no longer fundamental, although, as so often is the case, the bitterness of division might remain. “Every way Christ was preached,” and accepted as justifying through faith. This being so, St. Paul could rejoice. Even an imperfect Christianity, with something of narrowness, and perhaps of superstitious formalism, cleaving to it, was as different from the gross heathenism which it superseded, as light from darkness.<p><span class= "bld">Yea, and will rejoice.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">I shall rejoice</span> to the end. The words lead on to the next verse, which gives the reason of this persistent rejoicing.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice....">Php 1:18-20</a></span>. <span class="ital">What then? </span>— What shall we think of these attempts, proceeding from such different principles? Shall they grieve us? No, in no wise. For, <span class="ital">every way, whether in pretence </span>— Under colour of propagating the gospel; <span class="ital">or in truth </span>— With a real design so to do; <span class="ital">Christ is preached</span> — And the great doctrine of salvation by him has a wider spread; <span class="ital">and I therein do rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice </span>— That is, I shall have cause so to do in regard of the good issue it will have. The love which the apostle bore to Christ, had extinguished in his mind resentment, pride, self-love, and all other evil passions; insomuch that his greatest joy resulted from the advancement of the gospel, even though it was promoted by his enemies. We must observe, however, that though <span class="ital">truth </span>is here opposed to <span class="ital">pretence, </span>it doth not follow that preaching Christ in pretence means preaching false doctrine concerning him. For the apostle could not rejoice that Christ was preached in that manner. Truth and pretence here relate not so much to the matters preached, as to the views of the preachers. The Judaizers preached the truth concerning Christ, at least in part, when they affirmed him to be the Jewish Messiah. But they did this not purely and sincerely to bring the Jews to believe on him, but also and especially to inculcate at the same time the Jewish ceremonies, and thereby to extend the authority of their ritual law; and by these means ultimately to grieve the apostle, and render his persecutors more bitter against him. But others both preached Christ as the Jewish Messiah, and also inculcated all the great doctrines of his gospel, truly and sincerely intending to bring both Jews and Gentiles to believe aright in him, and to embrace his gospel in its purity. But from whatever motive Christ was preached, according to his true character, it was matter of joy to the apostle. <span class="ital">For I know that this — </span>Preaching of Christ, whether from a pure motive or otherwise, or this trouble which I meet with from some of these teachers; <span class="ital">shall turn to my salvation </span>— Namely, to the promotion of it, or shall procure me a higher degree of glory; <span class="ital">through your prayer </span>— Continuing to be addressed to God for me; <span class="ital">and the supply of the Spirit of Christ </span>— More largely communicated to me in answer to it, and enabling me to make a good use of these trials. <span class="ital">According to my earnest expectation </span>— According to what I have all along earnestly hoped for; <span class="ital">that in nothing I shall be ashamed </span>— Whatever injurious reflections may be cast on my conduct; <span class="ital">but that with all boldness</span> — Bearing testimony to every truth of the gospel; <span class="ital">as always </span>— Since my call to the apostleship; <span class="ital">so now Christ shall be magnified </span>— Shall be honoured, and the interest of his kingdom promoted; <span class="ital">in my body, </span>however it be disposed of, <span class="ital">whether by </span>preserving its <span class="ital">life, or </span>allowing it to be put to <span class="ital">death </span>— For the confirmation of the gospel. How that might be, he did not yet know. For the apostles did not know all that should befall them, but were left in uncertainty with respect to many things, that they might have cause for the exercise of faith and patience. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:12-20 The apostle was a prisoner at Rome; and to take off the offence of the cross, he shows the wisdom and goodness of God in his sufferings. These things made him known, where he would never have otherwise been known; and led some to inquire after the gospel. He suffered from false friends, as well as from enemies. How wretched the temper of those who preached Christ out of envy and contention, and to add affliction to the bonds that oppressed this best of men! The apostle was easy in the midst of all. Since our troubles may tend to the good of many, we ought to rejoice. Whatever turns to our salvation, is by the Spirit of Christ; and prayer is the appointed means of seeking for it. Our earnest expectation and hope should not be to be honoured of men, or to escape the cross, but to be upheld amidst temptation, contempt, and affliction. Let us leave it to Christ, which way he will make us serviceable to his glory, whether by labour or suffering, by diligence or patience, by living to his honour in working for him, or dying to his honour in suffering for him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>What then? - What follows from this? What effect does it have on my mind? Does the fact that some preach from a spirit of envy and contention give me pain?<p>Notwithstanding every way - No matter in what way it is done. We are not to suppose, however, that Paul was indifferent as to the way in which the gospel was preached, or the spirit with which it was done; but the meaning is, that it was a matter of rejoicing that it was done at all, whatever the motives might be.<p>Whether in pretence or in truth - Whether as a mere pretext to cover up some other design, or from pure motives. Their pretence was that they preached the gospel because they believed it true and loved it; their real object was to build up a party, and to diminish the influence and authority of Paul.<p>Christ is preached - They made known the name of the Saviour, and announced that the Messiah had come. They could not go forth under any pretence as preachers, without making known some truth about the Redeemer. So now, it is hardly possible that any persons should attempt to preach, without stating some truth that would not otherwise be known. The name of a Saviour will be announced, and that will be something. Some views of his life and work will be presented, which, though they may be far enough from full views, are yet better than none. Though there may be much error in what is said, yet there will be also some truth. It would be better to have preachers that were better instructed, or that were more prudent, or that had purer motives, or that held a more perfect system, yet it is much in our world to have the name of the Redeemer announced in any way, and even to be told, in the most stammering manner, and from whatever motives, that man has a Saviour. The announcement of that fact in any way may save a soul; but ignorance of it could save none.<p>And I therein do rejoice - This is an instance of great magnanimity on the part of Paul, and nothing, perhaps, could better show his supreme love for the Saviour. Paul preached to increase his afflictions, and the tendency of that preaching was, probably, as it was designed to be, to unsettle confidence in him, and to lessen his influence. Yet this did not move him. The more important matter was secured, and Christ was made known; and if this were secured, he was willing that his own name should be cast into the shade. This may furnish valuable lessons to preachers of the gospel now:<p>(1) When we are laid aside from preaching by sickness, we should rejoice that others are in health, and are able to make the Saviour known, though we are forgotten.<p>(2) when we are unpopular and unsuccessful, we should rejoice that others are more popular and successful - for Christ is preached.<p>(3) when we have rivals, who have better plans than we for doing good, and whose labors are crowned with success, we should not be envious or jealous - for Christ is preached.<p>(4) when ministers of other denominations preach what we regard as error, and their preaching becomes popular, and is attended with success, we can find occasion to rejoice - for they preach Christ.<p>In the error we should not, we cannot rejoice; but in the fact that the great truth is held up that Christ died for people, we can always find abundant occasion for joy. Mingled as it may be with error, it may be nevertheless the means of saving souls, and though we should rejoice more if the truth were preached without any admixture of error, yet still the very fact that Christ is made known lays the foundation for gratitude and rejoicing. If all Christians and Christian ministers had the feelings which Paul expresses here, there would be much less envy and uncharitableness than there is now in the churches. May we not hope that the time will yet come when all who preach the gospel will have such supreme regard for the name and work of the Saviour, that they will find sincere joy in the success of a rival denomination, or a rival preacher, or in rival plans for doing good? Then, indeed, contentions would cease, and the hearts of Christians, "like kindred drops," would mingle into one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. What follows from this? Does this trouble me as they thought it would? "Notwithstanding" their unkind thought to me, and self-seeking intention, the cause I have at heart is furthered "every way" of preaching, "whether in pretense (with a by motive, Php 1:16) or in truth (out of true 'love' to Christ, Php 1:17), Christ is proclaimed; and therein I do rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice." From this it would seem that these self-seeking teachers in the main "proclaimed Christ," not "another Gospel," such as the Judaizers in Galatia taught (Ga 1:6-8); though probably having some of the Jewish leaven (see on [2381]Php 1:15,16), their chief error was their self-seeking envious motive, not so much error of doctrine; had there been vital error, Paul would not have rejoiced. The proclamation of Christ," however done, roused attention, and so was sure to be of service. Paul could thus rejoice at the good result of their bad intentions (Ps 76:10; Isa 10:5, 7).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretence, or in, truth, Christ is preached:</span> q.d.

There is one respect in which it matters; it promotes the diffusion of the Gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>R.V. reads, <span class="bld">only that</span>; an elliptical phrase, for “only I must confess that,” or the like. The documentary evidence for the word “<span class="ital">that</span>” is strong, but not decisive.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">pretence</span>] The Judaists would “pretend,” perhaps even to themselves, that their energy came of pure zeal for God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">preached</span>] Better, <span class="bld">proclaimed</span>.

He is assured that the future will only bring fresh reasons for rejoicing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>No long comment is needed on the noble spiritual lesson of this verse. The interests of his Lord are his own, and in that fact, realized by the grace of God, he finds, amidst circumstances extremely vexatious in themselves, more than equanimity—positive happiness. Self has yielded the inner throne to Christ, and the result is a Divine harmony between circumstances and self, as both are seen equally subject to Him and contributing to His ends.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-18.htm" title="What then? notwithstanding, every way, whether in pretense, or in truth, Christ is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yes, and will rejoice.">Php 1:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τί γὰρ</span>, <span class="ital">what then?</span>) What does it matter?

(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm">Acts 20:23</a>). What is the result of all this preaching? Only that Christ is announced, that the story of Christ is told. The motives of the preachers may not be good, but the result is good; the gospel facts are made more widely known, not only by those who preach in sincerity, but even by means of those who strive to promote their own party ends under the pretense of preaching Christ. <span class="cmt_word">And I therein do rejoice, yea, and will rejoice</span>. St. Paul rejoices in the good which God brings out of evil; though that good is produced by the outward agency of his own adversaries. <span class="accented">Yea</span>, <span class="accented">and I shall rejoice.</span> He will not allow himself to be vexed by the bitterness of his opponents, he will not imitate their party spirit; his joy will continue, for he knows that, in spite of present hindrances, the result is assured. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>What then?<p>Such being the case, how does it affect me?<p>Notwithstanding (&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Read &#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; except that.
