It is used both of blessing beyond strict necessity, and of service beyond legal duty; in both of which there is ground for joy and thankfulness. This is, perhaps, best seen in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/9-15.htm" title="But I have used none of these things: neither have I written these things, that it should be so done to me: for it were better for me to die, than that any man should make my glorying void.">1Corinthians 9:15-18</a>, where he declares that the simple preaching of the gospel is “nothing to boast of,” but that the preaching it without cost is “the boasting,” of which he says that he would “rather die than that any man should make it void.” (Comp. also the use of the same word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm" title="Holding forth the word of life; that I may rejoice in the day of Christ, that I have not run in vain, neither labored in vain.">Philippians 2:16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm" title="For if Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory; but not before God.">Romans 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good. Know you not that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?">1Corinthians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2Corinthians 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-12.htm" title="For we commend not ourselves again to you, but give you occasion to glory on our behalf, that you may have somewhat to answer them which glory in appearance, and not in heart.">2Corinthians 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-3.htm" title="Yet have I sent the brothers, lest our boasting of you should be in vain in this behalf; that, as I said, you may be ready:">2Corinthians 9:3</a>.) Here, therefore, St. Paul speaks of them as having in him, and in their connection with him, a cause of boasting, or rejoicing, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-14.htm" title="As also you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your rejoicing, even as you also are our's in the day of the Lord Jesus.">2Corinthians 1:14</a> (“We are your rejoicing, even as ye also are ours”), and declares that this will become “more abundant” by his coming to them again.<p><span class= "bld">In Jesus Christ for me.</span>—The original runs, “in Christ Jesus <span class= "ital">in</span> me.” The parallelism is instructive: all Christian rejoicing, or confidence, is primarily “in Christ Jesus,” even if it be secondarily “in” His servants. The suggestion of this idea here softens the apparent self-consciousness of the previous words. Comp., in 2 Corinthians 11, 12, his declaration of reluctance and distaste for the “boasting” of his apostolic authority and work, which was forced upon him.<p><span class= "bld">By my coming to you again.</span>—See in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1Timothy 1:3</a> the evidence of the fulfilment of this confident expectation.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ - Through the mercy and grace of Christ, If he was spared, his deliverance would be traced to Christ, and they would rejoice together in one who had so mercifully delivered him.<p>For me by my coming to you again - Their joy would not only be that he was delivered, but that he was permitted to see them again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26. Translate, "That your matter of glorying (or rejoicing) may abound in Christ Jesus in me (that is, in my case; in respect to me, or for me who have been granted to your prayers, Php 1:19) through my presence again among you." Alford makes the "matter of glorying," the possession of the Gospel, received from Paul, which would abound, be assured and increased, by his presence among them; thus, "in me," implies that Paul is the worker of the material of abounding in Christ Jesus. But "my rejoicing over you" (Php 2:16), answers plainly to "your rejoicing in respect to me" here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Here, in confidence of being again with them, and staying with them, he expresseth an admirable affection to them, that he can be content for a time to be deprived of the glorious sight of Christ, that he might see and serve them, and that under persecution; that they might, upon his return to them, more abundantly glory together, not in themselves, but, Christian-like, in Christ Jesus, the author of that doctrine he had preached to them, the Captain of their salvation, and the common Head of Christianity. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/philippians/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That your rejoicing may be more abundant,.... They had rejoiced greatly on his account already, blessing God that ever they had seen his face, or heard his voice; as they had great reason to do, he being the happy instrument of first bringing the Gospel to them, and of their conversion; and now he hoped he should be delivered out of prison, and see them again, that their joy might be increased and abound yet more and more, upon his deliverance, they had so earnestly prayed and so much longed for, and at the sight of him they so dearly loved: and yet to show that this their joy was not looked upon by him as a carnal one, or as arising from a natural affection, he observes that it was <p>in Jesus Christ; though they rejoiced in him as an instrument, and therefore he adds, <p>for me; yet it was on account of Jesus Christ, the subject of his ministry; their joy did not centre in the apostle, but had Christ for its object, whose person, righteousness, and salvation were held forth by him to their view and comfort; and though they would still more and more rejoice should he return to them once more, <p>by my coming to you again; yet still it would he in Christ, and because of the fulness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ, in which he should come to them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philippians/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm" title="That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.">Php 1:26</a>. “In order that your ground of glorying may increase in Christ Jesus through me, by reason of my,” etc. Their <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span> is their knowledge and possession of the Gospel.

The Greek word is a favourite with St Paul, especially in the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians. This fact is an item in the evidence for the time of writing of this Epistle. See Introduction, p. 14.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">may be more abundant</span>] On the Greek word thus rendered we may make the same remark precisely as on “glorying”; see last note.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in Jesus Christ</span>] Read, with all the evidence, <span class="bld">in Christ Jesus</span>; and see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a> above.—Observe here, as so often (see above, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>), how the whole action of the Christian’s life is carried on “<span class="ital">in</span> Christ.” This glad exultant pleasure, this “glorying,” was to be experienced as by men in vital union with their Lord by the Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for me</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">in me</span>.—Here, on the other hand, “<span class="ital">in</span>” bears its frequent meaning of “<span class="ital">in the case of</span>,” “<span class="ital">on occasion of</span>.” Cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm" title="And they glorified God in me.">Galatians 1:24</a> (<span class="ital">not</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-16.htm" title="To reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the heathen; immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood:">Galatians 1:16</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/1-4.htm" title="So that we ourselves glory in you in the churches of God for your patience and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations that you endure:">2 Thessalonians 1:4</a>, a close parallel. This change of interpretation of the same preposition in one passage is not arbitrary. The phrase “<span class="ital">in Christ</span>” is, so to speak, <span class="ital">stereotyped;</span> not so this latter.—St Paul was to be their occasion for “glorying,” as a living example of the Lord’s faithfulness and love, restoring him to the needing disciples.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">by my coming to you</span>] R.V., “<span class="ital">through my presence with you</span>.” Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">through my coming to you</span>. The word (<span class="ital">parousia</span>) rendered “coming” is lit. “presence”; but by usage it very frequently means “coming to be present,” as especially in the case of the “Parousia” of the Lord at the Great Day.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm" title="That your rejoicing may be more abundant in Jesus Christ for me by my coming to you again.">Php 1:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Τὸ καύχημα ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">your glorying</span> [rejoicing]) concerning my restoration to you, who were praying for that very thing.
