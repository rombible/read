For, as he said to the elders of the church at Ephesus, he foresaw that <span class="ital">after his departure grievous wolves should enter into </span>the churches, <span class="ital">not sparing the flock, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>. This is the other particular between which, and departing to be with Christ, the apostle’s mind was divided, as mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>. For the sake of the churches, however, he here represents himself as being willing to forego, for a time, his own interest, and to continue in this mortal state. For he adds, <span class="ital">having this confidence </span>— That my abiding in the flesh is for your advantage; <span class="ital">I know that I shall abide — </span>Some have supposed that a particular revelation was made to him, while he was writing this, that he should not be put to death at this time, but should soon be released from his bonds; and that it was on the ground of that revelation that he expressed himself with so much confidence on this occasion. Some indeed have thought that this hope of deliverance arose from his knowing that the Christians in Cesar’s household were now endeavouring to procure his release. But, as Dr. Doddridge observes, “he must have known little of princes and courtiers, (and especially in Nero’s reign,) to build so confidently on such a foundation.” <span class="ital">And continue with you all </span>— Which doubtless he did for some considerable time, visiting many other places as well as Philippi. <span class="ital">For your furtherance </span>— <span class="greekheb">Προκοπην</span>, <span class="ital">advancement, </span>in holiness; <span class="ital">and the joy of faith </span>— Which will be strengthened by my deliverance from confinement, and by my continuing my apostolical labours among you as opportunity offers. <span class="ital">That your rejoicing — </span>Or <span class="ital">glorying, </span>as <span class="greekheb">καυχημα </span>rather signifies; <span class="ital">may be more abundant </span>— May be greatly increased; <span class="ital">by my coming to you again </span>— As I fully expect to do.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:21-26 Death is a great loss to a carnal, worldly man, for he loses all his earthly comforts and all his hopes; but to a true believer it is gain, for it is the end of all his weakness and misery. It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Nevertheless to abide in the flesh - To live.

He never supposed that his life was useless; or that it was a matter of no importance to the cause of religion whether he lived or died. He knew that God works by means; and that the life of a minister of the gospel is of real value to the church and the world. His experience, his influence, his paternal counsels, he felt assured would be of value to the church, and he had, therefore, a desire to live - and it was no part of his religion affectedly to undervalue or despise himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24. to abide&#8212;to continue somewhat longer.<p>for you&#8212;Greek, "on your account"; "for your sake."

The Syriac version renders the words thus, "but business for you", or "a good will towards you compels me to abide in the body"; and the Arabic version thus, "notwithstanding I choose to remain in the flesh, and this I think very necessary for you"; so that upon the whole, the argument for living longer on consideration of glorifying Christ, and of being more useful to the good of souls, preponderated with him; inclined him to desire rather to live than die; though the latter was better for him, and more to his personal advantage; and thus, like a brave and good man, he prefers a public good to a private one. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.">Php 1:24</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπιμένειν</span> involves the idea: to remain <span class="ital">still</span> (still further), <span class="ital">to stay on</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then?
