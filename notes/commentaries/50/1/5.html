Accordingly St. Paul must be taken here to mean the fellow-working of the Philippians in the ministry of the gospel, of which he speaks still more distinctly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Philippians 1:7</a>.

And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For your fellowship in the gospel - "For your liberality toward me, a preacher of the gospel." - Wetstein. There has been, however, no little difference of opinion about the meaning of this phrase. Many - as Doddridge, Koppe, and others - suppose it refers to the fact that they participated in the blessings of the gospel from the first day that he preached it until the time when he wrote this Epistle. Others suppose that it refers to their constancy in the Christian faith. Others - as Pierce, Michaelis, Wetstein, Bloomfield, and Storr - suppose it refers to their liberality in contributing to the support of the gospel; to their participating with others, or sharing what they had in common with others, for the maintenance of the gospel. That this is the true sense seems apparent:<p>(1) because it accords with the scope of the Epistle, and what the apostle elsewhere says of their benefactions. He speaks particularly of their liberality, and indeed this was one of the principal occasions of his writing the Epistle; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10-12</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15-18</a>.<p>(2) it accords with a frequent meaning of the word rendered "fellowship" - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  koino&#772;nia. It denotes that which is in common; that of which we participate with others, communion, fellowship; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm">Acts 2:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-9.htm">1 Corinthians 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm">1 Corinthians 10:16</a>; Plm 1:6; then it means communication, distribution, contribution; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-13.htm">2 Corinthians 9:13</a>. That it cannot mean "accession to the gospel" as has been supposed (see Robinson's Lexicon), is apparent from what he adds - "from the first day until now." The fellowship must have been something constant, and continually manifest - and the general meaning is, that in relation to the gospel - to its support, and privileges, and spirit, they all shared in common. They felt a common interest in every thing that pertained to it, and they showed this in every suitable way, and especially in ministering to the wants of those who were appointed to preach it.<p>From the first day - The time when it was first preached to them. They had been constant. This is honorable testimony. It is much to say of a church or of an individual Christian, that they have been constant and uniform in the requirements of the gospel. Alas, of how few can this be said. On these verses <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3-5</a> we may remark:<p>(1) That one of the highest joys which a minister of the gospel can have, is that furnished by the holy walk of the people to whom he has ministered; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-4.htm">3 John 1:4</a>. It is joy like that of a farmer when he sees his fields ripe for a rich harvest; like that of a teacher in the good conduct and rapid progress of his scholars; like that of a parent in the virtue, success, and piety of his sons. Yet it is superior to all that. The interests are higher and more important; the results are more far-reaching and pure; and the joy is more disinterested. Probably there is nowhere else on earth any happiness so pure, elevated, consoling, and rich, as that of a pastor in the piety, peace, benevolence, and growing zeal of his people.<p>(2) it is right to commend Christians when they do well. Paul never hesitated to do this, and never supposed that it would do injury. Flattery would injure - but Paul never flattered. Commendation or praise, in order to do good, and not to injure, should be:<p>(a) the simple statement of the truth;<p>(b) it should be without exaggeration;<p>(c) it should be connected with an equal readiness to rebuke when wrong; to admonish when in error, and to counsel when one goes astray.<p>Constant fault-finding, scolding, or fretfulness, does no good in a family, a school, or a church. The tendency is to dishearten, irritate, and discourage. To commend a child when he does well, may be as important, and as much a duty, as to rebuke him when he does ill. God is as careful to commend his people when they do well, as he is to rebuke them when they do wrong - and that parent, teacher, or pastor, has much mistaken the path of wisdom, who supposes it to be his duty always to find fault. In this world there is nothing that goes so far in promoting happiness as a willingness to be pleased rather than displeased to be satisfied rather than dissatisfied with the conduct of others.<p>(3) our absent friends should be remembered in our prayers. On our knees before God is the best place to remember them. We know not their condition. If they are sick, we cannot minister to their needs; if in danger, we cannot run to their relief; if tempted, we cannot counsel them. But God, who is with them, car do all this; and it is an inestimable privilege thus to be permitted to commend them to his holy care and keeping. Besides, it is a duty to do it. It is one way - and the best way - to repay their kindness. A child may always be repaying the kindness of absent parents by supplicating the divine blessing on them each morning; and a brother may strengthen and continue his love for a sister, and in part repay her tender love, by seeking, when far away, the divine favor to be bestowed on her. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. Ground of his "thanking God" (Php 1:3): "For your (continued) fellowship (that is, real spiritual participation) in (literally, 'in regard to') the Gospel from the first day (of your becoming partakers in it) until now." Believers have the fellowship of the Son of God (1Co 1:9) and of the Father (1Jo 1:3) in the Gospel, by becoming partakers of "the fellowship of the Holy Ghost" (2Co 13:14), and exercise that fellowship by acts of communion, not only the communion of the Lord's Supper, but holy liberality to brethren and ministers (Php 4:10, 15, "communicated &#8230; concerning giving"; 2Co 9:13; Ga 6:6; Heb 13:16, "To communicate forget not").<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Your being joined with us and other Christians in the communion of Christ, and glad tidings of salvation by him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-16.htm" title="The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ?

Or "for your communication unto the Gospel"; that is, to the support of it. These Philippians were one of the churches of Macedonia the apostle so highly commends for their liberality in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/8-1.htm">2 Corinthians 8:1</a>; they had been very communicative to him, and those that were with him, from the beginning of the Gospel being preached to them: as the instances of Lydia and the jailer show, and which are taken notice of in this epistle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm">Philippians 4:15</a>; And this same generous spirit still continued, of which their present by Epaphroditus was an evidence; and for this the apostle gives thanks, not only that they had an ability to support the Gospel, and assist Gospel ministers, but that they were willing to communicate, and did communicate, readily and cheerfully, largely and liberally; or this may intend their "participation in the Gospel", as the Arabic version renders it. The Gospel was in a very wonderful and providential manner brought unto them, and it was attended with mighty power to the conversion of them; they received it with joy and gladness, and cheerfully submitted to the ordinances of it; they had much light into it, and spiritual knowledge of it; and were made partakers of the blessings of grace, which are revealed and exhibited in it, and of the exceeding great and precious promises of it, for which the apostle gives thanks to God; for all this was from him, and a wonderful instance of his grace it was. Moreover, through the Gospel being thus brought unto them, and succeeded among them, they became a Gospel church, and had, through the Gospel, and the ordinances of it, fellowship one with another; yea, they had fellowship with the Father, and his Son Jesus Christ, unto which they were called by the Gospel; and in this they remained <p>from the first day until now; they continued in the Gospel which they were made partakers of, and in fellowship with one another, in breaking of bread, and in prayer, and in hearing the word, which they constantly attended to, and were blessed with communion with Father, Son, and Spirit, to that time; and therefore the apostle continued from the first of their receiving the Gospel, to that moment, to give thanks to God for them on that account: for this last clause may be connected with the words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm">Philippians 1:3</a>, "I thank my God", as well as with those immediately preceding, "your fellowship in the Gospel"; and shows not only their perseverance in the Gospel, from the first to the present time, as the Ethiopic version renders it, for which he was abundantly thankful; but the continuance of his thankfulness on that account, from his first acquaintance with them to that time. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For your <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> fellowship in the gospel from the <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> first day until now;</span><p>(b) Because you also are made partakers of the Gospel.<p>(c) Ever since I knew you.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm" title="For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;">Php 1:5</a> f. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπὶ τῇ κοινων</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ εὐαγγ</span>.] is to be taken together with <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;">1 Corinthians 1:4</a>), and not with <span class="greekheb">μετὰ χαρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. (Calvin, Grotius, van Hengel, de Wette, Ewald, Weiss, Hofmann); for in that case, with the right explanation of <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ πάσῃ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μν</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>., the specification of the ground for thanks would be entirely wanting, or would at all events result only indirectly, namely, as object of the <span class="ital">joy. On account of your fellowship in respect of the gospel;</span> by this Paul means the <span class="ital">common brotherly coherence</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>) which united the Philippians <span class="ital">together for the gospel</span> (as the aim to which the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> <span class="ital">has reference</span>), that is, for its furtherance and efficiency. The great cause of the gospel was the end at which, in their mutual coherence, they aimed; and this, therefore, gave to their fellowship with one another its specific character of a holy destination. The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by the context in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Php 1:9</a>, where that which is here expressed by <span class="greekheb">ἡ κοινωνία ὑμῶν</span> is characterized, under the category of the <span class="ital">disposition</span> on which this <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> is based, as <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη ὑμῶν</span>. As this view is in full harmony with both words and sense, and is not dependent on anything to be supplied, it excludes divergent interpretations. We must therefore reject not only the explanation which refers <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> to the <span class="ital">aid</span> sent to Paul (Zeger, Cornelius a Lapide, Estius, Wetstein, Michaelis, Bisping, and others), so that it is to be taken actively as <span class="ital">communication</span> (see Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Rom</span>. III. p. 81, 287), although it is never so used in the N. T. (comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-26.htm" title="For it has pleased them of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor saints which are at Jerusalem.">Romans 15:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-6.htm" title="Let him that is taught in the word communicate to him that teaches in all good things.">Galatians 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-6.htm" title="That the communication of your faith may become effectual by the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in Christ Jesus.">Philemon 1:6</a>), but also the view of Theodoret, Luther, Beza, Calvin, Grotius, Heinrichs, and others: “<span class="ital">quod evangelii participes facti estis,</span>” as if it ran <span class="greekheb">τοῦ εὐαγγελίου</span> (Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">κοινωνίαν δὲ τοῦ εὐαγγελίου τὴν πίστιν ἐκάλεσε</span>). Chrysostom and Theophylact, who are followed by most of the recent interpreters (including Schinz, Weiss, Schenkel, Huther, Ellicott, J. B. Lightfoot, Hofmann), understand the fellowship of the Philippians <span class="ital">with the apostle</span>, that is, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κοινωνοί μου γίνεσθε κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">συμμερισταὶ τῶν ἐπὶ τῷ εὐαγγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πόνων</span>, Theophylact; consequently, their <span class="ital">co-operation with him</span> in spreading the gospel, in which case also a reference to the aid rendered is included. In this case, since the text says nothing about a “<span class="ital">service</span>” devoted to the gospel (Hofmann), an addition like <span class="greekheb">μετʼ ἐμοῦ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-3.htm" title="That which we have seen and heard declare we to you, that you also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.">1 John 1:3</a>, <span class="ital">et al.</span>), or some other more precise definition, like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>, would be an essential element—not arising (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>) out of the context—which therefore must have been <span class="ital">expressed</span>, as indeed Paul must have <span class="ital">said</span> so, had he wished to be understood as referring to fellowship <span class="ital">with all who had the cause of the gospel at heart</span> (Wiesinger). The <span class="ital">absolute</span> “your fellowship,” if no arbitrary supplement is allowable, can only mean <span class="ital">the mutual fellowship</span> of the <span class="ital">members of the church themselves</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">article</span> is not repeated after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>, because <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία εἰς τὸ εὐαγγ</span>. is conceived as forming a single notion (comp. on <span class="greekheb">κοινωνεῖν εἰς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only.">Php 4:15</a>; Plato, <span class="ital">Rep</span>. p. 453 A).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ πρώτης ἡμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄχρι τοῦ νῦν</span>] is <span class="ital">usually</span> connected with <span class="greekheb">τῇ κοινωνίᾳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. This connection is the <span class="ital">true one</span>, for the <span class="ital">constancy</span> of the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, that has been attested hitherto, is the very thing which not only supplies the motive for the apostle’s thankfulness, but forms also the ground of his just confidence for the future. The connective article (<span class="greekheb">τῇ</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ</span>) is not requisite, as <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ ὑμῶν</span> was construed as <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῷ κοινωνεῖν ὑμᾶς</span> (Winer, p. 128 [E. T. 171]). It cannot be connected with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δέησιν ποιούμ</span>.

If joined with <span class="greekheb">πεποιθώς</span> (Rilliet, following Lachmann, ed. min.), it would convey an emphatically prefixed definition of the apostle’s confidence, whereas the whole context concerns the previous <span class="ital">conduct of the readers</span>, which by the connection with <span class="greekheb">πεποιθ</span>. would be but indirectly indicated. If connected with <span class="greekheb">εὐχαριστῶ</span> (Beza, Wolf, Bengel), the words—seeing that the expression <span class="greekheb">πάντοτε ἐν πάσῃ δεήσει</span> has already been used, and then in <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ κοινωνίᾳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. a transition has already been made to the object of the thanks—would contain a definition awkwardly postponed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">first</span> day is that in which he first preached the gospel to them, which was followed by immediate and decided results, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-13.htm" title="And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spoke to the women which resorted thither.">Acts 16:13</a> ff.

Now he gives the reason for his joy.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ κοινωνίᾳ</span>. At the first glance <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. seems to refer to their mutual fellowship and harmony as Christians. A closer examination reveals that this whole passage is concerned with Paul’s personal relation to them.

This really includes the idea of united action on the one hand, and the concrete expression of their helpfulness, their gift to the Apostle, on the other. Hort (<span class="ital">Christian Ecclesia</span>, p. 44) points out that there is something concrete in the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-42.htm" title="And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers.">Acts 2:42</a>.
