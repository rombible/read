It rests indeed upon the sense that it is a privilege to suffer (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>) in the cause of truth, yet still more on the belief that such suffering is for no abstract principle, but on behalf of Christ and with Christ. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17-18</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Not only to believe . . .</span>—The original shows that St. Paul speaks as if he originally intended simply to say “it is given on behalf of Christ to suffer.” But to show whence the impulse of that brave willingness to suffer proceeds, he inserts “not only to believe on Him,” and then finishes the sentence, “but on His behalf to suffer.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;...">Php 1:29-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">For unto you it is given </span>— <span class="greekheb">Εχαρισθη</span>, <span class="ital">it is granted as a favour, in the behalf of Christ, </span>on account of his merits and intercession, and for the promotion of his cause and interest, <span class="ital">not only to believe on him, </span>(faith itself, as well as Christ and his truth, the objects of it, being the free gift of God,) <span class="ital">but also to suffer for his sake </span>— This, as well as your faith, and the blessings which you receive by faith, is granted you as a special token of God’s love to you, and of your being in the way of salvation. The apostle wished the Philippians to consider their sufferings for Christ as an honour, and an important means of good, and to rejoice in them. Thus it is said of Peter and John, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; <span class="ital">They departed from the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name. Having the same </span>kind of <span class="ital">conflict </span>with your adversaries. The word <span class="greekheb">αγωνα</span>, here rendered <span class="ital">conflict, </span>is the general name by which the Greeks expressed all the different combats in their games. And because in these contests the contenders struggled long and hard for victory, the word was applied to express any sort of trial or trouble, to which men exposed themselves in the course of their pursuits: <span class="ital">which ye saw in me </span>when I was with you, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-12.htm" title="And from there to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days....">Acts 16:12-19</a>, &c. For the apostle seems principally to allude to the conflict which he sustained at Philippi, on account of the damsel out of whom he had cast the spirit of divination, and whose masters got him scourged, and put in the stocks. Besides this, however, on his second coming to Philippi, after his long residence at Ephesus, he suffered other afflictions, of which the Philippians also were witnesses, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-5.htm" title="For, when we were come into Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were troubled on every side; without were fights, within were fears.">2 Corinthians 7:5</a>. <span class="ital">And now hear to be in me </span>— It seems the Philippians had received an account from some of the brethren, who had come from Rome to Philippi, of the apostle’s present conflict with the unbelieving Jews, the Judaizing teachers, and the heathen magistrates. A similar conflict the Philippians themselves sustained, being persecuted for the gospel, and their bitterest persecutors being their own countrymen. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:27-30 Those who profess the gospel of Christ, should live as becomes those who believe gospel truths, submit to gospel laws, and depend upon gospel promises. The original word conversation denotes the conduct of citizens who seek the credit, safety, peace, and prosperity of their city. There is that in the faith of the gospel, which is worth striving for; there is much opposition, and there is need of striving. A man may sleep and go to hell; but he who would go to heaven, must look about him and be diligent. There may be oneness of heart and affection among Christians, where there is diversity of judgment about many things. Faith is God's gift on the behalf of Christ; the ability and disposition to believe are from God. And if we suffer reproach and loss for Christ, we are to reckon them a gift, and prize them accordingly. Yet salvation must not be ascribed to bodily afflictions, as though afflictions and worldly persecutions deserved it; but from God only is salvation: faith and patience are his gifts.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For unto you - Unto you as Christians. This favor is granted unto you in your present circumstances.<p>It is given - God concedes to you this privilege or advantage.<p>In the behalf of Christ - In the cause of Christ, or with a view to honor Christ. Or, these things are brought on you in consequence of your being Christians.<p>Not only to believe on him - It is represented here as a privilege to be permitted to believe on Christ. It is so:<p>(1) It is an honor to a man to believe one who ought to be believed, to trust one who ought to be trusted, to love one who ought to be loved.<p>(2) it is a privilege to believe on Christ, because it is by such faith that out sins are forgiven; that we become reconciled to God, and have the hope of heaven.<p>(3) it is a privilege, because it saves the mind from the tortures and the deadly influence of unbelief - the agitation, and restlessness, and darkness, and gloom of a skeptic.<p>(4) it is a privilege, because we have then a friend to whom we may go in trial, and on whom we may roll all our burdens. If there is anything for which a Christian ought to give unfeigned thanks, it is that he has been permitted to believe on the Redeemer. Let a sincere Christian compare his peace, and joy, and hope of heaven, and support in trials, with the restlessness, uneasiness, and dread of death, in the mind of an unbeliever; and he will see abundant occasion for gratitude.<p>But also to suffer for his sake - Here it is represented as a privilege to suffer in the cause of the Redeemer - a declaration which may sound strange to the world. Yet this sentiment frequently occurs in the New Testament. Thus, it is said of the apostles Act 5:41, that "they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm">Colossians 1:24</a>. "Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-13.htm">1 Peter 4:13</a>. "But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's sufferings;" compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-2.htm">James 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/10-30.htm">Mark 10:30</a>; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm">Acts 5:41</a>. It is a privilege thus to suffer in the cause of Christ:<p>(1) because we then resemble the Lord Jesus, and are united with him in trials;<p>(2) because we have evidence that we are his, if trials come upon us in his cause;<p>(3) because we are engaged in a good cause, and the privilege of maintaining such a cause is worth much of suffering; and,<p>(4) because it will be connected with a brighter crown and more exalted honor in heaven. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>29.

For the sake of his Gospel, for the good of his interest, and the glory of his name. The Alexandrian copy reads, "to us it is given", &amp;c, <p>not only to believe in him; for faith in Christ, which is not merely believing that he is the Christ, and all that is said of him, or all that he himself says, but is a seeing of the Son, a going to him, receiving, embracing, leaning, relying, and living upon him, as God's salvation, is a pure gift of grace; it is not in nature, nor in every man, and in whom it is, it is not of themselves, it is the gift of God; the first implantation of it, all its acts and exercise, its increase, and the performance of it at last with power, are all owing to the grace of God; and this is only given to the elect, for it is a distinguishing gift; it is given to them, and them alone, and, therefore called the faith of God's elect: <p>but also to suffer for his sake; for the sake of Christ personal; for the sake of Christ mystical, for his body's sake the church; for the sake of his Gospel, and for the sake of his cause and interest in the world: now to suffer in name and character, in estate or person, not as an evildoer, but as a Christian, is a gift of God, as faith in Christ is; all the sufferings of the saints are appointed by God; their being called forth to suffer shame for the sake of Christ, is an high honour conferred upon them; all the grace and strength by which they are supported under sufferings for Christ are given to them; and all the glory consequent upon them is not merited by them, which are by no meant to be compared with it, but is the free gift of God through Christ. The same persons to whom it is given to believe in Christ, to them it is given to suffer for him; and they all do in some shape or another, though some more, others less; yet all are partakers of sufferings for Christ, and so are conformed to him their head, and hereby enter the kingdom: now all this is said, as containing so many reasons to encourage believers to have their conversation as becomes the Gospel of Christ, by a steady adherence to it, and a joint contention and striving for it, without being intimidated by their enemies. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{10}</span> For unto you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;</span><p>(10) He proves his statement that persecution is a token of our salvation, because it is a gift of God to suffer for Christ, which gift he bestows upon his own, as he does the gift of faith.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-29.htm" title="For to you it is given in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer for his sake;">Php 1:29</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὅτι</span> is argumentative. “<span class="greekheb">Καὶ τοῦτο ἀπὸ Θεοῦ</span>,” I say, “<span class="ital">since indeed to you</span> it was <span class="ital">granted,</span>” etc. This grant distinguishing <span class="ital">you</span> is the practical proof, that the just expressed <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ</span> is indubitably right, and that consequently the <span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span> of your final salvation which is afforded to the adversaries in your undauntedness is a <span class="ital">divine</span> <span class="greekheb">ἔνδειξις</span>, <span class="ital">a token given by God</span>.[83] Hofmann’s view, that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> specifies the reason why God imparts to them what has been before stated, is based upon the erroneous reading <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm" title="And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.">Php 1:28</a>; and is itself erroneous, because <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> would introduce merely the self-evident thought that they had <span class="ital">not sought out</span> their suffering <span class="ital">wilfully</span>, but had had it given to them <span class="ital">by God</span>, and because, for the purpose of marking the alleged contrast to the wilfulness, not <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, but <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ</span> again would have been emphatically prefixed, and consequently Paul must have written: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἀπὸ Θεοῦ ὑμῖν ἐχαρίσθη κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Hofmann curiously explains the emphasized <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span>, as if Paul meant to say that with respect to their sufferings <span class="ital">the case stood exactly as with his own</span>.

The apostle does not leave this unwritten purposely, in order to bring into prominence in the first place the idea of <span class="greekheb">ὑπέρ</span>, as Hofmann artificially explains. But here his full heart interposes, after <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ</span>, and before he writes <span class="greekheb">πάσχειν</span>, the fresh thought <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον τὸ εἰς αὐτ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span>, so that <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ καὶ</span> must now be also added; and, on account of the different prepositional relation (<span class="greekheb">εἰς</span>) introduced, the <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ</span> already expressed is again taken up by <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ</span>. Thus <span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον</span> … <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ αὐτοῦ</span> appears as a parenthesis of more special definition, after which the <span class="greekheb">πάσχειν</span>, which had been prepared for by <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπὲρ Χριστοῦ</span>, but is only now introduced, is to be dwelt upon with emphasis: “<span class="ital">to you the gift of grace is granted, in behalf of Christ</span>—not only to believe on Him, but also for Him—<span class="ital">to suffer</span>.” Plat. <span class="ital">Legg</span>. x. p. 802 C: <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ φανήσεται ψυχὴ πρῶτον</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ πῦρ οὐδὲ ἀὴρ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ψυχὴ δὲ ἐν πρώτοις γεγενημένη</span>. See also Dissen, <span class="ital">ad Dem. de cor</span>. p. 431; Fritzsche, <span class="ital">ad Matth</span>. p. 501.

For the conception of <span class="ital">suffering</span> for Christ as a high divine <span class="ital">distinction</span>, see already <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-41.htm" title="And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name.">Acts 5:41</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a> f.

We are inclined to join this clause immediately to <span class="greekheb">μὴ πτυρόμενοι</span> (so also Hpt[81]). The prospect of suffering was apt to terrify them.

The Apostle intended to insert <span class="greekheb">πάσχειν</span> after <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>., but for a moment he pauses. To emphasise the real value of suffering for Christ’s sake, he compares it with that which they all acknowledge as the crowning blessing of their lives, faith in Him. As to the form of the sentence, this is a favourite rhetorical device of Paul’s. See J. Weiss, <span class="ital">Beiträge</span>, p. 11 <span class="ital">n.</span>—<span class="greekheb">οὐ μόνον</span>. <span class="greekheb">μή</span> might have been expected. “When a limitation of an infinitive or of its subject is to be negatived rather than the infinitive itself, the negative <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> is used instead of <span class="greekheb">μή</span>.

Thus the word here, with its associations of sovereignty, favour, boon, forms a noble paradox.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">on the behalf of Christ</span>] The structure of the Greek indicates that the Apostle was about to write simply, “<span class="ital">it is granted you to suffer on behalf of Christ</span>”, but that he suspended the thought and phrase to insert, “<span class="ital">not only to believe on Him but</span> to suffer on His behalf.” Thus “on the behalf of Christ” anticipates here the close of the verse, where it is repeated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to believe on him</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">into Him</span>,” a phrase suggesting the directness and holdfast of saving faith. But this speciality of meaning must not be pressed far, for the phrase occurs here and there in connexions not naturally adapted to such thought; e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/2-23.htm" title="Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, in the feast day, many believed in his name, when they saw the miracles which he did.">John 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-42.htm" title="Nevertheless among the chief rulers also many believed on him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:">John 12:42</a>.—The Greek verb is in the present tense, and points to the continuousness of the action of faith. The Christian, having once believed, lives by still believing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-20.htm" title="Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and you stand by faith. Be not high minded, but fear:">Romans 11:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-38.htm" title="Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.">Hebrews 10:38</a>.—Faith in Christ is here incidentally spoken of as a grant of Divine grace.

Suffering is a gift of grace. "It is given" should be "it was given," referring to the gift bestowed when they became Christians. Suffering was the marriage-gift when they were espoused to Christ: the bounty when they enlisted in His service. Becoming one with Him they entered into the fellowship of His suffering (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). The gift was not suffering as such. Its meaning and value lay in its being for His sake. The Macedonian churches, and the Philippian church especially, were preeminently suffering churches.
