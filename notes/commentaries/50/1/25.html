It is simply, “I feel certain;” and it is obvious to remark that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm" title="And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.">Acts 20:25</a> it is used by St. Paul of a conviction (that he would “see the face” of the Ephesians “no more”) which, so far as we can follow out the history, was not verified. The apostolic inspiration, like the apostolic power of miracle, was a gift relative to the apostolic work, not necessarily extending beyond it.<p><span class= "bld">Abide and continue with you.</span>—The latter verb is in the original a compound of the former, “I shall abide,” and “shall abide side by side with you.” It was for their sakes that it was needful for him to live. Hence to the simple idea “I shall abide,” it was natural to add at once the phrase “with you,” or “for you,” as explaining the very object of his abiding in the flesh.<p><span class= "bld">For your furtherance and joy of faith.</span>—In these words St. Paul’s presence with them is spoken of, first, as in some degree necessary for their spiritual advance; next, as being to them a gift of God for their joy and comfort, even beyond what was actually necessary.

It delivers him from all the evils of life, and brings him to possess the chief good. The apostle's difficulty was not between living in this world and living in heaven; between these two there is no comparison; but between serving Christ in this world and enjoying him in another. Not between two evil things, but between two good things; living to Christ and being with him. See the power of faith and of Divine grace; it can make us willing to die. In this world we are compassed with sin; but when with Christ, we shall escape sin and temptation, sorrow and death, for ever. But those who have most reason to desire to depart, should be willing to remain in the world as long as God has any work for them to do. And the more unexpected mercies are before they come, the more of God will be seen in them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And having this confidence - "Being persuaded of this, that my continuance on earth is desirable for your welfare, and that the Lord has a work for me to do, I confidently expect that I shall be permitted to live." The "confidence" here referred to was, that his life was needful for them, and hence that God would spare him. A literal translation would be, "And being persuaded as to this, or of this" - &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf; &#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3c2;  touto pepoitho&#772;s - "I know," etc. The foundation of his expectation that he should live does not appear to have been any revelation to that effect, as Doddridge supposes; or any intimation which he had from the palace of the intentions of the government, as some others suppose, but the fact that he believed his life to be necessary for them, and that therefore God would preserve it.<p>I know that I shall abide - The word "know," however, (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;  oida) is not to be pressed as denoting absolute necessity - for it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm">Philippians 2:17</a>, that there was some ground for doubt whether he would live - but is to be taken in a popular sense, as denoting good courage, and an earnest hope that he would be permitted to live and visit them. Heinrichs.<p>And continue with you all - That is, that he would be permitted not only to live, but to enjoy their society.<p>For your furtherance and joy of faith - For the increase of your faith, and the promotion of that joy which is the consequence of faith. Wetstein has quoted a beautiful passage from Seneca (Epis. 104) which strikingly resembles this sentiment of Paul. He says that when a man had meditated death, and when on his own account he would be willing to die, yet that he ought to be willing to live - to come back again to life - for the sake of his friends. Pagan adds: "It pertains to a great mind to be willing to come back to life for the sake of others; which distinguished people often do." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.

In the flesh, in the body, live a little longer in the world. These words must be understood either of a certain infallible knowledge, arising from a divine revelation, and a firm persuasion and confidence founded upon that which the apostle had, of his being delivered from his bonds, and spared a little longer for further usefulness among the churches; and accordingly some have thought that he was after this set at liberty, and travelled through several countries preaching the Gospel, and after that was committed to prison and suffered death; but of this there is no sufficient proof: or rather therefore of a conjectural knowledge arising from the present state of things, and his view of it; being willing to hope, and persuade himself that he should be delivered from his confinement, and his life be spared for the good of the interest of Christ, and the glory of his name; it being what his heart was set upon, and he was very desirous of: <p>and continue with you all; not only with the Philippians, but other saints, and other churches, who were dear to him, and he to them; though he may mean more especially these believers: <p>for your furtherance, or "profiting"; in divine and spiritual things, in the knowledge of Christ, and the truths of the Gospel: <p>and joy of faith; for the furtherance, or increase of that joy which faith is attended with, and which springs from it; for true solid joy springs from faith in the person, blood, righteousness, and atonement of Christ; and is what may be increased, and is often done by and through the ministry of the word, and the ministers of the Gospel; who do not pretend to a dominion over the faith of men, only to be helpers of their joy, as they sometimes are, as also of their faith, which as it comes by hearing is increased the same way.

See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-23.htm" title="Are they ministers of Christ?

But in this passage also <span class="greekheb">καύχημα</span> means that <span class="ital">in which one glories</span>, as the Scholiast has appropriately explained it: <span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ τηλικαῦτα εἰσὶ τῶν Αἱγινητῶν τὰ κατορθώματα</span>, <span class="greekheb">βρίκι καὶ ἐπικάλυπτε τῇ σιωπῇ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death....">Php 1:20-26</a> we are not to conclude that Paul at that time was in doubt whether he should live to see the Parousia (Usteri, <span class="ital">Lehrbegr</span>. p. 355, and others). For in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.">Php 1:20</a> <span class="ital">he only supposes the case of</span> his death, and that indeed, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Php 1:21</a>, as the case which would be <span class="ital">profitable</span> for himself, and for which, therefore, he protests in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm" title="For I am in a strait between two, having a desire to depart, and to be with Christ; which is far better:">Php 1:23</a> <span class="ital">that he longs</span>.

There is every reason to believe that his hope was justified (see <span class="ital">Introduction</span>).—<span class="greekheb">παραμενῶ</span> (which is best attested) has in later Greek the special sense of “remaining alive”. See Schmid, <span class="ital">Atticismus</span>, i., p. 132, who quotes Dio., i., 62, 8; 333, 29; Herod., i., 30, and compares Plat., <span class="ital">Phaed.</span>, 62 [60], 86 C.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑ προκ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

We have the strongest ground, from the merely historical point of view, for saying that this expectation was verified by the event; that the Apostle was released, and enabled to revisit his missions. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1 Timothy 1:3</a> for an intimation of a visit to <span class="ital">Macedonia</span>, later in date than the writing of this passage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been asked how this “<span class="ital">I know</span>” is to be reconciled with the “I know that ye all shall <span class="ital">see my face no more</span>,” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm" title="And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.">Acts 20:25</a>. Were <span class="ital">both</span> verified by the event? We believe that they were, and that only our necessary ignorance of the history in detail makes the difficulty. We believe that the guidance of the Divine Spirit, however His action worked through a perfect freedom of mental processes in St Paul, secured the veracity of his deliberate forecasts in a way quite supernatural. But apart from this ground of inference, we think that <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm" title="And now, behold, I know that you all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom of God, shall see my face no more.">Acts 20:25</a> has natural evidences of its fulfilment. The narrative there, acts 1:37, 38, calls special and pathetic attention to the prediction; and it seems hardly credible that if it had been contradicted by events within a few years the passage should have remained intact; some sort of intimation that St Paul had after all met them again would have crept in. And we have seen that there is good evidence for the fulfilment of the present anticipation also. It seems reasonable, then, from the merely historical point of view, to assume that events did prevent an after-visit of St Paul’s to Ephesus, though he did revisit Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm" title="Erastus stayed at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum sick.">2 Timothy 4:20</a>); or at least that there was no such after-visit as allowed him to meet that body of presbyters again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and continue with you all</span>] Better, with R.V., <span class="bld">yea, and abide with you all</span>. The word “abide” is repeated: it will be not only continuance, but continuance <span class="ital">with you</span>.—Quite lit., “abide <span class="ital">by</span> you all”; as <span class="ital">side by side</span> in Christian life and labour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">furtherance</span>] R.V., <span class="bld">progress</span>; more accurately. The A.V. suggests St Paul’s <span class="ital">helping them</span> on, which is not the point of the Greek word here. See above on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Php 1:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">joy of faith</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">joy of the faith</span>.” R.V. “<span class="ital">joy in the faith</span>.” But <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-13.htm" title="Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that you may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:13</a> (“joy … <span class="ital">in believing</span>”) seems to us to favour the A.V., and Marg. R.V. The definite article quite naturally may mean “<span class="ital">your</span> faith,” your act and experience of believing. For the deep connexion between joy and faith see Rom. quoted above; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-34.htm" title="And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house.">Acts 16:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-8.htm" title="Whom having not seen, you love; in whom, though now you see him not, yet believing, you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory:">1 Peter 1:8</a>.—Both “<span class="ital">progress</span>” and “<span class="ital">joy</span>” in this verse have relation to the word “faith.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-25.htm" title="And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all for your furtherance and joy of faith;">Php 1:25</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ τοῦτο</span>, <span class="ital">and this</span>) While he was writing these things, he had a prophetical suggestion in his mind concerning his continuance among them.—<span class="greekheb">πεποιθὼς οἶδα</span>, <span class="ital">I confidently know</span>) He knew by spiritual <span class="ital">confidence;</span> he did not yet know from the report of men, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-17.htm" title="But the other of love, knowing that I am set for the defense of the gospel.">Php 1:17</a>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-23.htm" title="Him therefore I hope to send presently, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me.">Php 2:23</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μενῶ</span>, <span class="ital">that I shall continue</span>) in life.—<span class="greekheb">συμπαραμενῶ</span>, <span class="ital">remain with</span> you) I shall remain for a considerable length of time with you. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-5.htm" title="They shall fear you as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.">Psalm 72:5</a>, the LXX., <span class="greekheb">συμπαραμενεῖ τῷ ἡλιῳ</span>, <span class="ital">He shall continue along with</span> [<span class="ital">as long as</span>] <span class="ital">the sun</span>. There is no doubt that Paul returned from his first captivity into that country, Philem <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-19.htm" title="But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner.">Hebrews 13:19</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide and continue with you all</span>. Being persuaded of this, that my life is needful for you; or, as others render, "And this I certainly, confidently know." The first translation seems preferable, for St. Paul's assurance does not seem to rest on direct inspiration, but on a calculation of probabilities. The apostles could not always foresee their own future (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-22.htm">Acts 20:22</a>). Bishop Lightfoot says, "The same word <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x3ca;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;</span> is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-25.htm">Acts 20:25</a>, where he expresses his belief that he shall not see his Asiatic converts again. Viewed as infallible presentiments, the two are hardly reconcilable; for the one assumes, the other negatives, his release. The assurance here recorded was fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3</a>); while the presentiment there expressed was overruled by events (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-15.htm">2 Timothy 1:15, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-20.htm">2 Timothy 4:20</a>)." <span class="cmt_word">For your furtherance and joy of faith</span>; for the progress and joy of your faith, that you may continually increase in faith and take delight in it.
