And those who are not really saints on earth, never will be saints in heaven. Out of Christ, the best saints are sinners, and unable to stand before God. There is no peace without grace. Inward peace springs from a sense of Divine favour. And there is no grace and peace but from God our Father, the fountain and origin of all blessings. At Philippi the apostle was evil entreated, and saw little fruit of his labour; yet he remembers Philippi with joy. We must thank our God for the graces and comforts, gifts and usefulness of others, as we receive the benefit, and God receives the glory. The work of grace will never be perfected till the day of Jesus Christ, the day of his appearance. But we may always be confident God will perform his good work, in every soul wherein he has really begun it by regeneration; though we must not trust in outward appearances, nor in any thing but a new creation to holiness. People are dear to their ministers, when they receive benefit by their ministry. Fellow-sufferers in the cause of God should be dear one to another.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grace be unto you ... - See the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-7.htm">Romans 1:7</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Grace &#8230; peace&#8212;The very form of this salutation implies the union of Jew, Greek, and Roman. The Greek salutation was "joy" (chairein), akin to the Greek for "grace" (charis).

Paul feels that the ordinary Greek salutation <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> or the Eastern <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη σοι</span> is too meagre for Christian intercourse. But closely connected with <span class="greekheb">χαίρειν</span> is his own great watchword <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span>, a word which, perhaps, above all others, shows the powerful remoulding of terms by Christian thought and feeling. <span class="greekheb">χάρις</span> for Paul is the central revelation of the fatherly heart of God in the redemption which Christ has accomplished for unworthy sinners. And its direct result is <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη</span>, the harmony and health of that life which is reconciled to God through Jesus Christ; see an interesting discussion of the Apostolic greeting by F. Zimmer, <span class="ital">Luthardt’s Zeitschr.</span>, 1886, p. 443 ff. Of course <span class="greekheb">ἀπό</span> governs <span class="greekheb">Κυρίου</span>.

In its true idea, kindness is always present, with the special thought of <span class="ital">entire and marked absence of obligation</span> in the exercise of it. It is essentially unmerited and free. See e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-6.htm" title="And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.">Romans 11:6</a>. In its normal application, the word denotes the action of Divine kindness either in the judicial acceptance of the believer “not according to his works,” for Christ’s sake (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm" title="Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus:">Romans 3:24</a>), or in the gift and continuance of new life and power to the believer (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-10.htm" title="But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed on me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.">1 Corinthians 15:10</a>). And, as the action is never apart from the Agent, we may say that grace in the first reference is “God for us” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-1.htm" title="There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:1</a>), in the second, “God in us” (below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-13.htm" title="For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.">Php 2:13</a>).—In the first reference grace is the antithesis to <span class="ital">merit</span>, in the second to <span class="ital">nature</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our Father</span>] in the new birth and life, which is coextensive with union with Christ the Son.
