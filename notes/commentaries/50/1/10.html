The word “sincere” (used only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-3.htm" title="According as his divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue:">2Peter 1:3</a>), and the corresponding substantive, “sincerity” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm" title="Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.">1Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm" title="For our rejoicing is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom, but by the grace of God, we have had our conversation in the world, and more abundantly to you-ward.">2Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm" title="For we are not as many, which corrupt the word of God: but as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.">2Corinthians 2:17</a>), although there is some uncertainty as to their derivation, undoubtedly signify purity tested and found clear of all base admixtures. The word “without offence” is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a> (“a conscience void of offence”) for that which is free from the stumbling of error; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm" title="Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:">1Corinthians 10:32</a> (“giving none offence”) for that at which none will stumble. The latter sense (nearly equivalent to the “unreprovable” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm" title=" In the body of his flesh through death, to present you holy and blameless and unreproveable in his sight:">Colossians 1:22</a>) better suits this passage. For “sincere” describes the positive aspect of purity; “without offence” the more negative aspect, in which it is found to present no excuse for fault-finding or scandal. It is, therefore, the “sincerity,” not of unconscious innocence, but of well-tried and thoughtful purity, proof even against suspicion, which St. Paul describes as the perfect fruit of love “overflowing in knowledge.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-11 Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities? Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces. Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That ye may approve things - Margin, "Or, try." The word used here denotes the kind of trial to which metals are exposed in order to test their nature; and the sense here is, that the apostle wished them so to try the things that were of real value, as to discern that which was true and genuine.<p>That are excellent - Margin: Or, "differ." The margin here more correctly expresses the sense of the Greek word. The idea is, that he wished them to be able to distinguish between things that differed from each other; to have an intelligent apprehension of what was right and wrong - of what was good and evil. He would not have them love and approve all things indiscriminately. They should be esteemed according to their real value. It is remarkable here how anxious the apostle was not only that they should be Christians, but that they should be intelligent Christians, and should understand the real worth and value of objects.<p>That ye may be sincere - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-24.htm">Ephesians 6:24</a>. The word used here - &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c2;  eilikrine&#772;s - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-1.htm">2 Peter 3:1</a>, where it is rendered "pure." The noun &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;  eilikrineia, however, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-17.htm">2 Corinthians 2:17</a>; in all which places it is rendered "sincerity." The word properly means, "that which is judged in sunshine" &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  heile&#772; krino&#772;; and then "that which is clear and manifest." It is that over which there are no clouds; which is not doubtful and dark; which is pure and bright. The word "sincere" means literally without wax (sine cera); that is, honey which is pure and transparent. Applied to Christian character, it means that which is not deceitful, ambiguous, hypocritical; that which is not mingled with error, worldliness, and sin; that which does not proceed from selfish and interested motives, and where there is nothing disguised. There is no more desirable appellation that can be given to a man than to say that he is sincere - a sincere friend, benefactor, Christian; and there is nothing more lovely in the character of a Christian than sincerity. It implies:<p>(1) that he is truly converted - that he has not assumed Christianity as a mask;<p>(2) that his motives are disinterested and pure;<p>(3) that his conduct is free from double-dealing, trick, and cunning;<p>(4) that his words express the real sentiments of his heart;<p>(5) that he is true to his word, and faithful to his promises; and,<p>(6) that he is always what he professes to be. A sincere Christian would bear to have the light let in upon him always; to have the emotions of his heart seen; to be scanned everywhere, and at all times, by people, by angels, and by God.<p>And without offence - Inoffensive to others. Not injuring them in property, feelings, or reputation. This is a negative virtue, and is often despised by the world. But it is much to say of a man that he injures no one; that neither by example, nor opinions, nor conversation, he leads them astray; that he never does injustice to their motives, and never impedes their influence; that he never wounds their feelings, or gives occasion for hard thoughts; and that he so lives that all may see that his is a blameless life.<p>Till the day of Christ - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-6.htm">Philippians 1:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

Or "try things that differ". There are some things that differ one from other; as morality and grace, earthly things, and heavenly things, carnal and spiritual, temporal and eternal things, law and Gospel, the doctrines of men, and the doctrines of Christ; all which differ as much as chaff and wheat, as gold, silver, precious stones, and wood, hay, stubble. These are to be tried and proved; they are not to be received without distinction, but should be examined, which is right and best to be chosen and preferred; and to such trial and examination it is necessary that a man should be transformed, by the renewing of his mind, that he should have spiritual light, knowledge, and experience, have his spiritual senses exercised to discern the difference of things, and also the guidance, direction, and influence of the Spirit of God: and this trial must be made, not according to carnal reason, and the judgment and dictates of it; for the most excellent things are above it, and out of its sphere, and therefore judged foolish, and rejected by it; but according to the word of God, the Scriptures of truth, in the light of the divine Spirit, and with spiritual judgment and sense; when some things will be found excellent, as Christ, and the knowledge of him in his person, offices, grace, righteousness, blood, sacrifice, and satisfaction, and the several truths of the Gospel relating to peace, pardon, justification, adoption, sanctification, and eternal life; and of the several doctrines of the Gospel, some will appear in their nature and use more excellent than others, more grand and sublime; such as concern the sovereign and distinguishing grace of God, the glory of Christ, and the salvation of the elect; some being milk for babes, others meat for strong men. And these being tried and proved, first by the word of God, and then by the experience of the saints, are to be approved above thousands of gold and silver, and esteemed more than our necessary food; even the sincere milk of the word, as it is by newborn babes, as well as the strong meat of it by the adult, and all to be highly valued and abode by, and held fast, <p>That ye may be sincere; or "pure", as the Syriac version renders it; pure as the sun, discerned and judged by the light of it, as the word signifies, which discovers motes, faults, and flaws; in which, some think, is a metaphor taken either from the eagle, which holds up its young against the sun, and such as can bear the light of it she retains as her own, but such that cannot she rejects as a spurious brood; or from persons in business, who hold up the goods they are buying to the sun, to see if they can observe any fault in them: so such may be said to be sincere, or pure, who are pure in heart, life, and conversation, whose principles and practices will bear the test of light; such are sincere, who are like honey without wax, and fine flour without leaven, that have no mixture of corruption in doctrine, life, or manners; whose grace is genuine and right; whose faith is unfeigned; whose love to God, and Christ, and one another, is without dissimulation; whose hope is lively, and of a soul purifying nature, and is built on a good foundation; and whose repentance is attended with genuine effects, and proper fruits; whose principles are unmixed; who do not corrupt or adulterate the word of God, but desire and retain the sincere milk of it, and hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience; whose worship is also pure and spiritual, who worship God in spirit and truth, under the influence, and by the assistance of the Spirit of God, and with their whole hearts and spirits, and according to the truth of the Gospel; who keep the ordinances as they were delivered, without any human inventions, corruptions, and mixtures; who are sincere in their hearts, pure and sound in heart, simple, plain hearted, and single eyed; choose to be good, rather than seem to be so; whose desires after God, and divine things, and whose affections for them, are true and real, and proceed from the bottom of their hearts; and who have their conversation in the world by the grace of God, in simplicity and godly sincerity; and such the apostle wishes these saints to be, and adds, <p>and without offence until the day of Christ; to God, as considered in the righteousness of Christ, in which they are perfectly without offence, and will always continue so; or in their walk and conversation before God, in which, though they may in many things offend, yet not be guilty of any notorious iniquity, and much less of living in it: and to themselves, to their own consciences, exercising a conscience void of offence towards God and men; acting according to that light they have received, and those principles they have embraced and professed; desiring to be kept from all evil, that it might not grieve and wound them; and doing nothing in things of an indifferent nature, with offence, or against the dictates of conscience, and to the violation of it: and also to others, to Jew or Gentile, to the world, or to the church of God, by avoiding every thing that is offensive to either; not good things, but evil ones, and those that are indifferent; that peace may be preserved, and their own good may not be evil spoken of; that the children of God may not be grieved, staggered, and stumbled, nor sinners hardened, or have any occasion to blaspheme. The phrase denotes an harmless life and conversation, and a continuance in it to the end, to the day of death, or coming of our Lord, which is to be loved, longed, wished, and looked for, and to be always had in view; and that to engage to a becoming life and conversation, with sincerity, and without offence, since in that day all hearts and actions will be exposed and laid open. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That ye may approve things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and without offence till the day of Christ.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/1.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-10.htm" title="That you may approve things that are excellent; that you may be sincere and without offense till the day of Christ....">Php 1:10-11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] states the <span class="ital">aim</span> of the <span class="greekheb">περισσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐπιγν</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. <span class="greekheb">αἴσθ</span>., and in <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἧτε εἰλικρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. we have the <span class="ital">ultimate design</span>. <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν τὰ διαφέροντα</span> is to be understood, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-18.htm" title="And know his will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law;">Romans 2:18</a> : <span class="ital">in order to approve that which is</span> (morally) <span class="ital">excellent</span>.

Two possible renderings. (1) “Approve things that are excellent.” (2) “Test things that differ,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, good and bad. Lft[4] opposes (2) on the ground that “it requires no keen moral sense to discriminate between good and bad”. But was not this precisely the great difficulty for heathen-Christians? Theophyl. defines <span class="greekheb">τὰ διαφ</span>. by <span class="greekheb">τί δεῖ πρᾶξαι καὶ τί δεῖ μὴ πρᾶξαι</span>. The idea seems to be borne out by the following <span class="greekheb">εἰλικρ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">ἀπρόσκ</span>. We are therefore compelled to decide for (2). “The fundamental choice arrived at in believing has to be reiterated continually in a just application of it to a world of varying and sometimes perplexing cases” (Rainy, <span class="ital">Expos.

Of course this <span class="greekheb">δοκιμάζειν</span> is made possible by the guidance of the indwelling Spirit. It shows us “the highest point which Paul reaches in his treatment of moral questions” (Hitzm., <span class="ital">N.T. Theol.</span>, ii., p. 149, who points out as instances of his delicate moral tact the precepts given in 1 Corinthians 8-10, Romans 14).—<span class="greekheb">εἰλικρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπρόσκ</span>. There is no warrant for adhering to the common derivation of <span class="greekheb">εἰλικρ</span>. from <span class="greekheb">κρίνω</span> compounded with either <span class="greekheb">εἵλη</span> (“heat of sun”) and so = “tested by sunbeam,” or <span class="greekheb">εἵλη</span> (= <span class="greekheb">ἴλη</span> “troops”) and so “separated into ranks”. The word is the equiv. of Lat. <span class="ital">sincerus</span>, “pure,” “unmixed”. A favourite term in Plato for pure intellect and also for the soul purged from sense. <span class="ital">Cf. Phaedo</span>, 66 [5], 67 [6], 81 B. Naturally transferred to the moral sphere. T. H. Green (<span class="ital">Two Sermons</span>, p. 41) describes <span class="greekheb">εἰλικρίνεια</span> as “perfect openness towards God”. <span class="greekheb">ἀπρόσκ</span>. will then mean, in all probability, “not giving offence” to others, the obverse side of <span class="greekheb">εἰλικρ</span>. This sense seems to us to be proved by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm" title="Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:">1 Corinthians 10:32</a> with the context, which is simply an expansion of Paul’s thought here. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-10.htm" title="He that loves his brother stays in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him.">1 John 2:10</a>.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς ἡμέραν Χρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> has the meanings “with a view to” and “until,” which here shade off into each other.

One derivation (favoured by Bp Lightfoot here) is military; from the orderly <span class="ital">separateness</span> of marshalled ranks. Another and commoner one is solar; from the <span class="ital">detection of pollution by sunlight</span>, with the thought of the clearness of what has passed such a test well.—The word “sincere” (from Lat. <span class="ital">sincerus</span>) has a possible connexion with “<span class="ital">sin</span>-gle,” and so with the idea of separation, disengagement, straightness of purpose.

Our common meaning of “offence,” with its special reference to grievances and pique, must be banished from thought in reading the English Bible. There these words are always used to represent original words referring to obstacles, stumbling, and the like. So e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-3.htm" title="Giving no offense in any thing, that the ministry be not blamed:">2 Corinthians 6:3</a>, “giving no <span class="ital">offence</span>” means, presenting no obstacle such as to upset the Christian principle or practice of others.—“<span class="ital">Without offence</span>” here (one word in the Greek) may mean, grammatically, either “<span class="ital">experiencing</span> no such obstacle” or “<span class="ital">presenting</span> none.” The word occurs elsewhere only <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm" title="And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void to offense toward God, and toward men.">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-32.htm" title="Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the church of God:">1 Corinthians 10:32</a>; and the evidence of these passages is exactly divided. On the whole the context here decides for the former alternative. The Apostle is more concerned at present with the inner motives than the outer example of the Philippians: he prays that the simplicity (sincerity) of their spiritual relations with God may be such as never to “upset” the inner workings of will and purpose.—Tyndale and Cranmer render here, “that ye may be pure, and such as (should) hurt no man’s conscience;” Geneva, “that ye may be pure, and go forward without any let.” So Beza’s Latin version.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">till the day of Christ</span>] Lit. <span class="ital">unto</span>, &c.; “against, in view of, the great crisis of eternal award.” <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-16.htm" title="My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feeds among the lilies.">Song of Solomon 2:16</a>, where see note.

According to another possible derivation, the word would mean "unmixed," that is, genuine, sincere. "Without offense" may be taken actively or passively; without giving offense (causing stumbling) to others, or without stumbling themselves. Perhaps the latter sense is more suitable here. He prays that the Philippians may be true and pure inwardly, and blameless in their outward lives. "Till," rather, "against the day of Christ."
