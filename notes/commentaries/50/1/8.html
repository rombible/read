(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-12.htm" title="You are not straitened in us, but you are straitened in your own bowels.">2Corinthians 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/7-15.htm" title="And his inward affection is more abundant toward you, whilst he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.">2Corinthians 7:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-12.htm" title=" Put on therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering;">Colossians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-7.htm" title="For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the bowels of the saints are refreshed by you, brother.">Philemon 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-12.htm" title="Whom I have sent again: you therefore receive him, that is, my own bowels:">Philemon 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-20.htm" title="Yes, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord: refresh my bowels in the Lord.">Philemon 1:20</a>.) It corresponds to our use of “heart” as the seat of affection—the word “heart” itself in the New Testament being employed, in a wider sense, to signify the whole inner man. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-18.htm" title="The eyes of your understanding being enlightened; that you may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,">Ephesians 1:18</a> : “the eyes of your heart being enlightened,” and Note there.) But the phrase here is striking and even startling. “I long after you” (says St. Paul) “in the heart of Jesus Christ.” He can say (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>), “I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.” Hence the deep yearning of love which he feels for them he knows to be an emanation, faint indeed, but true, from the “heart of Jesus Christ” dwelling in him.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:8-11 Shall not we pity and love those souls whom Christ loves and pities? Those who abound in any grace, need to abound more. Try things which differ; that we may approve the things which are excellent. The truths and laws of Christ are excellent; and they recommend themselves as such to any attentive mind. Sincerity is that in which we should have our conversation in the world, and it is the glory of all our graces. Christians should not be apt to take offence, and should be very careful not to offend God or the brethren. The things which most honour God will most benefit us. Let us not leave it doubtful whether any good fruit is found in us or not. A small measure of Christian love, knowledge, and fruitfulness should not satisfy any.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For God is my record - My witness; I can solemnly appeal to him.<p>How greatly I long after you all - To see you; and how much I desire your welfare.<p>In the bowels of Jesus Christ - The word "bowels," in the Scriptures denotes the upper viscera - the region of the heart and lungs: see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-11.htm">Isaiah 16:11</a>. That region was regarded as the seat of affection, sympathy, and compassion, as the heart is with us. The allusion here is to the sympathy, tenderness, and love of the Redeemer; and probably the meaning is, that Paul regarded them with something of the affection which the Lord Jesus had for them. This was the tenderest and strongest expression which he could find to denote the ardor of his attachment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

The Greek word in the classics means, strictly, the “nobler vitals,” including the heart, as distinguished from the intestines (Æschylus, <span class="ital">Agam.</span>, 1221). On the other hand the Septuagint in their (rare) use of the word do not observe such a distinction, and render by it the Heb. <span class="ital">rachamîm</span>, the bowels, regarded as the seat of tender feeling. But in any case, the question is not of anatomy, but of current usage and reference; and our word <span class="ital">“heart”</span> is thus the best rendering.—The phrase here carries with it no assertion of a physicospiritual theory; it only uses, as a modern naturalist might equally well do, a physical term as a symbol for non-physical emotion.—R.V. paraphrases “<span class="ital">tender mercies</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The phraseology (“<span class="ital">in</span> the heart <span class="ital">of Christ Jesus</span>”) is deeply significant. The Christian’s personality is never lost, but he is so united to his Lord, “one Spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-17.htm" title="But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.">1 Corinthians 6:17</a>), that the emotions of the regenerate member are, as it were, in continuity with those of the ever-blessed Head. Tyndale (1534), Cranmer (1539), and Geneva (1557) render “from the very heart root in Jesus Christ.”—The ministration of His life to the member is such that there is more than sympathy in the matter; there is communication.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν σπλάγχνοις Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span>) Not Paul, but Jesus Christ lives in Paul; wherefore Paul is not moved in the bowels of Paul, but of Jesus Christ.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For God is my record</span> - rather, <span class="accented">witness</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm">Romans 1:9</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ</span>.

The expression is remarkable, and is well illustrated by Bengel's striking words, "Paulus non in Pauli, sed Jesu Christi movetur visceribus." "Not I, but Christ liveth in me."
