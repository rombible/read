(comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm" title="I Tertius, who wrote this letter, salute you in the Lord.">Romans 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm" title="The churches of Asia salute you.

This is the connection adopted by Ambrosiaster, Estius, Heinrichs, Rilliet, Wiesinger, Schenkel, and J. B. Lightfoot, and it is the right one, since with <span class="greekheb">ἅγιον</span> it is self-evident that <span class="ital">Christians</span> are meant, and there would be no motive for specially expressing this here, as there was, for instance, in the address <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a>, where <span class="greekheb">τοῖς ἁγίοις ἐν Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. bears a certain <span class="ital">formal</span> character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ ἀδελφ</span>.] is the narrower circle of those Christians who were round the apostle in Rome, including also the <span class="ital">official colleagues</span> who were with him, though there is no ground for understanding these <span class="ital">alone</span> (Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, and many others), Grotius even pointing distinctly to <span class="ital">Timothy, Linus</span>, and <span class="ital">Clement</span>. The difficulty, which has been raised in this case by a comparison of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a>, is unfounded, since, in fact, the expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a> excludes neither the giving of a salutation nor the mention of brethren; groundless, therefore, are the attempted solutions of the difficulty, as, for example, that of Chrysostom, that either <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a> is meant <span class="greekheb">οὐ περὶ τῶν ἐν τῇ πόλει</span>, or that Paul <span class="greekheb">οὐ παραιτεῖται καὶ τούτους ἀδελφοὺς καλεῖν</span> (comp. Oecumenius, who brings forward the latter as a proof of the <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα</span> of the apostle). Misapprehending this second and in itself correct remark of Chrysostom, van Hengel insists on a distinction being drawn between two classes of companions in office, namely, <span class="ital">travelling companions</span>, such as Luke, Mark, Titus, Silas, and those <span class="ital">who were resident in the places where</span> the apostle <span class="ital">sojourned</span> (among whom van Hengel reckons in Rome, Clement, Euodia, Syntyche, and even Epaphroditus), and holds that only the latter class is here meant. The limits of the narrower circle designated by <span class="greekheb">οἱ σὺν ἐμοὶ ἀδ</span>. are not at all to be definitely drawn. Estius well says: “Qui … mihi vincto ministrant, qui me visitant, qui mecum hic in evangelio laborant.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάντες οἱ ἅγιοι</span>] generally, <span class="ital">all Christians</span> who are here; comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="Greet one another with an holy kiss.">2 Corinthians 13:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-20.htm" title="All the brothers greet you.

Comp. Plat. <span class="ital">Critias</span>, p. 108 D: <span class="greekheb">τούς τε ἄλλους κλητέον καὶ δὴ καὶ τὰ μάλιστα Μνημοσύνην</span>. Whether these persons stood in any personal relations to the Philippians, remains uncertain. It is enough to assume that Paul had said to them much that was honourable concerning the church to which he was about to write.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐκ τῆς Καίσαρος οἰκίας</span>] <span class="ital">sc</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἅγιοι</span> as is plain from the connection with the preceding (in opposition to Hofmann): <span class="ital">those from the emperor’s house</span> (from the <span class="ital">Palatium</span>, see Böttger, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. II. p. 49) who belong to the saints. We have to think of probably inferior <span class="ital">servants</span> of the emperor (according to Grotius, Hitzig, and others: <span class="ital">freedmen</span>), who <span class="ital">dwelt</span>, or at least <span class="ital">were employed, in the palace</span>. In this way there is no need for departing from the immediate meaning of the word, and taking it in the sense of <span class="ital">household</span> (Hofmann). In no case, however, can we adopt as the direct meaning of <span class="greekheb">οἰκία</span> the sense of <span class="ital">domestic servants</span>, a meaning which it does not bear even in Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. ii. 7. 6; Joseph. <span class="ital">Antt</span>. xvi. 5. 8; and Tac. <span class="ital">Hist</span>. ii. 92;[197] <span class="ital">domestic servants</span> would be <span class="greekheb">οἰκετεία</span>. Others have taken <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟἸΚΊΑ</span></span></span>, in accordance with current usage, as <span class="ital">family</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-15.htm" title="I beseech you, brothers, (you know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first fruits of Achaia, and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints,)">1 Corinthians 16:15</a>, and frequently), and have understood <span class="ital">kinsmen of the emperor</span>, a meaning which in itself seems by no means shown by Philo <span class="ital">in Flacc</span>. p. 190 A to be at variance with linguistic usage[198] (in opposition to Hofmann). So recently Baur, who needed this point for his combinations against the genuineness of the epistle, and van Hengel.[199] But apart from the fact that through Nero himself this family was greatly diminished, and that conversions among those related to the emperor were <span class="ital">à priori</span> (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-26.htm" title="For you see your calling, brothers, how that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:">1 Corinthians 1:26</a> ff.) very improbable, doubtless some historical traces of such a striking success would have been preserved in tradition.[200] Matthies, quite arbitrarily, understands the <span class="ital">Praetorians</span>, as if Paid had written: <span class="greekheb">οἱ ἐκ τοῦ πραιτωρίου</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Php 1:13</a>). This also applies, in opposition to Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. d. apostol. Zeitalt</span>. p. 420, who, considering the Praetorium to be a portion of the palace (see remark on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-13.htm" title="So that my bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace, and in all other places;">Php 1:13</a>), thinks the apostle alludes <span class="ital">especially</span> to the Praetorians. Those who transfer the epistle to Caesarea (see Introduction, § 2), suppose the <span class="ital">Praetorium of Herod in that place</span> to be intended, and consequently also think of <span class="ital">Praetorians</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-35.htm" title="I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's judgment hall.">Acts 23:35</a> (Paulus, Böttger); or (so Rilliet) taking <span class="greekheb">οἰκία</span> as <span class="ital">familia</span>, of administrators of the imperial private domain, called <span class="ital">Caesariani</span> or <span class="ital">Procurators</span>—a view against which the plural should have warned them; or even of “the family of the imperial freedman <span class="ital">Felix</span>” (Thiersch). What <span class="ital">persons</span>, moreover, were meant (various of the older expositors have even included <span class="ital">Seneca</span>[201] among them), is a point just as unknown to us, as it was well known to the Philippians or became known to them through Epaphroditus. The general result is, that people from the imperial palace were Christians, and that those could obtain access to the apostle probably with special ease and frequency; hence their <span class="ital">especial</span> salutation. The question also, whether one or another of the persons saluted in Romans 16 should be understood as included here (see especially J. B. Lightfoot, p. 173 ff.), must remain entirely undecided. Calvin, moreover, well points to the working of the divine mercy, in that the gospel “in illam scelerum omnium et flagitiorum abyssum penetraverit.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ χάρις τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κυρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>.] see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-6.htm" title="I marvel that you are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel:">Galatians 1:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΕΤᾺ ΠΆΝΤΩΝ ὙΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>] Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-24.htm" title="The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.

Herodian, iii. 10. 9: <span class="greekheb">πρὶν εἰς τὸν βασίλειον οἶκον παριλθεῖν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[198] For in Philo <span class="ital">l.c.</span> it is said regarding Herod Agrippa: “Even though he were not king, but only one of the emperor’s kinsmen (<span class="greekheb">ἑκ τῆς Καίσαρος οἰκίας</span>), it would still be necessary to prefer and honour him.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[199] Whether Chrysostom and his successors understood here <span class="ital">members of the imperial family,</span> is a matter of doubt. At all events Chrysostom does not take the word itself, <span class="greekheb">οἰκία</span> as <span class="ital">family,</span> but explains it by <span class="greekheb">τὰ βασίλεια</span>, <span class="ital">palace,</span> and finds in the salutation a purpose <span class="ital">of encouragement:</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰ γὰρ οἱ ἐν τοῖς βασιλείοις πάντων κατιφρόνησαν διὰ τὸν βασιλία τῶν οὐρανῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">πολλῷ μᾶλλον αὐτοὺς χρὴ τοῦτο ποιεῖν</span> Comp. Theodoret, Oecumenius, Theophylact.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[200] Certainly Baur believes that he has found these traces in sufficient number. <span class="ital">Flavius Clemens,</span> namely, was a kinsman of Domitian (see on ver. 3). Now, since out of <span class="ital">this</span> Clement grew the Clemens <span class="ital">Romanus</span> of Christian tradition, the latter also must have been a kinsman of the imperial family, as indeed the <span class="ital">Homil. Clement,</span> iv. 7, comp. xiv. 10, designate him as <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ πρὸς γένους Τιβεριου Καίσαρος</span> He, therefore, would be exactly the man, in whom Christianity was represented in the circle of the imperial house itself. <span class="ital">“Concluding from one that there were several, the author of the epistle might make his apostle write earnest salutations to the church in Philippi from beliveing members of the imperial house in the plural,”</span> etc. Thus does criticism, departing from the solid ground of history, lose itself in the atmosphere of subjective inventions, where hypothesis finds no longer either support or limit. Indeed, Baur now goes further beyond all bounds (II. p. 69), and discovers that the mention of Clement even throws <span class="ital">a new light over the whole plan of the epistle.</span> With this Clement, namely, and the participation, as attested by him, of the imperial house in the gospel, is given the <span class="greekheb">προκοπὴ τοῦ εἰαγγ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-12.htm" title="But I would you should understand, brothers, that the things which happened to me have fallen out rather to the furtherance of the gospel;">Php 1:12</a>), and with the latter the feeling of <span class="ital">joyfulness,</span> which expresses itself throughout the epistle as the ground-tone of the apostle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a> f., comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.

Only by the preponderance of this feeling is it to be explained that the author makes his apostle even express the hope of a speedy liberation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-24.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord that I also myself shall come shortly.">Php 2:24</a>). But with this joy there is also blended, with a neutralizing effect, the idea of a nearly approaching death, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-20.htm" title="According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death....">Php 1:20-24</a>, and this divided state of mind between life and death betrays an author <span class="ital">“who had already before his eyes as an actual fact the end of the apostle, which was so far from harmonizing with all these presuppositions.”</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[201] See generally on <span class="ital">“Paul and Seneca,”</span> and the apocryphal fourteen Latin letters exchanged between them, Baur in Hilgenfeld’s <span class="ital">Zeitschr.</span> 1858, 2. 3; Reuss in Herzog’s <span class="ital">Encyklop.</span> XIV. p. 274 ff.; J.

Every saint individually - an expression of personal affection. The words,  "in Christ Jesus," may be taken with "salute," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-22.htm">Romans 16:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-19.htm">1 Corinthians 16:19</a>. It is a Christian salutation, an acknowledgment of spiritual relationship; or better, perhaps, as in numerous passages, with "saint." All saints are in Christ, members of his body, knit together into one communion and fellowship in the mystical body of Christ. It is this union with Christ which makes them saints. <span class="cmt_word">The brethren which are with me greet you.</span> Observe, he calls them "brethren," though he had none like-minded with him, save only Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm">Philippians 2:20, 21</a>). </body></html>
