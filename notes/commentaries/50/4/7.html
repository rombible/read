It is peace—the sense of unity in the largest sense—the “peace on earth” proclaimed at our Lord’s birth, left as His last legacy to His disciples, and pronounced at His first coming back to them from the grave (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-14.htm" title="Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.">Luke 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm" title="Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you: not as the world gives, give I to you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.">John 14:27</a>). Hence it includes peace with God, peace with men, peace with self. It keeps—that is, watches over with the watchfulness that “neither slumbers nor sleeps”—both “the hearts and minds” (or, more properly, <span class= "ital">the souls and the thoughts formed</span> <span class= "ital">in them</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>guarding our whole spiritual action, both in its source and its developments. It is “through Christ Jesus,” for “He is our peace (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm" title="For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of partition between us;">Ephesians 2:14</a>), as “making all one,” and “reconciling all to God.” The comprehensiveness and beauty of the passage has naturally made it (with the characteristic change from the “shall” of promise to the “may” of benediction) the closing blessing of our most solemn church service of “Holy Communion” with God and man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE WARRIOR PEACE</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-7.htm" title="And the peace of God, which passes all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.">Php 4:7</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The great Mosque of Constantinople was once a Christian church, dedicated to the Holy Wisdom. Over its western portal may still be read, graven on a brazen plate, the words, ‘Come unto Me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you rest.’ For four hundred years noisy crowds have fought, and sorrowed, and fretted, beneath the dim inscription in an unknown tongue; and no eye has looked at it, nor any heart responded. It is but too sad a symbol of the reception which Christ’s offers meet amongst men, and--blessed be His name!--its prominence there, though unread and unbelieved, is a symbol of the patient forbearance with which rejected blessings are once and again pressed upon us, and He stretches out His hand though no man regards, and calls though none do hear. My text is Christ’s offer of peace. The world offers excitement, Christ promises repose.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Mark, then, first, this peace of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What is it? What are its elements? Whence does it come? It is of God, as being its Source, or Origin, or Author, or Giver, but it belongs to Him in a yet deeper sense, for Himself is Peace. And in some humble but yet real fashion our restless and anxious hearts may partake in the divine tranquillity, and with a calm repose, kindred with that rest from which it is derived, may enter into His rest.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If that be too high a flight, at all events the peace that may be ours was Christ’s, in the perfect and unbroken tranquillity of His perfect Manhood. What, then, are its elements? The peace of God must, first of all, be peace with God. Conscious friendship with Him is indispensable to all true tranquillity. Where that is absent there may be the ignoring of the disturbed relationship; but there will be no peace of heart. The indispensable requisite is ‘a conscience like a sea at rest.’ Unless we have made sure work of our relationship with God, and know that He and we are friends, there is no real repose possible for us. In the whirl of excitement we may forget, and for a time turn away from, the realities of our relation to Him, and so get such gladness as is possible to a life not rooted in conscious friendship with Him. But such lives will be like some of those sunny islands in the Eastern Pacific, extinct volcanoes, where nature smiles and all things are prodigal and life is easy and luxuriant; but some day the clouds gather, and the earth shakes, and fire pours forth, and the sea boils, and every living thing dies, and darkness and desolation come. You are living, brother, upon a volcano’s side, unless the roots of your being are fixed in a God who is your friend.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, the peace of God is peace within ourselves. The unrest of human life comes largely from our being torn asunder by contending impulses. Conscience pulls this way, passion that. Desire says, ‘Do this’; reason, judgment, prudence say, ‘It is at your peril if you do!’ One desire fights against another, and so the man is rent asunder. There must be the harmonising of all the Being if there is to be real rest of spirit. No longer must it be like the chaos ere the creative word was spoken, where, in gloom, contending elements strove.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, men have not peace, because in most of them everything is topmost that ought to be undermost, and everything undermost that ought to be uppermost. ‘Beggars are on horseback’ {and we know where they ride}, ‘and princes walking.’ The more regal part of the man’s nature is suppressed, and trodden under foot; and the servile parts, which ought to be under firm restraint, and guided by a wise hand, are too often supreme, and wild work comes of that. When you put the captain and the officers, and everybody on board that knows anything about navigation, into irons, and fasten down the hatches on them, and let the crew and the cabin boys take the helm and direct the ship, it is not likely that the voyage will end anywhere but on the rocks. Multitudes are living lives of unrestfulness, simply because they have set the lowest parts of their nature upon the throne, and subordinated the highest to these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Our unrest comes from yet another source. We have not peace, because we have not found and grasped the true objects for any of our faculties. God is the only possession that brings quiet. The heart hungers until it feeds upon Him. The mind is satisfied with no truth until behind truth it finds a Person who is true. The will is enslaved and wretched until in God it recognises legitimate and absolute authority, which it is blessing to obey. Love puts out its yearnings, like the filaments that gossamer spiders send out into the air, seeking in vain for something to fasten upon, until it touches God, and clings there. There is no rest for a man until he rests in God. The reason why this world is so full of excitement is because it is so empty of peace, and the reason why it is so empty of peace is because it is so void of God. The peace of God brings peace with Him, and peace within. It unites our hearts to fear His name, and draws all the else turbulent and confusedly flowing impulses of the great deep of the spirit after itself, in a tidal wave, as the moon draws the waters of the gathered ocean. The peace of God is peace with Him, and peace within.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I need not, I suppose, do more than say one word about that descriptive clause in my text, It ‘passeth understanding.’ The understanding is not the faculty by which men lay hold of the peace of God any more than you can see a picture with your ears or hear music with your eyes. To everything its own organ; you cannot weigh truth in a tradesman’s scales or measure thought with a yard-stick. Love is not the instrument for apprehending Euclid, nor the brain the instrument for grasping these divine and spiritual gifts. The peace of God transcends the understanding, as well as belongs to another order of things than that about which the understanding is concerned. You must experience it to know it; you must have it in order that you may feel its sweetness. It eludes the grasp of the wisest, though it yields itself to the patient and loving heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. So notice, in the next place, what the peace of God does.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It ‘shall keep your hearts and minds.’ The Apostle here blends together, in a very remarkable manner, the conceptions of peace and of war, for he employs a purely military word to express the office of this Divine peace. That word, ‘shall keep,’ is the same as is translated in another of his letters kept with a garrison --and, though, perhaps, it might be going too far to insist that the military idea is prominent in his mind, it will certainly not be unsafe to recognise its presence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, then, this Divine peace takes upon itself warlike functions, and garrisons the heart and mind. What does he mean by ‘the heart and mind’? Not, as the English reader might suppose, two different faculties, the emotional and the intellectual--which is what we usually roughly mean by our distinction between heart and mind--but, as is always the case in the Bible, the ‘heart’ means the whole inner man, whether considered as thinking, willing, purposing, or doing any other inward act; and the word rendered ‘mind’ does not mean another part of human nature, but the whole products of the operations of the heart. The Revised Version renders it by ‘thoughts,’ and that is correct if it be given a wide enough application, so as to include emotions, affections, purposes, as well as ‘thoughts’ in the narrower sense. The whole inner man, in all the extent of its manifold operations, that indwelling peace of God will garrison and guard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So note, however profound and real that Divine peace is, it is to be enjoyed in the midst of warfare. Quiet is not quiescence. God’s peace is not torpor. The man that has it has still to wage continual conflict, and day by day to brace himself anew for the fight. The highest energy of action is the result of the deepest calm of heart; just as the motion of this solid, and, as we feel it to be, immovable world, is far more rapid through the abysses of space, and on its own axis, than any of the motions of the things on its surface. So the quiet heart, ‘which moveth altogether if it move at all,’ rests whilst it moves, and moves the more swiftly because of its unbroken repose. That peace of God, which is peace militant, is unbroken amidst all conflicts. The wise old Greeks chose for the protectress of Athens the goddess of Wisdom, and whilst they consecrated to her the olive branch, which is the symbol of peace, they set her image on the Parthenon, helmed and spear-bearing, to defend the peace, which she brought to earth. So this heavenly Virgin, whom the Apostle personifies here, is the ‘winged sentry, all skilful in the wars,’ who enters into our hearts and fights for us to keep us in unbroken peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible day by day to go out to toil and care and anxiety and change and suffering and conflict, and yet to bear within our hearts the unalterable rest of God. Deep in the bosom of the ocean, beneath the region where winds howl and billows break, there is calm, but the calm is not stagnation. Each drop from these fathomless abysses may be raised to the surface by the power of the sunbeams, expanded there by their heat, and sent on some beneficent message across the world. So, deep in our hearts, beneath the storm, beneath the raving winds and the curling waves, there may be a central repose, as unlike stagnation as it is unlike tumult; and the peace of God may, as a warrior, keep our hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What is the plain English of that metaphor? Just this, that a man who has that peace as his conscious possession is lifted above the temptations that otherwise would drag him away. The full cup, filled with precious wine, has no room in it for the poison that otherwise might be poured in. As Jesus Christ has taught us, there is such a thing as cleansing a heart in some measure, and yet because it is ‘empty,’ though it is ‘swept and garnished,’ the demons come back again. The best way to be made strong to resist temptation, is to be lifted above feeling it to be a temptation, by reason of the sweetness of the peace possessed. Oh! if our hearts were filled, as they might be filled, with that divine repose, do you think that the vulgar, coarse-tasting baits which make our mouths water now would have any power over us? Will a man who bears in his hands jewels of priceless value, and knows them to be such, find much temptation when some imitation stone, made of coloured glass and a tinfoil backing, is presented to him? Will the world draw us away if we are rooted and grounded in the peace of God? Geologists tell us that climates are changed and creatures are killed by the slow variation of level in the earth. If you and I can only heave our lives up high enough, the foul things that live down below will find the air too pure and keen for them, and will die and disappear; and all the vermin that stung and nestled down in the flats will be gone when we get up to the heights. The peace of God will keep our hearts and thoughts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Now, lastly, notice how we get the peace of God.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>My text is an exuberant promise, but it is knit on to something before, by that ‘and’ at the beginning of the verse. It is a promise, as all God’s promises are, on conditions. And here are the conditions. ‘Be careful for nothing; but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known unto God.’ That defines the conditions in part; and the last words of the text itself complete the definition. ‘In Christ Jesus’ describes, not so much where we are to be kept, as a condition under which we shall be kept. How, then, can I get this peace into my turbulent, changeful life?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I answer, first, trust is peace. It is always so; even when it is misplaced we are at rest. The condition of repose for the human heart is that we shall be ‘in Christ,’ who has said, ‘In the world ye shall have tribulation, but in Me ye shall have peace.’ And how may I be ‘in Him’? Simply by trusting myself to Him. That brings peace with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The sinless Son of God has died on the Cross, a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world, for yours and for mine. Let us trust to that, and we shall have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. And ‘in Him’ we have, by trust, inward peace, for He, through our faith, controls our whole natures, and Faith leads the lion in a silken leash, like Spenser’s Una. Trust in Christ brings peace amid outward sorrows and conflicts. When the pilot comes on board the captain does not leave the bridge, but stands by the pilot’s side. His responsibility is past, but his duties are not over. And when Christ comes into my heart, my effort, my judgment, are not made unnecessary, or put on one side. Let Him take the command, and stand beside Him, and carry out His orders, and you will find rest to your souls.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, submission is peace. What makes our troubles is not outward circumstances, howsoever afflictive they may be, but the resistance of our spirits to the circumstances. And where a man’s will bends and says, ‘Not mine but Thine be done,’ there is calm. Submission is like the lotion that is applied to mosquito bites--it takes away the irritation, though the puncture be left. Submission is peace, both as resignation and as obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Communion is peace. You will get no quiet until you live with God. Until He is at your side you will always be moved.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So, dear friend, fix this in your minds: a life without Christ is a life without peace. Without Him you may have excitement, pleasure, gratified passions, success, accomplished hopes, but peace never! You never have had it, have you? If you live without Him, you may forget that you have not Him, and you can plunge into the world, and so lose the consciousness of the aching void, but it is there all the same. You never will have peace until you go to Him. There is only one way to get it. The Christless heart is like the troubled sea that cannot rest. There is no peace for it. But in Him you can get it for the asking. ‘The chastisement of our peace was laid upon Him.’ For our sakes He died on the Cross, so making peace. Trust Him as your only hope, Saviour and friend, and the God of peace will ‘fill you with all joy and peace in believing.’ Then bow your wills to Him in acceptance of His providence, and in obedience to His commands, and so, ‘your peace shall be as a river, and your righteousness as the waves of the sea.’ Then keep your hearts in union and communion with Him, and so His presence will keep you in perfect peace whilst conflicts last, and, with Him at your side, you will pass through the valley of the shadow of death undisturbed, and come to the true Salem, the city of peace, where they beat their swords into ploughshares, and learn and fear war no more.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:2-9 Let believers be of one mind, and ready to help each other. As the apostle had found the benefit of their assistance, he knew how comfortable it would be to his fellow-labourers to have the help of others. Let us seek to give assurance that our names are written in the book of life. Joy in God is of great consequence in the Christian life; and Christians need to be again and again called to it. It more than outweighs all causes for sorrow. Let their enemies perceive how moderate they were as to outward things, and how composedly they suffered loss and hardships. The day of judgment will soon arrive, with full redemption to believers, and destruction to ungodly men. There is a care of diligence which is our duty, and agrees with a wise forecast and due concern; but there is a care of fear and distrust, which is sin and folly, and only perplexes and distracts the mind. As a remedy against perplexing care, constant prayer is recommended. Not only stated times for prayer, but in every thing by prayer. We must join thanksgivings with prayers and supplications; not only seek supplies of good, but own the mercies we have received. God needs not to be told our wants or desires; he knows them better than we do; but he will have us show that we value the mercy, and feel our dependence on him. The peace of God, the comfortable sense of being reconciled to God, and having a part in his favour, and the hope of the heavenly blessedness, are a greater good than can be fully expressed. This peace will keep our hearts and minds through Christ Jesus; it will keep us from sinning under troubles, and from sinking under them; keep us calm and with inward satisfaction. Believers are to get and to keep a good name; a name for good things with God and good men. We should walk in all the ways of virtue, and abide therein; then, whether our praise is of men or not, it will be of God. The apostle is for an example. His doctrine and life agreed together. The way to have the God of peace with us, is to keep close to our duty. All our privileges and salvation arise in the free mercy of God; yet the enjoyment of them depends on our sincere and holy conduct. These are works of God, pertaining to God, and to him only are they to be ascribed, and to no other, neither men, words, nor deeds.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the peace of God - The peace which God gives. The peace here particularly referred to is that which is felt when we have no anxious care about the supply of our needs, and when we go confidently and commit everything into the hands of God. "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3</a>; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-27.htm">John 14:27</a>.<p>Which passeth all understanding - That is, which surpasses all that people had conceived or imagined. The expression is one that denotes that the peace imparted is of the highest possible kind. The apostle Paul frequently used terms which had somewhat of a hyperbolical cast (see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/21-25.htm">John 21:25</a>, and the language here is that which one would use who designed to speak of that which was of the highest order. The Christian, committing his way to God, and feeling that he will order all things aright, has a peace which is nowhere else known. Nothing else will furnish it but religion. No confidence that a man can have in his own powers; no reliance which he can repose on his own plans or on the promises or fidelity of his fellow-men, and no calculations which he can make on the course of events, can impart such peace to the soul as simple confidence in God.<p>Shall keep your hearts and minds - That is, shall keep them from anxiety and agitation. The idea is, that by thus making our requests known to God, and going to him in view of all our trials and wants, the mind would be preserved from distressing anxiety. The way to find peace, and to have the heart kept from trouble, is thus to go and spread out all before the Lord; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-3.htm">Isaiah 26:3-4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-20.htm">Isaiah 26:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-1.htm">Isaiah 37:1-7</a>. The word rendered here "shall keep," is a military term, and means that the mind would be guarded as a camp or castle is. It would be preserved from the intrusion of anxious fears and alarms.<p>Through Christ Jesus - By his agency, or intervention. It is only in him that the mind can be preserved in peace. It is not by mere confidence in God, or by mere prayer, but it is by confidence in God as he is revealed through the Redeemer, and by faith in him. Paul never lost sight of the truth that all the security and happiness of a believer were to be traced to the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7.

It is therefore not to be understood, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-1.htm" title="Therefore being justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ:">Romans 5:1</a>, as “pax, <span class="ital">qua reconciliati estis Deo</span>” (Erasmus, <span class="ital">Paraphr.;</span> so Chrysostom, <span class="greekheb">ἡ καταλλαγὴ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγάπη τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>; and Theophylact, Oecumenius, Beza, Estius, Wetstein, and others, including Storr, Matthies, and van Hengel), which would be too general and foreign to the context. The peace of reconciliation is the <span class="ital">presupposition</span> of the divinely produced moral feeling which is here meant; the former is <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη πρὸς τὸν Θεόν</span>, the latter <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ ὑπερέχουσα πάντα νοῦν</span>] <span class="ital">which surpasses every reason</span>, namely, in regard to its salutary power and efficacy; that is, <span class="ital">which</span> is able <span class="ital">more than any reason to elevate above all solicitude</span>, to comfort and to strengthen. Because the reason in its moral thinking, willing, and feeling is of itself too weak to confront the power of the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-25.htm" title="I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord.

This can be effected by nothing but the agency of the divine peace, which is given by means of the Spirit in the believing heart, when by its prayer and supplication with thanksgiving it has elevated itself to God and has confided to Him all its concerns, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-7.htm" title="Casting all your care on him; for he cares for you.">1 Peter 5:7</a>. Then, in virtue of this blessed peace, the heart <span class="ital">experiences</span> what it could not have experienced by means of its own thinking, feeling, and willing. According to de Wette, the <span class="ital">doubting</span> and heart-disquieting <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span> is meant, which is surpassed by the peace of God, because the latter is based upon faith and feeling. In opposition to this, however, stands the <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>, according to which not merely all <span class="ital">doubting</span> reason, but <span class="ital">every</span> reason is meant. <span class="ital">No one</span>, not even the believer and regenerate, has through his reason and its action what he has through the peace of God. Others have explained it in the sense of the <span class="ital">incomprehensibleness</span> of the peace of God, “the greatness of which the understanding cannot even grasp” (Wiesinger). So Chrysostom, Oecumenius, Theophylact, Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Grotius, also Hoelemann and Weiss.

This protecting vigilance is more precisely defined by <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>., which expresses its specific character, so far as this peace of God is <span class="ital">in Christ</span> as the element of its nature and life, and therefore its influence, protecting and keeping men’s hearts, is not otherwise realized and carried out than in this its holy sphere of life, which is Christ. The <span class="greekheb">φρουρά</span> which the peace of God exercises implies in Christ, as it were, the <span class="greekheb">φρουραρχία</span> (Xen. <span class="ital">Mem</span>. iv. 4. 17). Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-15.htm" title=" And let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to the which also you are called in one body; and be you thankful.">Colossians 3:15</a>, where the <span class="greekheb">εἰρήνη τοῦ Χριστοῦ βραβεύει</span> in men’s hearts.

Chrysostom, Theophylact, Luther, Zanchius, and others, including Heinrichs, Storr, Flatt, Rheinwald, van Hengel, Matthies, Rilliet, Wiesinger, Weiss. But the words do not affirm <span class="ital">wherein</span> watchful activity is to <span class="ital">keep</span> or <span class="ital">preserve</span> the readers (Paul does not write <span class="greekheb">τηρήσει</span>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-11.htm" title="And now I am no more in the world, but these are in the world, and I come to you.

The artificial suggestion of Hoelemann (“Christo fere cinguli instar <span class="greekheb">τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. circumcludente,” etc.) is all the less warranted, the more familiar the idea <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span> was to the apostle as representing the element in which the life and action, as Christian, move.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">pernicious influences themselves</span>, the withholding and warding off of which are meant by <span class="greekheb">φρουρήσει κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., are not to be arbitrarily limited, <span class="ital">e.g</span>. to <span class="ital">opponents</span> (Heinrichs), or to <span class="ital">Satan</span> (Beza, Grotius, and others), or <span class="ital">sin</span> (Theophylact), or <span class="ital">pravas cogitationes</span> (Calvin), or “<span class="ital">omnes insultus et curas</span>” (Bengel), and the like; but to be left quite general, comprehending all such special aspects. Erasmus well says (<span class="ital">Paraphr</span>.): “adversus omnia, quae hic possunt incidere formidanda.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὰς καρδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰ νοήμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>] emphatically kept apart. It is enough to add Bengel’s note: “cor sedes cogitationum.” Comp. Roos, <span class="ital">Fundam. psychol. ex sacr. script</span>. III. § 6: “causa cogitationum interna eaque libera.” The heart is the organ of self-consciousness, and therefore the moral seat of the activity of thought and will.

Whether there be a stop or not, this verse is manifestly a kind of apodosis to the preceding. “If you make your requests, etc., … then the peace … shall guard,” etc. <span class="greekheb">ἡ εἰρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. Paul’s favourite thought of that health and harmonious relation which prevail in the inner life as the result of reconciliation with God through Jesus Christ. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-28.htm" title="Come to me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.">Matthew 11:28</a>. It would be an undue restriction of his thought to imagine that he only refers to agreement between members of the Church, although, no doubt, that idea is here included. “This peace is like some magic mirror, by the dimness growing on which we may discern the breath of an unclean spirit that would work us ill” (Rendel Harris, <span class="ital">Memoranda Sacra</span>, p. 130; the quotation skilfully catches the spiritual conception before Paul’s mind). To share anxiety with God is to destroy its corroding power and to be calmed by His peace. Peace is used as a name of God in the Talmud (see Taylor, <span class="ital">Jewish Fathers</span>, pp. 25–26).—<span class="greekheb">ἡ ὑπερέχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα νοῦν</span>. “Which surpasses every thought, all our conception.” (So also Chr[31]., Erasm., Weizs., Moule, Von Soden, etc.). This meaning seems inevitable from the parallel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm" title="Now to him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power that works in us,">Ephesians 3:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">τῷ δὲ δυναμένῳ ὑπὲρ πάντα ποιῆσαι ὑπερεκπερισσοῦ ὧν αἰτούμεθα ἢ νοοῦμεν</span>, and <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-19.htm" title="But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in glory by Christ Jesus.">Php 4:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν ὑπερβάλλουσαν τῆς γνώσεως ἀγάπην τοῦ Χ</span>. Space forbids the enumeration of the many interpretations given. Wordsworth (<span class="ital">Prelude</span>, Bk. 14) defines this peace as “repose in moral judgments”.—<span class="greekheb">νοῦν</span> … <span class="greekheb">καρδίας</span> … <span class="greekheb">νοήματα</span>. <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, very much what we call “reason,” in Paul’s view, belongs to the life of the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. It is the highest power in that life, and affords, as it were, the material on which the Divine <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> can work. It remains in those who possess the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> as that part of the inner man which is exposed to earthly influences and relations. (See an admirable note in Ws[32].) <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span> is “a more undefined concept, side by side with <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>” (so Lüdemann, <span class="ital">Anthropol.</span>, p. 16 ff.). It has to do not merely with feelings but with will. <span class="greekheb">νοήματα</span> are products of the <span class="greekheb">νοῦς</span>, thoughts or purposes. Paul would probably regard them as being contained in the <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span>. The word is found five times in 2 Cor. and nowhere else in N.T.—<span class="greekheb">φρουρήσει</span>. A close parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a>, <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἐν δυνάμει Θεοῦ φρουρουμένους διὰ πίστεως εἰς σωτηρίαν</span>.

The peace which God gives, which flows from the sense of his most gracious presence, and consists in childlike confidence and trustful love. This peace passeth all understanding; its calm blessedness transcends the reach of human thought; it can be known only by the inner experience of the believer. The similar passage, Ephesians in 20, "Unto him that is able to do exceeding abundantly above all that we ask or think," seems decisive for the ordinary interpretation. Bishop Light-foot, Meyer, and others take another view of the passage: "Surpassing every device or counsel of man. <span class="accented">i.e.</span> which is far better, which produces a higher satisfaction, than all punctilious self-assertion, all anxious forethought." <span class="cmt_word">Shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus</span>; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</span> Peace shall guard - "a verbal paradox, for to guard is a warrior's duty" (Bishop Lightfoot). The peace of God abiding in the heart is a sure and trusty garrison, guarding it so that the evil spirit, once cast out, cannot return. The thoughts issue from the heart; for the heart, as commonly in the Hebrew Scriptures, is regarded as the seat of the intellect, not of feeling only. <span class="accented">In Christ Jesus</span>; in the sphere of his influence, his presence. True believers, abiding in Christ, realize his promise, "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Peace of God<p>As the antidote to anxiety, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-6.htm">Philippians 4:6</a>.<p>Which passeth all understanding (&#x3b7;&#788; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; &#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;).<p>Either, which passes all power of comprehension, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-20.htm">Ephesians 3:20</a>; or, better, which surpasses every (human) reason, in its power to relieve anxiety.
