(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-2.htm" title="And be not conformed to this world: but be you transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.">Romans 12:2</a>.)

It may be noted that most superstitions in the Church as to the spiritual value of either of these forms of sacrifice, have come from confusion between them and the true or propitiatory sacrifice.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But I have all - Margin, "or, have received." The phrase here is equivalent to, "I have received everything. I have all I want, and desire no more." He was entirely satisfied. What they had sent to him is, of course, now unknown.

He regarded it as an offering which they had made to God himself; and he was persuaded that he would regard it as acceptable to him. They had doubtless made the offering, not merely from personal friendship for Paul, but because he was a minister of Christ, and from love for his cause; and Paul felt assured that this offering would be acceptable to him; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-41.htm">Matthew 10:41-42</a>. The word "odor" refers properly to the pleasant fragrance produced in the temple by the burning of incense; notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-9.htm">Luke 1:9</a>.

The whole language here is taken from an act of worship; and the apostle regarded what he had received from the Philippians as in fact a thank-offering to God, and a presented with the spirit of true devotion to him. It was not, indeed, a formal act of worship; but it was acceptable to God as an expression of their regard for his cause.<p>A sacrifice acceptable - Acceptable to God; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm">Hebrews 13:16</a>; notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>.<p>Well-pleasing to God - Because it evinced a regard for true religion.

PHILIPPI AND THE EPISTLE. (Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a>)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From an essay by Prof. J. Agar Beet, in <span class="ital">The Expositor</span> (January, 1889), I extract the closing sentences:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“With this reply [the Epistle], a gift infinitely more precious than that he brought from Philippi, Epaphroditus starts on his homeward journey. The joy caused by his return, and the effect of this wonderful letter when first read in the Church at Philippi, are hidden from us. And we may almost say that with this letter the Church itself passes from our view. To-day, in silent meadows quiet cattle browse among the ruins which mark the site of what was once the flourishing Roman colony of Philippi, the home of the most attractive Church of the apostolic age. But the name and fame and spiritual influence of that Church will never pass. To myriads of men and women in every age and nation, the letter written in a dungeon at Rome and carried along the Egnatian Way by an obscure Christian messenger, has been a light Divine, and a cheerful guide along the most rugged paths in life. As I watch, and myself rejoice in, the brightness of that far-shining light, and glance at those silent ruins, I see fulfilled an ancient prophecy: <span class="ital">The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our God shall stand for ever</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Php 4:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀπέχω</span>) The apostle’s receipt.[58]—<span class="greekheb">περισσεύω</span>, <span class="ital">I abound</span>) Behold the contented and grateful mind!—<span class="greekheb">τὰ παρʼ ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">the things</span> (<span class="ital">which came</span>) <span class="ital">from you</span>) They had sent money or clothes and what might be serviceable.—<span class="greekheb">ὀσμὴν εὐωδίας</span>, <span class="ital">the odour of a sweet smell</span>) He describes their conduct by a beautiful figure.—<span class="greekheb">θυσίαν</span>, <span class="ital">a sacrifice</span>) <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-16.htm" title="But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.">Hebrews 13:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] ‘Apocha’ may either be his acknowledgment of having <span class="ital">received in full</span> the debt of kindness due to him from them, or else Beng. uses <span class="greekheb">ἀποχὴ</span> as Epictetus for <span class="ital">forbearance</span>, moderation in desires.
