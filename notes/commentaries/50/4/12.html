A Stoic might well have used these words. There is even a touch of the Stoical contempt in the word “to be full,” which properly applies to cattle, though frequently used of men in the New Testament. Perhaps, like all ascetics, they mostly knew how “to suffer need,” better than how “to abound.” But a Marcus Aurelius might have boldly claimed the knowledge of both.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I know both how to be abased - To be in circumstances of want.<p>And I know how to abound - To have an abundance. lie had been in circumstances where he had an ample supply for all his needs, and knew what it was to have enough. It requires as much grace to keep the heart right in prosperity, as it does in adversity, and perhaps more. Adversity, of itself, does something to keep the mind in a right state; prosperity does nothing.<p>Everywhere and in all things - In all my travels and imprisonments, and in reference to everything that occurs, I learn important lessons on these points.<p>I am instructed - The word used here - &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  memue&#772;mai - is one that is commonly used in relation to mysteries, and denoted being instructed in the secret doctrines that were taught in the ancient "mysteries" - Passow. In those mysteries, it was only the "initiated" who were made acquainted with the lessons that were taught there. Paul says that he had been initiated into the lessons taught by trials and by prosperity. The secret and important lessons which these schools of adversity are fitted to teach, he had had an ample opportunity of learning; and he had faithfully embraced the doctrines thus taught.<p>Both to be full - That is, he had learned to have an ample supply of his needs, and yet to observe the laws of temperance and soberness, and to cherish gratitude for the mercies which he had enjoyed.<p>And to be hungry - That is, to be in circumstances of want, and yet not to murmur or complain. He had learned to bear all this without discontent. This was then, as it is now, no easy lesson to learn; and it is not improper to suppose that, when Paul says that he had "been instructed" in this, even he means to say that it was only by degrees that he had acquired it. It is a lesson which we slowly learn, not to complain at the allotments of Providence; not to be envious at the prosperity of others; not to repine when our comforts are removed. There may be another idea suggested here. The condition of Paul was not always the same. He passed through great reverses. At one time he had abundance; then he was reduced to want; now he was in a state which might be regarded as affluent; then he was brought down to extreme poverty. Yesterday, he was poor and hungry; today, all his necessities are supplied.<p>Now, it is in these sudden reverses that grace is most needed, and in these rapid changes of life that it is most difficult to learn the lessons of calm contentment. People get accustomed to an even tenor of life, no matter what it is, and learn to shape their temper and their calculations according to it. But these lessons of philosophy vanish when they pass suddenly from one extreme to another, and find their condition in life suddenly changed. The garment that was adapted to weather of an uniform temperature, whether of heat or cold, fails to be suited to our needs when these transitions rapidly succeed each other. Such changes are constantly occurring in life. God tries his people, not by a steady course of prosperity, or by long-continued and uniform adversity, but by transition from the one to the other; and it often happens that the grace which would have been sufficient for either continued prosperity or adversity, would fail in the transition from the one to the other.<p>Hence, new grace is imparted for this new form of trial, and new traits of Christian character are developed in these rapid transitions in life, as some of the most beautiful exhibitions of the laws of matter are brought out in the transitions produced in chemistry. The rapid changes from heat to cold, or from a solid to a gaseous state, develop properties before unknown, and acquaint us much more intimately with the wonderful works of God. The gold or the diamond, unsubjected to the action of intense heat, and to the changes produced by the powerful agents brought to bear on them, might have continued to shine with steady beauty and brilliancy; but we should never have witnessed the special beauty and brilliancy which may be produced in rapid chemical changes. And so there is many a beautiful trait of character which would never have been known by either continued prosperity or adversity. There might have been always a beautiful exhibition of virtue and piety, but not tidal special manifestation which is produced in the transitions from the one to the other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. abased&#8212;in low circumstances (2Co 4:8; 6:9, 10).<p>everywhere&#8212;rather, "in each, and in all things" [Alford].<p>instructed&#8212;in the secret.

It has no immediate connexion with <span class="greekheb">μεμύημαι</span> (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> a similar expression <span class="greekheb">τῷ παντί</span> in Xen., <span class="ital">Hell.</span>, 7, 5, 12, and <span class="greekheb">τοῖς</span> or <span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν</span> in Thucyd., Soph., etc.).—<span class="greekheb">μεμύημαι</span>. The verb was originally used of one initiated into the Mysteries. It came (like our own “initiated”) to lose its technical sense. But the word probably implies a difficult process to be gone through. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm" title="The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will show them his covenant.">Psalm 25:14</a> : “The <span class="ital">secret</span> of the Lord is with them that fear Him, and He will show them His covenant” (Vaughan), and <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/8-4.htm" title="For she is privy to the mysteries of the knowledge of God, and a lover of his works.">Wis 8:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">μύστις γάρ ἐστιν τῆς τοῦ Θεοῦ ἐπιστήμης</span>. In later ecclesiastical usage <span class="greekheb">ὁ μεμυημένος</span> = a baptised Christian (an instructive hint as to the growth of dogma). See Anrich, <span class="ital">Das Antike Mysterienwesen</span>, p. 158. <span class="greekheb">μεμύ</span>. goes closely with the infinitives following. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Alciphron, 2, 4 <span class="ital">ad fin.</span>, <span class="greekheb">κυβερνᾶν μυηθήσομαι</span>.—<span class="greekheb">χορτάζεσθαι</span> is a strong word, used originally of the feeding of animals, which gradually became colourless in the colloquial language (see <span class="ital">Sources of N.T. Greek</span>, p. 82).—<span class="greekheb">πεινᾶν</span> should be written without <span class="ital">iota subscript</span>. It is contracted here with <span class="greekheb">α</span> as usually in later Greek. See Phrynichus (ed. Lobeck), 61, 204. So always in LXX.—<span class="greekheb">ὑστερεῖσθαι</span> has the rare meaning “to be in want” (absol.), or rather (in middle), “to feel want”. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>, and esp[57]. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/11-11.htm" title="There is one that laboureth, and taketh pains, and maketh haste, and is so much the more behind.">Sir 11:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἔστιν κοπῶν καὶ πονῶν καὶ σπεύδων</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τόσῳ μᾶλλον ὑστερεῖται</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[56] Ellicott.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[57] especially.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/4.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. <span class="ital">to be abased</span>] “To be <span class="ital">low</span>,” in resources and comforts.

The Greek verb is akin to the words, <span class="ital">mystês, mystêrion</span>, and means to initiate a candidate into the hidden tenets and worship of the “Mysteries”; systems of religion in the Hellenic world derived perhaps from prehistoric times, and jealously guarded by their votaries. Admission to their <span class="ital">arcana</span>, as into Freemasonry now, was sought even by the most cultured; with the special hope, apparently, of a peculiar immunity from evil in this life and the next. See Smith’s <span class="ital">Dict. of Greek and Roman Antiquities</span>. It is evident that St Paul’s adoption of such a word for the discovery of the “open secrets” of the Gospel is beautifully suggestive. Lightfoot remarks that we have the same sort of adoption in his frequent use (and our Lord’s, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-11.htm" title="He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.">Matthew 13:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/4-11.htm" title="And he said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God: but to them that are without, all these things are done in parables:">Mark 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-10.htm" title="And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they might not see, and hearing they might not understand.">Luke 8:10</a>; and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-20.htm" title="The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks.

The repeated mention of the <span class="ital">abounding</span> is consonant with the condition of Paul, who then <span class="ital">abounded</span> in consequence of the liberality of the Philippians. <span class="ital">Abasement</span> had preceded, and <span class="ital">need</span> would perhaps follow.

St. Paul had experience both of sorrow and of joy, both of distress and of comfort; he knew how to bear himself in both, because his chiefest joy was "in the Lord." This abiding joy raised him above the vicissitudes of this mortal state, and gave him an <span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>, a Christian independence, which enabled him to act becomingly both in adversity and in prosperity. <span class="cmt_word">Everywhere and in all things I am instructed</span>; literally, as R.V., <span class="accented">in everything and in all things</span>; as we say, "in each and all," in every condition separately and in all collectively.

The Greek <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x1f7b;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span> means properly, "I have been' initiated." It is a word adapted from the old Greek mysteries; comp. B.C.ngel, "Disciplina arcana imbutus sum, ignota mundo." St. Paul represents the advanced Christian life as a mystery, the secrets of which are taught by God. the Holy Ghost to the soul that longs to prove in its own personal experience "what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God." St. Paul frequently uses the word <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span>, mystery, for the truths once hidden but now brought to light by the gospel. <span class="cmt_word">Both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need.</span> The word rendered "to be full" (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>) is strictly used of animals, and means "to be foddered;" in the New Testament and later Greek it is used also of men, without any depreciatory significance, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm">Matthew 5:6</a>, "<span class="accented">They</span> shall be filled (<span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>)." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I am instructed (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., have I learned the secret.
