St. Paul had accepted the offerings as made, not to himself, but to the God whose minister he was. Hence he adds, “my God”—the God, whom ye serve in serving me.<p><span class= "bld">All your need.</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">every need of yours, </span>spiritual and temporal.<p><span class= "bld">In glory.</span>—We have already noticed the constant reference to “glory” in the Epistles of the Captivity. Where the word relates to God in Himself, His “glory” is His true nature as manifested to His creatures; where it refers to man, “glory” is the perfection of man’s nature in the communion with God in Heaven. Here the latter sense is obviously to be taken. The “supplying of every need out of the riches” of God’s love can only have its consummation in the “glory” of the future. That it is “in Christ Jesus” is a matter of course; for He is to “change even our body of humiliation to be fashioned like unto the body of His glory” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-21.htm" title="Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like to his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things to himself.">Philippians 3:21</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:10-19 It is a good work to succour and help a good minister in trouble. The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But my God shall supply all your need - That is, "You have shown your regard for me as a friend of God, by sending to me in my distress, and I have confidence that, in return for all this, God will supply all your needs, when you are in circumstances of necessity." Paul's confidence in this seems not to have been founded on any express revelation; but on the general principle that God would regard their offering with favor. Nothing is lost, even in the present life, by doing good. In thousands of instances it is abundantly repaid. The benevolent are not usually poor; and if they are, God often raises up for them benefactions, and sends supplies in a manner as unexpected, and hearing proofs of divine interposition as decided, as when supplies were sent by the ravens to the prophet.<p>According to his riches in glory - see the notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-16.htm">Ephesians 3:16</a>. The word "riches" here means, His abundant fullness; His possessing all things; His inexhaustible ability to supply their needs. The phrase "in glory," is probably to he connected with the following phrase, "in Christ Jesus;" and means that the method of imparting supplies to people was through Jesus Christ, and was a glorious method; or, that it was done in a glorious manner. It is such an expression as Paul is accustomed to use, when speaking of what God does. He is not satisfied with saying simply that it is so; but connects with it the idea that whatever God does is done in a way worthy of himself, and so as to illustrate his own perfections.<p>In Christ Jesus - By the medium of Christ; or through him. All the favors that Paul expected for himself, or his fellow-men, he believed would be conferred through the Redeemer. Even the supply of our temporal needs comes to us through the Saviour. Were it not for the atonement, there is no more reason to suppose that blessings would be conferred upon people than that they would be on fallen angels. For them no atonement has been made; and at the hand of justice they have received only wretchedness and woe. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. my&#8212;Paul calls God here "my God," to imply that God would reward their bounty to His servant, by "fully supplying" (translate so, literally, fill to the full) their every "need" (2Co 9:8), even as they had "fully" supplied his "need" (Php 4:16, 18).

The prominent thought here is, surely, that of temporal poverty. Cp. particularly <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-8.htm" title="And God is able to make all grace abound toward you; that you, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to every good work:">2 Corinthians 9:8</a>, where the <span class="ital">first</span> reference seems to be to God’s ability to supply to His self-denying servants always more from which they may still spare and give.

Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-4.htm" title="Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.">Romans 6:4</a>, and note in this Series, for a similar use of the word “glory.”—Bp Lightfoot prefers to connect “<span class="ital">shall supply, in glory, your need, according to His riches</span>,” and he explains the thought to be, “shall supply your need <span class="ital">by placing you in glory</span>.” But we venture to think this construction needlessly difficult.—Anything in which God is “glorified” (see e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-24.htm" title="And they glorified God in me.">Galatians 1:24</a>) is, as it were, a reflection of His holy glory, and a result of it.
