It is probably to this gift that reference is made; though it is of course possible that some contribution may have reached him at the time of his actual departure in haste after the persecution at Berœa.<p><span class= "bld">Communicated with me as concerning . . .</span>—The metaphor here is drawn from commercial transaction.

For if the Gentiles have been made partakers of their spiritual things, their duty is also to minister to them in carnal things.">Romans 15:27</a>.) In the one respect he had all to give, and they to receive; in the other the relations were reversed. But if there be such allusion, it is kept in <span class= "ital">the</span> background. The prominent idea is of the Philippians, and of them alone, as givers.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/4.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">GIFTS GIVEN, SEED SOWN</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only....">Php 4:15-19</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul loved the Philippians too well and was too sure of their love to be conscious of any embarrassment in expressing his thanks for money help. His thanks are profuse and long drawn out. Our present text still strikes the note of grateful acknowledgment. It gives us a little glimpse into earlier instances of their liberality, and beautifully suggests that as they had done to him so God would do to them, and that their liberality was in a fashion a prophecy, because it was in some measure an imitation, of God’s liberality. He had just said ‘I am full, having received the things which were sent from you,’ and now he says, ‘My God shall fill full all your needs.’ The use of the same word in these two connections is a piece of what one would call the very ingenuity of graceful courtesy, if it were not something far deeper, even the utterance of a loving and self-forgetting heart.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We may note here Paul’s money relations with the churches.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We know that he habitually lived by his own labour. He could call to witness the assembled elders at Ephesus, when he declared that ‘these hands ministered unto my necessities,’ and could propose himself as an illustration of the words of the Lord Jesus, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ He firmly holds the right of Christian teachers to be supported by the churches, and vehemently insists upon it in the First Epistle to the Corinthians. But he waives the right in his own case, and passionately insists that it were better for him rather to die than that any man should make his glorying void. He will not use to the full his right in the Gospel ‘that he may make a Gospel without charge,’ but when needed he gladly accepted money gifts, as he did from the Philippians. In our text he points back to an earlier instance of this. The history of that instance we may briefly recall. After his indignities and imprisonment in Philippi he went straight to Thessalonica, stayed there a short time till a riot drove him to take refuge in Berea, whence again he had to flee, and guided by brethren reached Athens. There he was left alone, and his guides went back to Macedonia to send on Silas and Timothy. From Athens he went to Corinth, and there was rejoined by them. According to our text, ‘in the beginning of the Gospel,’ that is, of course, its beginning in Philippi, they relieved him twice in Thessalonica, and if the words in our text which date the Philippians’ gift may be read ‘when I had departed from Macedonia,’ we should have here another reference to the same incident mentioned in 2 Corinthians, chap. 11: 8-9, where he speaks of being in want there, and having ‘the measure of my want’ supplied by the brethren who came from Macedonia. The coincidence of these two incidental references hid away, as it were, confirms the historical truthfulness of both Epistles. And if we take into view the circumstances in which he was placed in Thessalonica and at the beginning of his stay in Corinth, his needing and receiving such aid is amply accounted for. Once again, after a long interval, when he was a prisoner in Rome, and probably unable to work for his maintenance, their care of him flourished again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the present circumstances of our churches, it seems necessary that the right which Paul so strongly asserted should, for the most part, not be waived, but the only true way of giving and receiving as between minister and people is when it is a matter not of payment but a gift. When it is an expression of sympathy and affection on both sides, the relationship is pleasant and may be blessed. When it comes to be a business transaction, and is to be measured by the rules applicable to such, it goes far to destroy some of the sweetest bonds, and to endanger a preacher’s best influence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The lofty view here taken of such service.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is ‘the fruit that increaseth to your account.’ Fruit, which as it were is put to their credit in the account-book of heaven, but it is called by Paul by a sacreder name as being an odour of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God, in which metaphor all the sacred ideas of yielding up precious things to God and of the sacred fire that consumed the offering or brought to bear on the prosaic material gift.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The principle which the Apostle here lays down in reference to a money gift has, of course, a much wider application, and is as true about all Christian acts. We need not be staggered at the emphasis with which Paul states the truths of their acceptableness and rewardableness, but in order fully to understand the ground of his assurance we must remember that in his view the root of all such fruit increasing to our account, and of everything which can claim to be an odour of a sweet smell well pleasing to God, is love to Christ, and the renewal of our nature by the spirit of God dwelling in us. In us there dwells no good thing. It is only as we abide in Him and His words abide in us that we bear much fruit. Separate from Him we can do nothing. If our works are ever to smell sweet to God, they must be done for Christ, and in a very profound and real sense, done by Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The essential character of all work which has the right to be called good, and which is acceptable to God, is sacrifice. The one exhortation which takes the place and more than fills the place of all other commandments, and is enforced by the motive which takes the place, and more than takes the place of all other motives, is, ‘I beseech you by the mercies of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice.’ It is works which in the intention of the doer are offered to Him, and in which therefore there is a surrender of our own wills, or tastes, or inclinations, or passions, or possessions, that yield to Him an odour of a sweet smell. The old condition which touched the chivalrous heart of David has to be repeated by us in regard to any work which we can ever hope to make well pleasing to God; ‘I will not offer burnt offerings unto the Lord my God which cost me nothing.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is a spurious humility which treats all the works of good men as filthy rags, but such a false depreciation is contradicted by Christ’s ‘Well done, good and faithful servant.’ It is true that all our deeds are stained and imperfect, but if they are offered on the altar which He provides, it will sanctify the giver and the gift. He is the great Aaron who makes atonement for the iniquity of our holy things. And whilst we are stricken silent with thankfulness for the wonderful mercy of His gracious allowance, we may humbly hope that His ‘Well done’ will be spoken of us, and may labour, not without a foretaste that we do not labour in vain, that ‘whether present or absent we may be well pleasing to Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The fruit is here supposed to be growing, that is, of course, in another life. We need not insist that the service and sacrifice and work of earth, if the motive be right, tell in a man’s condition after death. It is not all the same how Christian men live; some gain ten talents, some five, and some two, and the difference between them is not always as the parable represents it, a difference in the original endowment. An entrance may be given into the eternal kingdom, and yet it may not be an abundant entrance.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The gift that supplies the givers.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul has nothing to bestow, but he serves a great God who will see to it that no man is the poorer by helping His servants. The king’s honour is concerned in not letting a poor man suffer by lodging and feeding his retainers. The words here suggest to us the source from which our need may be filled full, as an empty vessel might be charged to the brim with some precious liquid, the measure or limit of the fulness, and the channel by which we receive it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul was so sure that the Philippians’ needs would all be satisfied, because he knew that his own had been; he is generalising from his own case, and that, I think, is at all events part of the reason why he says with much emphasis, ‘ My God. As He has done to me He will do to you,’ but even without the ‘my,’ the great name contains in itself a promise and its seal. ‘God will supply just because He is God’; that is what His name means--infinite fulness and infinite self-communicativeness and delight in giving. But is not so absolutely unlimited a promise as this convicted of complete unreality when contrasted with the facts of any life, even of the most truly Christian or the most outwardly happy? Its contradiction of the grim facts of experience is not to be slurred over by restricting it to religious needs only. The promise needs the eye of Faith to interpret the facts of experience, and to let nothing darken the clear vision that if any seeming need is left by God unfilled, it is not an indispensable need. If we do not get what we want we may be quite sure that we do not need it. The axiom of Christian faith is that whatever we do not obtain we do not require. Very desirable things may still not be necessary. Let us limit our notions of necessity by the facts of God’s giving, and then we, too, shall have learned, in whatsoever state we are, therein to be content. When the Apostle says that God shall fill all our need full up to the brim, was he contemplating only such necessities as God could supply through outward gifts? Surely not. God Himself is the filler and the only filler of a human heart, and it is by this impartation of Himself and by nothing else that He bestows upon us the supply of our needs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Unless we have been initiated into this deepest and yet simplest secret of life, it will be full of gnawing pain and unfulfilled longings. Unless we have learned that our needs are like the cracks in the parched ground, cups to hold the rain from heaven, doors by which God Himself can come to us, we shall dwell for ever in a dry and thirsty land. God Himself is the only satisfier of the soul. ‘Whom have I in heaven but Thee, and there is none upon earth that’--if I am not a fool--’I desire side by side with Thee?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But Paul here sets forth in very bold words the measure or limits of the divine supply of our need. It is ‘according to His riches in glory.’ Then, all of God belongs to me, and the whole wealth of His aggregated perfections is available for stopping the crannies of my heart and filling its emptiness. My emptiness corresponds with His fulness as some concavity does with the convexity that fits into it, and the whole that He is waits to fill and to satisfy me. There is no limit really to what a man may have of God except the limitless limit of the infinite divine nature, but on the other hand this great promise is not fulfilled all at once, and whilst the actual limit is the boundlessness of God, there is a working limit, so to speak, a variable one, but a very real one. The whole riches of God’s glory are available for us, but only so much of the boundless store as we desire and are at present capable of taking in will belong to us now. What is the use of owning half a continent if the owner lives on an acre of it and grows what he wants there, and has never seen the broad lands that yet belong to him? Nothing hinders a man from indefinitely increased possession of a growing measure of God, except his own arbitrarily narrowed measure of desire and capacity. Therefore it becomes a solemn question for each of us, Am I day by day becoming more and more fit to possess more of God, and enjoy more of the God whom I possess? In Him we have each ‘a potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice.’ Do we growingly realise that boundless possibility?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The channel by which that boundless supply is to reach us is distinctly set forth here. All these riches are stored up ‘in Christ Jesus.’ A deep lake may be hidden away in the bosom of the hills that would pour blessing and fertility over a barren land if it could find a channel down into the plains, but unless there be a river flowing out of it, its land-locked waters might as well be dried up. When Paul says ‘riches in glory,’ he puts them up high above our reach, but when he adds ‘in Christ Jesus,’ he brings them all down amongst us. In Him is ‘infinite riches in a narrow room.’ If we are in Him then we are beside our treasure, and have only to put out our hands and take the wealth that is lying there. All that we need is ‘in Christ,’ and if we are in Christ it is all close at our sides.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Then the question comes to be, ‘Am I thus near my wealth, and can I get at it whenever I want it, as I want it, and as much as I want of it?’ We can if we will. The path is easy to define, though our slothfulness find it hard to tread. That man is in Christ who dwells with Him by faith, whose heart is by love plunged in His love, who daily seeks to hold communion with Him amid the distractions of life, and who in practical submission obeys His will. If thus we trust, if thus we love, if thus we hold fast to Him, and if thus we link Him with all our activities in the world, need will cease to grow, and will only be an occasion for God’s gift. ‘Delight thyself in the Lord,’ and then the heart’s desires being set upon Him, ‘He will give thee the desire of thy heart.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul says to us ‘My God shall supply all your need.’ Let us answer, ‘The Lord is my Shepherd, I shall not want.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-15.htm" title="Now you Philippians know also, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church communicated with me as concerning giving and receiving, but you only....">Php 4:15-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Ye know that in the beginning of the gospel </span>— When it was first preached at Philippi; <span class="ital">no church </span>— No Christian society, as such; <span class="ital">communicated with me </span>— In the matter of <span class="ital">giving </span>me money, <span class="ital">and </span>of my <span class="ital">receiving </span>money from them; <span class="ital">but ye only </span>— I received money from no church but yours. <span class="ital">Not because I desire a gift, </span>&c. — I would not have you think that I commend your liberality merely out of respect to myself; but <span class="ital">I desire fruit, </span>&c. — I do it chiefly out of respect to you; that you may do that which may turn to your everlasting advantage. <span class="ital">But l have all </span>— So also the Vulgate reads the clause; but the original expression, <span class="greekheb">απεχω παντα</span>, according to Estius, may be translated, <span class="ital">I have from you all things; </span>that is, my wants are amply supplied by you; <span class="ital">and I abound </span>— I have more than sufficient for my present state; <span class="ital">having received of Epaphroditus the things sent from you </span>— Besides money, the Philippians may have sent to the apostle clothes and other necessaries: <span class="ital">an odour of a sweet smell </span>— A service wherewith God is well pleased.

The nature of true Christian sympathy, is not only to feel concern for our friends in their troubles, but to do what we can to help them. The apostle was often in bonds, imprisonments, and necessities; but in all, he learned to be content, to bring his mind to his condition, and make the best of it. Pride, unbelief, vain hankering after something we have not got, and fickle disrelish of present things, make men discontented even under favourable circumstances. Let us pray for patient submission and hope when we are abased; for humility and a heavenly mind when exalted. It is a special grace to have an equal temper of mind always. And in a low state not to lose our comfort in God, nor distrust his providence, nor take any wrong course for our own supply. In a prosperous condition not to be proud, or secure, or worldly. This is a harder lesson than the other; for the temptations of fulness and prosperity are more than those of affliction and want. The apostle had no design to urge them to give more, but to encourage such kindness as will meet a glorious reward hereafter. Through Christ we have grace to do what is good, and through him we must expect the reward; and as we have all things by him, let us do all things for him, and to his glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the beginning of the gospel - "At the time when I first preached the gospel to you; or when the gospel began its benign influence on your hearts."<p>When I departed from Macedonia - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm">Acts 17:14</a>. The last place that Paul visited in Macedonia, at that time, was Berea. There a tumult was excited by the Jews, and it was necessary for him to go away. He left Macedonia to go to Athens; and left it in haste, amidst scenes of persecution, and when he needed sympathizing aid. At that time, as well as when he was in Thessalonica <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/17-1.htm">Acts 17:1-10</a>, he needed the assistance of others to supply his wants; and he says that aid was not withheld.

Comp. Clement. <span class="ital">Cor</span>. I. 47. An epexegetical more precise definition of this expression—which does not betray the hand of a later author (Hinsch)—for the date intended is: <span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἐξῆλθον ἀπὸ Μακεδ</span>., <span class="ital">when I departed from Macedonia</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-14.htm" title="And then immediately the brothers sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus stayed there still.">Acts 17:14</a>.

Doubtless the money which Paul subsequently received in Corinth (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2 Corinthians 11:9</a>) through Macedonian delegates was sent, if not exclusively, at least <span class="ital">jointly</span> by the Philippians, so that they thereby gave <span class="ital">continued</span> active proof of the fellowship <span class="greekheb">εἰς λόγον δόσ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λήψ</span>., into which they had <span class="ital">entered</span> with the apostle at his very departure.

T. 343]); for the latter would be the more unwarranted in the context, seeing that Paul himself by <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἀρχῇ τοῦ εὐαγγ</span>. carries them back to the earliest time possible, and indeed afterwards (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-16.htm" title="For even in Thessalonica you sent once and again to my necessity.">Php 4:16</a>) to a period even antecedent to the <span class="greekheb">ὅτε ἐξῆλθον</span>.

This <span class="ital">mutual</span> account-keeping, in which the <span class="greekheb">δόσις</span> on the one part, agrees with the <span class="greekheb">λῆψις</span> on the other, is the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία εἰς λόγον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. It is true that in this case no <span class="ital">money</span>-amount is entered in the account of the Philippians under the heading of <span class="greekheb">λῆψις</span>, or the account of the apostle under the heading of <span class="greekheb">δόσις</span>; instead of this, however, comes in the <span class="ital">blessing</span>, which the readers were to receive <span class="ital">from their gifts of love</span>, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-17.htm" title="Not because I desire a gift: but I desire fruit that may abound to your account.">Php 4:17</a>, as if it were an income corresponding to this expenditure, and coming in from it. We are therefore not justified in adopting <span class="ital">the</span> view, that <span class="greekheb">δόσ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">λῆψ</span>. apply <span class="ital">to Paul alone</span> (Schrader), or that <span class="greekheb">δόσεως</span> applies to the <span class="ital">Philippians</span> and <span class="greekheb">λήψ</span>. to <span class="ital">Paul</span> (“Ego sum in <span class="ital">vestris expensi</span> tabulis, vos in <span class="ital">meis accepti</span>,” Grotius; comp.
