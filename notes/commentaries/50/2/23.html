Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>So soon as I shall see how it will go with me - Paul was a prisoner at Rome, and there was not a little uncertainty whether he would be condemned or acquitted. He was, it is commonly supposed, in fact released on the first trial; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>. He now felt that he would soon be able to send Timothy to them at any rate. If he was condemned and put to death, he would, of course, have no further occasion for his services, and if he was released from his present troubles and dangers, he could spare him for a season to go and visit the churches. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. so soon as I shall see&#8212;that is, so soon as I shall have known for certain.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Him therefore I hope to send presently; </span> seeing the matter was thus, he thought not of any other to employ in the service of their faith, but hoped, i.e. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the Lord Jesus</span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.">Philippians 2:19</a></span>, in a short time after his present writing, to send this excellent, humble, and approved young man, who would naturally care for their concerns, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">So soon as I shall see how it will go with me; </span> even without any delay, (though as yet, to accompany Epaphroditus, he could not spare him, who was so useful to him in his bonds, to take care for things necessary to the propagation of the gospel, in the ample city of Rome), from the hour he should come to a certainty what would be the issue of his present imprisonment, which if it should end in his being offered up, he had satisfied them before, as it would be for his own advantage, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-21.htm" title="For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.">Philippians 1:21</a></span>, so, by the providence of God, no disservice to their faith, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Philippians 2:17</a>,18</span>; from which, with ready submission to God’s will, whatever occurred, it seems he had a greater inclination to conceive a good hope of freedom. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/philippians/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Him therefore I hope to send presently,....
