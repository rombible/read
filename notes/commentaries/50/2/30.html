It is possible that (as Bishop Wordsworth suggests) there may be allusion to the caution money, staked in a cause to show that it was not frivolous and vexatious, and forfeited in case of loss; and that Epaphroditus, risking his life through over-exertion in the cause of St. Paul, as a prisoner awaiting trial, is therefore said to have <span class= "ital">gambled with his life.</span> This would give a special appropriateness to the allusion. But it is, perhaps, too artificial, and the figure is in itself intelligible and striking.<p><span class= "bld">To supply your lack of service.</span>—There is not in the original the touch of reproach which our version may seem to imply. Epaphroditus’ presence and activity are said to have “filled up the one thing wanting” to make the service of the Philippians effective for its purpose.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Because for the work of Christ - That is, either by exposing himself in his journey to see the apostle in Rome, or by his labors there.<p>Not regarding his life - There is a difference in the mss. here, so great that it is impossible now to determine which is the true reading, though the sense is not materially affected. The common reading of the Greek text is, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  paraboleusamenos; literally "misconsulting, not consulting carefully, not taking pains."

This reading suits the connection, and is generally regarded as the correct one.<p>To supply your lack of service toward me - Not that they had been indifferent to him, or inattentive to his wants, for he does not mean to blame them; but they had not had an opportunity to send to his relief (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm">Philippians 4:10</a>), and Epaphroditus therefore made a special journey to Rome on his account. He came and rendered to him the service which they could not do in person; and what the church would have done, if Paul had been among them, he performed in their name and on their behalf.<p>Remarks On <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2.htm">Philippians 2</a><p>1. Let us learn to esteem others as they ought to be; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. Every person who is virtuous and pious has some claim to esteem. He has a reputation which is valuable to him and to the church, and we should not withhold respect from him. It is one evidence, also, of true humility and of right feeling, when we esteem them as better than ourselves, and when we are willing to see them honored, and are willing to sacrifice our own ease to promote their welfare. It is one of the instinctive promptings of true humility to feel that other persons are better than we are.<p>2. We should not he disappointed or mortified if others think little of us - if we are not brought into prominent notice among people; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. We profess to have a low opinion of ourselves, if we are Christians, and we ought to have; and why should we be chagrined and mortified if others have the same opinion of us? Why should we not be willing that they should accord in judgment with us in regard to ourselves?<p>3. We should be willing to occupy our appropriate place in the church; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm">Philippians 2:3</a>. That is true humility; and why should anyone be unwilling to be esteemed just as he ought to be? Pride makes us miserable, and is the grand thing that stands in the way of the influence of the gospel on our hearts. No one can become a Christian who is not willing to occupy just the place which he ought to occupy; to take the lowly position as a penitent which he ought to take; and to have God regard and treat him just as he ought to be treated. The first, second, and third thing in religion is humility; and no one ever becomes a Christian who is not willing to take the lowly condition of a child.<p>4. We should feel a deep interest in the welfare of others; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-4.htm">Philippians 2:4</a>. People are by nature selfish, and it is the design of religion to make them benevolent. They seek their own interests by nature, and the gospel would teach them to regard the welfare of others. If we are truly under the influence of religion, there is not a member of the church in whom we should not feel an interest, and whose welfare we should not strive to promote as far as we have opportunity. And we may have opportunity every day. It is an easy matter to do good to others. A kind word, or even a kind look, does good; and who so poor that he cannot render this? Every day that we live, we come in contact with some who may be benefited by our example, our advice, or our alms; and every day, therefore, may be closed with the feeling that we have not lived in vain.<p>5. Let us in all things look to the example of Christ; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm">Philippians 2:5</a>. He came that he might be an example; and he was exactly such an example as we need. We may be always sure that we are right when we follow his example and possess his spirit. We cannot be so sure that we are right in any other way. He came to be our model in all things, and in all the relations of life:<p>(a) He showed us what the law of God requires of us.<p>(b) lie showed us what we should aim to be, and what human nature would be if it were wholly under the influence of religion.<p>(c) lie showed us what true religion is, for it is just such as was seen in his life.<p>(d) he showed us how to act in our treatment of mankind.<p>(e) he showed us how to bear the ills of poverty, and want, and pain, and temptation, and reproach, from the world. We should learn to manifest the same spirit in suffering which he did, for then we are sure we are right.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. for the work of Christ&#8212;namely, the bringing of a supply to me, the minister of Christ.

B. Lightfoot, Hofmann, and others, have preferred <span class="greekheb">παραβολ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ψ</span>. The latter has the authority of A B D E F G <span class="greekheb">א</span>, 177, 178, 179 in its favour, as well as the support of the Itala by “parabolatus est de anima sua,” and of Vulgate, Aeth., Pelagius, by “tradens (Ambrosiaster: in interitum tradens)animam suam.” Since <span class="greekheb">βολεύεσθαι</span> was unknown to the copyists, whilst <span class="greekheb">βουλεύεσθαι</span> was very current, instead of the one <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγόμ</span>. another crept in, the form of which, on account of the prevalence of the simple word, had nothing offensive. <span class="greekheb">παραβολεύεσθαι</span>, which is nowhere certainly preserved (in opposition to Wetstein’s quotations from the Fathers, see Matthiae, ed. min. p. 341 f., and Reiche, Comment, crit. p. 220 f.), is formed from the very current classical word <span class="greekheb">παράβολος</span>, putting at stake, venturesome, and is therefore equivalent to <span class="greekheb">παράβολον εἶναι</span>, to be venturous, to be an adventurer, as <span class="greekheb">περπερεύεσθαι</span> equivalent to <span class="greekheb">πέρπερον εἶναι</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-4.htm" title="Charity suffers long, and is kind; charity envies not; charity braggs not itself, is not puffed up,">1 Corinthians 13:4</a>), <span class="greekheb">ἀλογεύεσθαι</span> equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἄλογον εἶναι</span> (Cic.

See more such verbs in Lobeck, ad Phryn. p. 67, and comp. generally Kühner, I. p. 695, II. 1, p. 98.

How delicate and winning, and at the same time how enlisting their grateful sympathy in the fate of Epaphroditus, was it to represent the absence of the Philippians as something that <span class="ital">had been lacking</span> in that <span class="greekheb">λειτουργία</span>, and therefore, as something which Paul had <span class="ital">missed</span>, to supply which, as <span class="ital">representative</span> of the church, the man had (as his deadly sickness had actually shown) hazarded his life! He did not therefore contract the illness <span class="ital">on his journey to Rome</span> (de Wette, Weiss, and older expositors), as Hofmann thinks, who represents him as arriving there <span class="ital">in the hot season of the year;</span> but through his exertions <span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ ἔργον</span> <span class="ital">in Rome itself</span> during his sojourn there, when his sickness showed that he had risked his life in order to bring the offering of the Philippians, and thus compensate the apostle for the absence of the church.

The true reading is very difficult to determine with such a conflict of authorities. We are inclined to believe that <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἔργ</span>. stood alone as in C.

What risk did he run? Hfm[14]. suggests that his illness was produced by his arrival in Rome during the hot season of the year. Chr[15]. thinks of danger at the hands of Nero. Wohl[16]. supposes that his illness was the result of his severe missionary labours in Rome. May it be that the Apostle was now confined in a far more unwholesome bondage than before (one of the noisome State-prisons? See <span class="ital">Introduction</span>), and that the assiduous services of Epaphrod. to him there, brought on this severe illness? We believe that this interpretation is justified by the next words <span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑστέρ</span>.… <span class="greekheb">λειτ</span>. In what was their service towards the Apostle lacking? Evidently in nothing save their own personal presence and personal care of him.

(C) omits <span class="ital">“of Christ”;</span> and some other evidence is for “<span class="ital">of the Lord</span>” instead. R.V. retains the reading of A.V., mentioning in the margin the reading “<span class="ital">of the Lord</span>.” Alford and Lightfoot advocate the omission.—For the phrase “<span class="ital">the work</span>,” used without further definition, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">he was nigh unto death</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">he drew near, up to death</span>,” a peculiar but unmistakable expression.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">not regarding</span> his <span class="ital">life</span>] R.V., <span class="bld">hazarding his life</span>. The two renderings represent each a different reading, the difference lying in the presence or absence of a single letter in the Greek (<span class="ital">parabo(u)leusamenos</span>). On the whole that represented by R.V. has the better support. In the more ancient Latin Version this Greek word is almost transliterated:—<span class="ital">parabolatus de animâ suâ;</span> words which might almost be rendered, “having played the desperado with his life.” The verb (found here only) is formed on a common Greek verb of which one meaning is “to wager in a game of chance,” and so to run a risk. Bp Light-foot renders here, “<span class="ital">having gambled with his life</span>.”—From the same root comes the ecclesiastical word (Greek and Latin) <span class="ital">parabolanus</span>, a member of a “minor order” devoted to nursing the infected, and similar hazardous duties. The order originated in Constantine’s time. Unhappily it soon degenerated into a notoriously turbulent sort of club.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">“His life”:</span>—lit., “<span class="ital">his soul</span>.” For the very frequent use of the Greek word <span class="ital">psychê</span> in the sense of bodily life cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-20.htm" title="Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the young child's life.">Matthew 2:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to supply your lack</span> &c.] More lit., “<span class="ital">that he might fill up your deficiency in the ministration designed for me</span>.” “<span class="ital">Your</span>” is slightly emphatic. Obviously, the Apostle means no reproof to the Philippians, whose “ministration” of supplies he so warmly appreciates below (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity....">Php 4:10-19</a>). He means that they, <span class="ital">as a community</span>, were of course unable to aid him by a personal visit, without which however their “ministration” would have “lacked” a necessary condition of success. That condition Epaphroditus had supplied; he had undertaken the journey, and doubtless had thrown himself at Rome into the Apostle’s interests and efforts. And somehow, whether by accidents on the journey, or by risks run at Rome, or by both, he had incurred dangerous illness.—See for a close parallel to the language here <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-17.htm" title="I am glad of the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus: for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied.">1 Corinthians 16:17</a>; and cp. the important phraseology of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-24.htm" title=" Who now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body's sake, which is the church:">Colossians 1:24</a>, and notes there.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm" title="Because for the work of Christ he was near to death, not regarding his life, to supply your lack of service toward me.">Php 2:30</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μέχρι θανάτου</span>, <span class="ital">even unto death</span>) This appertains to the comparison of duties [to the question of the prior claim among comparative duties]. To minister to Paul, seems in itself to be a matter of somewhat less importance than the danger to the life of Epaphroditus, who however most rightly purchased by this disadvantage [the danger to his life] that important benefit [the glad reception at Philippi, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-29.htm" title="Receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness; and hold such in reputation:">Php 2:29</a>, and the love and prayers of Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-27.htm" title="For indeed he was sick near to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow on sorrow....">Php 2:27-28</a>]: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/1-16.htm" title="The Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus; for he oft refreshed me, and was not ashamed of my chain:...">2 Timothy 1:16-17</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἤγγισε</span>, <span class="ital">drew nigh</span>) Epaphroditus, when setting out from Philippi, does not seem to have been aware that he would become sick; but yet, inasmuch as he undertook the arduous journey, not shrinking back through fear of whatever might happen to him either from the enemies of Paul or from any other cause, the sickness, although unforeseen, is attributed to him as if it were undergone out of kindness to Paul.—<span class="greekheb">παραβουλευσάμενος τῇ ψυχῇ</span>) <span class="greekheb">τῇ ψυχῇ</span>, the dative.

It is a Paronomasia [the signification of a word changed by a slight alteration of letters] on the word <span class="greekheb">παραβάλλομαι</span>, <span class="ital">I rashly dare, I cast myself recklessly into danger</span>, which the apostle seems to have skilfully avoided, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a>, at the end, note.—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑμῶν ὑστέρημα</span>, <span class="ital">your deficiency</span> [Engl.

The readings vary between "Christ" and "the Lord." One ancient manuscript reads simply, "for the work's sake." The work in this case consisted in ministering to the wants of St. Paul. Translate the following words, with R.V., <span class="accented">he came nigh unto death.</span> Not regarding his life; rather, as R.V., <span class="accented">hazarding his life</span>, which translation represents the best-supported reading, <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>: the verb literally means "to lay down a stake, to gamble." Hence the word <span class="accented">Parabolani</span>, the name given to certain brotherhoods in the ancient Church who undertook the hazardous work of tending the sick and burying the dead in times of pestilence. The A.V. represents the reading <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x1f71;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> consulting amiss. <span class="cmt_word">To supply your lack of service toward me;</span> rather, as <span class="accented">R.V., that which was lacking in your service.</span> The Philippians are not blamed. Epaphroditus did that which their absence prevented them from doing. His illness was caused by over-exertion in attending to the apostle's wants, or, it may be, by the hardships of the journey. <span class="greek">&#x3a5;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> must be taken closely with <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>, the lack of your presence.
