We observe, however, that the word “disputings” is mostly used of objections and cavils in word (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-22.htm" title="But when Jesus perceived their thoughts, he answering said to them, What reason you in your hearts?">Luke 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-8.htm" title="But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the withered hand, Rise up, and stand forth in the middle. And he arose and stood forth.">Luke 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-21.htm" title="Because that, when they knew God, they glorified him not as God, neither were thankful; but became vain in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened.">Romans 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-1.htm" title="Him that is weak in the faith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.">Romans 14:1</a>); although in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-47.htm" title="And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,">Luke 9:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-38.htm" title="And he said to them, Why are you troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?">Luke 24:38</a>, and perhaps <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1Timothy 2:8</a>, it is applied to the inner strife of the heart. In either case it seems mainly to indicate intellectual questionings. Similarly, the word “murmuring” is used of outward wranglings of discontent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-11.htm" title="And when they had received it, they murmured against the manager of the house,">Matthew 20:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/5-30.htm" title="But their scribes and Pharisees murmured against his disciples, saying, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?">Luke 5:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-41.htm" title="The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.">John 6:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-43.htm" title="Jesus therefore answered and said to them, Murmur not among yourselves.">John 6:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-61.htm" title="When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it, he said to them, Does this offend you?">John 6:61</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-12.htm" title="And there was much murmuring among the people concerning him: for some said, He is a good man: others said, No; but he deceives the people.">John 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-10.htm" title="Neither murmur you, as some of them also murmured, and were destroyed of the destroyer.">1Corinthians 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-9.htm" title="Use hospitality one to another without grudging.">1Peter 4:9</a>), proceeding not so much from the mind, as from the heart. The object, moreover, contemplated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-15.htm" title="That you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the middle of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world;">Philippians 2:15</a> is chiefly good example before men. Hence the primary reference would seem to be to their relation towards men, in spite of the close connection with the preceding verse. Nor can we forget that it is on unity among themselves that the main stress of the exhortation of this chapter turns. Of course it is obvious that the disposition rebuked is sure to show itself in both relations; and that, if checked in one, the check will react on the other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">COPIES OF JESUS</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-14.htm" title="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:...">Php 2:14-16</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We are told by some superfine modern moralists, that to regard one’s own salvation as the great work of our lives is a kind of selfishness, and no doubt there may be a colour of truth in the charge. At least the meaning of the injunction to work out our own salvation may have been sometimes so misunderstood, and there have been types of Christian character, such as the ascetic and monastic, which have made the representation plausible. I do not think that there is much danger of anybody so misunderstanding the precept now. But it is worthy of notice that there stand here side by side two paragraphs, in the former of which the effort to work out one’s own salvation is urged in the strongest terms, and in the other of which the regard for others is predominant. We shall see that the connection between these two is not accidental, but that one great reason for working out our salvation is here set forth as being the good we may thereby do to others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. We note the one great duty of cheerful yielding to God’s will.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is clear, I think, that the precept to do ‘all things without murmurings and disputings’ stands in the closest connection with what goes before. It is, in fact, the explanation of how salvation is to be wrought out. It presents the human side which corresponds to the divine activity, which has just been so earnestly insisted on. God works in us ‘willing and doing,’ let us on our parts do with ready submission all the things which He so inspires to will and to do.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘murmurings’ are not against men but against God. The ‘disputings’ are not wrangling with others but the division of mind in one’s self-questionings, hesitations, and the like. So the one are more moral, the other more intellectual, and together they represent the ways in which Christian men may resist the action on their spirits of God’s Spirit, ‘willing,’ or the action of God’s providence on their circumstances, ‘doing.’ Have we never known what it was to have some course manifestly prescribed to us as right, from which we have shrunk with reluctance of will? If some course has all at once struck us as wrong which we had been long accustomed to do without hesitation, has there been no ‘murmuring’ before we yielded? A voice has said to us, ‘Give up such and such a habit,’ or ‘such and such a pursuit is becoming too engrossing’: do we not all know what it is not only to feel obedience an effort, but even to cherish reluctance, and to let it stifle the voice?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There are often ‘disputings’ which do not get the length of ‘murmurings.’ The old word which tried to weaken the plain imperative of the first command by the subtle suggestion, ‘Yea, hath God said?’ still is whispered into our ears. We know what it is to answer God’s commands with a ‘But, Lord.’ A reluctant will is clever to drape itself with more or less honest excuses, and the only safety is in cheerful obedience and glad submission. The will of God ought not only to receive obedience, but prompt obedience, and such instantaneous and whole-souled submission is indispensable if we are to ‘work out our own salvation,’ and to present an attitude of true, receptive correspondence to that of God, who ‘works in us both to will and to do of His own good pleasure.’ Our surrender of ourselves into the hands of God, in respect both to inward and outward things, should be complete. As has been profoundly said, that surrender consists ‘in a continual forsaking and losing all self in the will of God, willing only what God from eternity has willed, forgetting what is past, giving up the time present to God, and leaving to His providence that which is to come, making ourselves content in the actual moment seeing it brings along with it the eternal order of God concerning us’ {Madame Guyon}.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The conscious aim in all our activity.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>What God works in us for is that for which we too are to yield ourselves to His working, ‘without murmurings and disputings,’ and to co-operate with glad submission and cheerful obedience. We are to have as our distinct aim the building up of a character ‘blameless and harmless, children of God without rebuke.’ The blamelessness is probably in reference to men’s judgment rather than to God’s, and the difficulty of coming untarnished from contact with the actions and criticisms of a crooked and perverse generation is emphasised by the very fact that such blamelessness is the first requirement for Christian conduct. It was a feather in Daniel’s cap that the president and princes were foiled in their attempt to pick holes in his conduct, and had to confess that they would not ‘find any occasion against him, except we find it concerning the laws of his God.’ God is working in us in order that our lives should be such that malice is dumb in their presence. Are we co-operating with Him? We are bound to satisfy the world’s requirements of Christian character. They are sharp critics and sometimes unreasonable, but on the whole it would not be a bad rule for Christian people, ‘Do what irreligious men expect you to do.’ The worst man knows more than the best man practises, and his conscience is quick to decide the course for other people. Our weaknesses and compromises, and love of the world, might receive a salutary rebuke if we would try to meet the expectations which ‘the man in the street’ forms of us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Harmless’ is more correctly pure, all of a piece, homogeneous and entire. It expresses what the Christian life should be in itself, whilst the former designation describes it more as it appears. The piece of cloth is to be so evenly and carefully woven that if held up against the light it will show no flaws nor knots. Many a professing Christian life has a veneer of godliness nailed thinly over a solid bulk of selfishness. There are many goods in the market finely dressed so as to hide that the warp is cotton and only the weft silk. No Christian man who has memory and self-knowledge can for a moment claim to have reached the height of his ideal; the best of us, at the best, are like Nebuchadnezzar’s image, whose feet were iron and clay, but we ought to strain after it and to remember that a stain shows most on the whitest robe. What made David’s sin glaring and memorable was its contradiction of his habitual nobler self. One spot more matters little on a robe already covered with many. The world is fully warranted in pointing gleefully or contemptuously at Christians’ inconsistencies, and we have no right to find fault with their most pointed sarcasms, or their severest judgments. It is those ‘that bear the vessels of the Lord’ whose burden imposes on them the duty ‘be ye clean,’ and makes any uncleanness more foul in them than in any other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle sets forth the place and function of Christians in the world, by bringing together in the sharpest contrast the ‘children of God’ and a ‘crooked and perverse generation.’ He is thinking of the old description in Deuteronomy, where the ancient Israel is charged with forgetting ‘Thy Father that hath bought thee,’ and as showing by their corruption that they are a ‘perverse and crooked generation.’ The ancient Israel had been the Son of God, and yet had corrupted itself; the Christian Israel are ‘sons of God’ set among a world all deformed, twisted, perverted. ‘Perverse’ is a stronger word than ‘crooked,’ which latter may be a metaphor for moral obliquity, like our own right and wrong, or perhaps points to personal deformity. Be that as it may, the position which the Apostle takes is plain enough. He regards the two classes as broadly separated in antagonism in the very roots of their being. Because the ‘sons of God’ are set in the midst of that ‘crooked and perverse generation’ constant watchfulness is needed lest they should conform, constant resort to their Father lest they should lose the sense of sonship, and constant effort that they may witness of Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The solemn reason for this aim.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That is drawn from a consideration of the office and function of Christian men. Their position in the midst of a ‘crooked and perverse generation’ devolves on them a duty in relation to that generation. They are to ‘appear as lights in the world.’ The relation between them and it is not merely one of contrast, but on their parts one of witness and example. The metaphor of light needs no explanation. We need only note that the word, ‘are seen’ or ‘appear,’ is indicative, a statement of fact, not imperative, a command. As the stars lighten the darkness with their myriad lucid points, so in the divine ideal Christian men are to be as twinkling lights in the abyss of darkness. Their light rays forth without effort, being an involuntary efflux. Possibly the old paradox of the Psalmist was in the Apostle’s mind, which speaks of the eloquent silence, in which ‘there is no speech nor language, and their voice is not heard,’ but yet ‘their line has gone out through all the earth, and their words unto the end of the world.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christian men appear as lights by ‘holding forth the word of life.’ In themselves they have no brightness but that which comes from raying out the light that is in them. The word of life must live, giving life in us, if we are ever to be seen as ‘lights in the world.’ As surely as the electric light dies out of a lamp when the current is switched off, so surely shall we be light only when we are ‘in the Lord.’ There are many so-called Christians in this day who stand tragically unaware that their ‘lamps are gone out.’ When the sun rises and smites the mountain tops they burn, when its light falls on Memnon’s stony lips they breathe out music, ‘Arise, shine, for thy light has come.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Undoubtedly one way of ‘holding forth the word of life’ must be to speak the word, but silent living ‘blameless and harmless’ and leaving the secret of the life very much to tell itself is perhaps the best way for most Christian people to bear witness. Such a witness is constant, diffused wherever the witness-bearer is seen, and free from the difficulties that beset speech, and especially from the assumption of superiority which often gives offence. It was the sight of ‘your good deeds’ to which Jesus pointed as the strongest reason for men’s ‘glorifying your Father.’ If we lived such lives there would be less need for preachers. ‘If any will not hear the word they may without the word be won.’ And reasonably so, for Christianity is a life and cannot be all told in words, and the Gospel is the proclamation of freedom from sin, and is best preached and proved by showing that we are free. The Gospel was lived as well as spoken. Christ’s life was Christ’s mightiest preaching.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘<span class="ital">The word was flesh and wrought With human hands the creed of creeds.</span>’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we keep near to Him we too shall witness, and if our faces shine like Moses’ as he came down from the mountain, or like Stephen’s in the council chamber, men will ‘take knowledge of us that we have been with Jesus.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-14.htm" title="Do all things without murmurings and disputings:...">Php 2:14-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Do all things </span>— Especially all good offices to each other, not only without contention, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Php 2:3</a>,) but even <span class="ital">without murmurings </span>— At your duty, or at one another; <span class="ital">and disputings </span>— With each other, or altercations, which are real, though smaller, hinderances of love.

With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Do all things without murmurings and disputings - In a quiet, peaceful, inoffensive manner.
