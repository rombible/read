It is, <span class= "ital">If I am being poured out</span>—if my life-blood is poured out—<span class= "ital">over the sacrifice and religious ministration of your faith.</span> The same word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2Timothy 4:6</a>, where our version has, “I am now ready to be offered.” The allusion is to the practice of pouring out libations or drink-offerings (usually of wine) over sacrifices, both Jewish and heathen. Such libation was held to be a subsidiary or preparatory element of the sacrifice. In that light St. Paul regards his own possible martyrdom, not so much as having a purpose and value in itself, but rather as conducing to the self-sacrifice of the Philippians by faith—a sacrifice apparently contemplated as likely to be offered in life rather than by death.<p><span class= "bld">The sacrifice and service of your faith.</span>—The word here rendered “service,” with its kindred words, properly means any service rendered by an individual for the community; and it retains something of this meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/9-12.htm" title="For the administration of this service not only supplies the want of the saints, but is abundant also by many thanksgivings to God;">2Corinthians 9:12</a>, where it is applied to the collection and transmission of alms to Jerusalem (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-27.htm" title="It has pleased them truly; and their debtors they are.

The simplest interpretation of the whole passage would be to consider the Philippians merely as priests, and to suppose “sacrifice” to describe the chief function, and “ministration” the general function, of their priesthood. But the word “sacrifice,” though it might etymologically mean the act of sacrifice, has universally in the New Testament the sense, not of the act, but of the thing sacrificed. Accordingly, here it would seem that, following afar off the example of the great high priest, the Christian is described as at once sacrifice and priest, “offering” (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>) “his own body as a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God,” and with it the “sacrifice of praise” and the “sacrifice of doing good and communicating” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/13-15.htm" title="By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name.">Hebrews 13:15-16</a>, and below, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-18.htm" title="But I have all, and abound: I am full, having received of Epaphroditus the things which were sent from you, an odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.">Philippians 4:18</a>). This union of sacrifice and ministration, being the work “of faith,” is in St. Paul’s view the thing really precious; his own death the mere preparation for it, in which he rejoices “to spend and be spent” for them.<p><span class= "bld">I joy, and rejoice with you all.</span>—That is, <span class= "ital">I joy, and that in sympathy with you.</span> First, “I joy” absolutely, in the feeling that “to depart and be with Christ,” following Him in His own way of suffering, is far better. Next, “I joy in sympathy with you,” in the sense of community of sacrifice, and brotherhood in suffering, for the sake of the one Lord. The emphasis laid on the latter clause harmonises with the old proverb, that sorrow is halved, and joy doubled, when it is shared with others.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all....">Php 2:17-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Yea, and if I be offered up </span>— Or, <span class="ital">poured out, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σπενδομαι </span>properly signifies; <span class="ital">upon the sacrifice and service of your faith</span> — Greek, <span class="greekheb">θυσια και λειτουργια</span>; the former word properly signifies a <span class="ital">sacrifice, </span>and the latter <span class="ital">the performance of any public service, </span>especially that pertaining to the worship of God. The apostle alludes to the Jewish sacrifices, which were prepared for the altar on which they were to be offered, by the Levites and priests, and on which, or on the meat-offerings that accompanied them, were poured oil and wine, which was the <span class="greekheb">σπονδη</span>, or libation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/29-40.htm" title="And with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil; and the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering....">Exodus 29:40-41</a>. Thus the apostle, representing himself as a priest, and the Philippian believers, and other converted heathen, as sacrifices prepared and offered for God’s acceptance through his ministry, speaks of his blood as a libation, which, costly as it was, he was willing to pour out on these sacrifices, if this might tend, in any degree, to confirm the faith of these Gentiles, establish them in the truth, and thereby render the oblation of them more acceptable to God. <span class="ital">I joy and rejoice with you all</span> — Or, <span class="ital">I rejoice and congratulate you all; </span>that is, if while I am thus, <span class="greekheb">λειτουργων</span>, <span class="ital">ministering as a priest, </span>or employed in preparing and offering this living sacrifice, my blood should be the libation poured out upon it, I should rejoice even thus to die in your service, and for the confirmation of your faith.

With great care, lest, with all our advantages, we should come short. Work out your salvation, for it is God who worketh in you. This encourages us to do our utmost, because our labour shall not be in vain: we must still depend on the grace of God. The working of God's grace in us, is to quicken and engage our endeavours. God's good-will to us, is the cause of his good work in us. Do your duty without murmurings. Do it, and do not find fault with it. Mind your work, and do not quarrel with it. By peaceableness; give no just occasion of offence. The children of God should differ from the sons of men. The more perverse others are, the more careful we should be to keep ourselves blameless and harmless. The doctrine and example of consistent believers will enlighten others, and direct their way to Christ and holiness, even as the light-house warns mariners to avoid rocks, and directs their course into the harbour. Let us try thus to shine. The gospel is the word of life, it makes known to us eternal life through Jesus Christ. Running, denotes earnestness and vigour, continual pressing forward; labouring, denotes constancy, and close application. It is the will of God that believers should be much in rejoicing; and those who are so happy as to have good ministers, have great reason to rejoice with them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, and if I be offered - Margin, "poured forth." The mention of his labors in their behalf, in the previous verse, seems to have suggested to him the sufferings which he was likely yet to endure on their account. He had labored for their salvation. He had exposed himself to peril that they and others might have the gospel. On their account he had suffered much; he had been made a prisoner at Rome; and there was a possibility, if not a probability, that his life might be a forfeit for his labors in their behalf. Yet he says that, even if this should happen, he would not regret it, but it would be a source of joy. The word which is used here - &#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  spendomai - properly means, to pour out, to make a libation; and is commonly used, in the classic writers, in connection with sacrifices. It refers to a drink-offering, where one who was about to offer a sacrifice, or to present a drink-offering to the gods, before he tasted of it himself, poured out apart of it on the altar. Passow. It is used also to denote the fact that, when an animal was about to be slain in sacrifice, wine was poured on it as a solemn act of devoting it to God; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-7.htm">Numbers 28:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-14.htm">Numbers 28:14</a>. In like manner, Paul may have regarded himself as a victim prepared for the sacrifice. In the New Testament it is found only in this place, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, where it is rendered, "I am ready to be offered;" compare the notes at that place. It does not here mean that Paul really expected to be a sacrifice, or to make an expiation for sin by his death; but that he might be called to pour out his blood, or to offer up his life as if he were a sacrifice, or an offering to God. We have a similar use of language, when we say that a man sacrifices himself for his friends or his country.<p>Upon the sacrifice - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834; &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;  epi te&#772; thusia. The word rendered here as "sacrifice," means:<p>(1) the act of sacrificing;<p>(2) the victim that is offered; and,<p>(3) any oblation or offering.<p>Robinson's Lexicon. Here it must be used in the latter sense, and is connected with "faith" - "the sacrifice of your faith." The reference is probably to the faith, i. e., the religion of the Philippians, regarded as a sacrifice or an offering to God; the worship which they rendered to Him. The idea of Paul is, that if, in order to render that offering what it should be - to make it as complete and acceptable to God as possible - it were necessary for him to die, pouring out his blood, and strength, and life, as wine was poured out to prepare a sacrifice for the altar and make it complete, he would not refuse to do it, but would rejoice in the opportunity. He seems to have regarded them as engaged in making an offering of faith, and as endeavoring to make the offering complete and acceptable; and says that if his death were necessary to make their piety of the highest and most acceptable kind, he was ready to die.<p>And service - &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  leitourgia - a word taken from an act of worship, or public service, and especially the ministry of those engaged in offering sacrifices; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-23.htm">Luke 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>. Here it means, the ministering or service which the Philippians rendered to God; the worship which they offered, the essential element of which was faith. Paul was willing to endure anything, even to suffer death in their cause, if it would tend to make their "service" more pure, spiritual, and acceptable to God. The meaning of the whole is:<p>(1) that the sufferings and dangers which he now experienced were in their cause, and on their behalf; and,<p>(2) that he was willing to lay down his life, if their piety would be promoted, and their worship be rendered more pure and acceptable to God.<p>I joy - That is, I am not afraid of death; and if my dying can be the means of promoting your piety, it will be a source of rejoicing; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-23.htm">Philippians 1:23</a>.<p>And rejoice with you all - My joy will be increased in anything that promotes yours.

Yea, and if&#8212;rather as Greek, "Yea, if even"; implying that he regarded the contingency as not unlikely: He had assumed the possibility of his being found alive at Christ's coming (for in every age Christ designed Christians to stand in preparedness for His coming as at hand): he here puts a supposition which he regards as more likely, namely, his own death before Christ's coming.<p>I be offered&#8212;rather as Greek, "I am poured out."

T., is <span class="ital">sacrifice</span>, so that the idea is: at the sacrifice and priestly service of your faith; hence there is no necessity for taking it as <span class="ital">sacrificing</span>, or the <span class="ital">Acts of sacrifice</span> (Herod. iv. 60, viii. 99; Herodian, viii. 3. 5, i. 36. 12, <span class="ital">al</span>.). The <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, however, is simply to be taken as <span class="ital">at</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a> and frequently; not as <span class="ital">to, in addition to</span> (Beza, Raphel, Matthies, de Wette, Weiss, and many others; comp. also Hofmann), or with the Vulgate as <span class="ital">supra</span> (Heinrichs, Hoelemann, van Hengel), in the sense of the (heathen) <span class="ital">mode</span>[133] of the libation, an interpretation which should have been precluded by the addition of the abstract <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λειτουργ</span>. Finally, although Paul’s official activity concerned the faith of all his churches, he says <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> with the same right of <span class="ital">individualizing</span> reference as in <span class="greekheb">δἰ ὑμᾶς</span> at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-24.htm" title="Nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more needful for you.">Php 1:24</a> and many other passages. The passage is peculiarly misunderstood by Hofmann, who holds that <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> has the sense <span class="ital">in association with;</span> that <span class="greekheb">τῆς πίστεως ὑμ</span>. is the genitive of <span class="ital">apposition</span> to <span class="greekheb">θυσίᾳ</span> and <span class="greekheb">λειτουργ</span>.; that the sacrificing and ministering <span class="ital">subject</span> is not the apostle, but the Philippian <span class="ital">church</span>, which, when it became <span class="ital">believing</span>, had presented its own <span class="ital">sacrifice</span> to God, and has been <span class="ital">constantly honouring</span> Him with its own <span class="ital">work of service</span>. Accordingly Paul says that, even though his labours should end in a violent death, yet <span class="ital">the shedding of his blood would not be an isolated drink-offering, but would associate itself with their sacrifice</span>. But this would only make him say, with artificial mysteriousness, something which is perfectly self-evident (namely: after that ye became believers, and whilst ye are believers). Moreover, <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> would thus be made to express two very different relations, namely, with <span class="greekheb">τῇ θυσίᾳ</span> <span class="ital">after, after that</span>, and with the <span class="greekheb">λειτουργίᾳ</span> <span class="ital">at, during</span>. And how could a reader discover from the mere <span class="greekheb">ἐπί κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the alleged antithetical reference of an <span class="ital">isolated</span> drink-offering, especially as no <span class="ital">antithesis of the persons</span> is even indicated by <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span> being placed first (immediately after <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>)? The entire explanation is a forced artificial expedient in consequence of the mistaken assumption that an apodosis begins after <span class="greekheb">σπένδομαι</span>, and a new section sets in with <span class="greekheb">χαίρω</span>.[134]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΊΡΩ</span></span></span>] Apodosis down to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῖΝ</span></span></span>: <span class="ital">I rejoice</span>, not at the <span class="greekheb">θυσία κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λειτουργία τῆς πίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὑμ</span> (Chrysostom, who connects <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠῚ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ΘΥΣ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">Λ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΊΡΩ</span></span></span>; comp.

The explanation of it as referring generally to <span class="ital">inward joyfulness of faith</span> (Wiesinger) or <span class="ital">divine serenity</span> (Ewald), does not correspond with the protasis, according to which it must be joyfulness in the prospect of <span class="ital">death</span>. “Even if I am compelled <span class="ital">to die</span> in this sacrificial service, I <span class="ital">rejoice</span> therein,” and that, indeed, <span class="ital">now</span> for the case supposed; hence not <span class="ital">future</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ συγχ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πᾶσιν ὑμῖν</span>] is wrongly explained by most commentators: “<span class="ital">and I rejoice with you all</span>” (so Chrysostom, Theophylact, Luther, Calvin, Heinrichs, Matthies, van Hengel, Rilliet, de Wette, Wiesinger, Ewald, Schneckenburger, Weiss, Hofmann, and many others); along with which explanation Chrysostom, Theophylact, and various of the older expositors, bring forward <span class="ital">another</span> ground for this <span class="ital">joint joy</span> than for the <span class="greekheb">χαίρω</span> (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΊΡΩ ΜῈΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΤΙ ΣΠΟΝΔΉ ΓΊΝΟΜΑΙ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ΣΥΓΧΑΊΡΩ ΔῈ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΤΙ ΘΥΣΊΑΝ ΠΡΟΣΕΝΕΓΚΏΝ</span></span></span>; comp. Schneckenburger). Decisive against this interpretation is the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΧΑΊΡΕΤΕ</span></span></span> which follows in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-18.htm" title="For the same cause also do you joy, and rejoice with me.">Php 2:18</a>,—a summons which would be absurd, if <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΝΓΧ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὙΜ</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span> meant: “I <span class="ital">rejoice with you.</span>” The Vulgate already rightly renders: <span class="ital">congratulor</span> (comp.

Such</span> a martyrdom, namely, <span class="ital">for the sake of their faith</span>, how it must have <span class="ital">elevated and honoured</span> the readers, their whole church; for such a martyr death concerned them all! Comp. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a>; it redounds to their <span class="ital">glory</span>, if the apostle sheds his blood on account of their Christian standing established by him. It is <span class="ital">in this light</span> that Paul wishes his <span class="greekheb">σπένδεσθαι</span>, should it occur, to be regarded by his readers, and therefore gracefully and ingeniously represents it (though Hofmann holds this to be impossible) as something on which he must <span class="ital">congratulate</span> them all. Pauline linguistic usage is not to be urged in objection to this view (Weiss), as Paul employs <span class="greekheb">συγχαίρω</span> elsewhere only in the passages <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-26.htm" title="And whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.">1 Corinthians 12:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-6.htm" title="Rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in the truth;">1 Corinthians 13:6</a>, and these are balanced by <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all....">Php 2:17-18</a> here.

The imagery is sacrificial. He views the Philippians as an altar-sacrifice, a burnt-offering, in their character of consecrated believers; and upon that sacrifice the drink-offering, the libation, the outpoured wine, is Paul’s life-blood, Paul as their missionary martyr. On the libations of the Mosaic ritual, cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/15-3.htm" title="And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet smell to the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:...">Numbers 15:3-10</a>, where the drink-offering appears as a conspicuous detail in the rite of the burnt-offering. Bp Lightfoot thinks that a reference to the pagan ritual of libation is more likely, in an Epistle to a Church of Gentile converts. But surely St Paul familiarized all his converts with O.T. symbolism; and his <span class="ital">own mind</span> was of course deeply impregnated with it.——The same word, but without any detail of imagery, appears again <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm" title="For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, on the then actual eve of St Paul’s death by the sword.—“The present tense [<span class="ital">‘am being shed’</span>] places the hypothesis vividly before the eyes: but it does not … refer to present dangers … comp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-26.htm" title="And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself; how shall then his kingdom stand?">Matthew 12:26</a>” (Lightfoot).—Ignatius (<span class="ital">To the Romans</span>, c. 2) speaks of being <span class="ital">“libated to God”;</span> probably an allusion to this phrase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the sacrifice and service of your faith</span>] As we have just explained, their faith in Jesus Christ, resulting in their living self-sacrifice to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm" title="I beseech you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.">Romans 12:1</a>), constituted them as it were victims at a spiritual altar, and their lives a sacerdotal ritual or “service.” Cp. for an instructive parallel <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm" title="That I should be the minister of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.">Romans 15:16</a>, with note in this Series.—These are the only two passages in his whole writings where the Apostle applies the language of sacerdotalism to the work of the Christian ministry. (See Appendix C.) It is remarkable that in each place the language is obviously that of figure and, so to speak, poetry. In the Ep. to the Romans, “the Gentiles” are “the oblation,” and “the glad-tidings” is the matter on which his “priest-work” is exercised. In this passage the Philippians are both “sacrifice” and “altar-ministers,” while Paul is the “libation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I joy, and rejoice with you all</span>] Again the warm and significant words, “<span class="ital">you all</span>.”—His willing death for Christ, viewed as a last contribution to their spiritual good, a last aid in their life of believing self-consecration, would be a personal joy to him, and an occasion of united joy with them or (as Lightfoot explains the phrase here) congratulation of them. The Apostle assumes that <span class="ital">they</span> would rejoice, with the deep joy of men who shared the martyr spirit. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-13.htm" title="Why I desire that you faint not at my tribulations for you, which is your glory.">Ephesians 3:13</a> for a somewhat similar thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Polycarp’s Epistle (see our Introduction, ch. 5) almost begins with a phrase which is a reminiscence of this sentence and <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-17.htm" title="Yes, and if I be offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all.">Php 2:17</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλλʼ εἰ καὶ</span>, <span class="ital">but if even</span>) Look back at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-22.htm" title="But if I live in the flesh, this is the fruit of my labor: yet what I shall choose I know not.">Php 1:22</a>, note.—<span class="greekheb">εἰ καὶ σπένδομαι ἐπὶ τῇ θυσίᾳ καὶ λειτουργίᾳ</span>, Engl. Vers. <span class="ital">if I am even offered upon the sacrifice and service;</span> Bengel gives, <span class="ital">if I am poured out on the victim and sacrifice</span>) The Philippians, as well as the other nations converted to the faith, were the <span class="ital">oblation;</span> Paul was the <span class="ital">minister</span> [not here primarily, <span class="ital">the offering</span>, or <span class="ital">oblation</span>, as Engl.

The future accomplishment of the sacrifice was matter of joy to both. Here is the superior excellence of martyrdom. The phrase is in consonance with the punishment of the sword, which awaited Paul.—<span class="greekheb">θυσίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">the victim, the sacrifice</span>) To this refer, <span class="ital">I rejoice with you, rejoice ye</span>.—<span class="greekheb">λειτουργίᾳ</span>, <span class="ital">service</span>) To this refer, <span class="ital">I rejoice</span>, and <span class="ital">rejoice ye with me</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 17.</span> <span class="cmt_word">- Yea, and if I be offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith</span>. He again compares the advantages of life and death, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-20.htm">Philippians 1:20-25</a>. In the last verse he was speaking of the possibility of looking back from the day of Christ upon a life of prolonged labor. Here he supposes the other alternative. The form of the sentence, the particles used (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>), and the indicative verb, all imply that the apostle looked forward to a martyr's death as the probable end of his life of warfare: Yea. he if I am even offered, as seems likely, and as I expect. <span class="accented">Offered</span>; the word means "poured out" as a libation or drink offering. St. Paul regards his blood shed in martyrdom as a libation poured forth in willing sacrifice. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f18;&#x3b3;&#x1f7c;&#x20;&#x3b3;&#x1f70;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;</span>, "I am already being poured forth: the libation is commencing, the time of my departure is at hand." Compare also the similar words of Ignatius, 'Rom.' 2, and the words of the dying Seneca (Tacitus, 'Annals,' 15:64). Some think that the apostle, writing, as he does, to converted heathen, draws his metaphor from heathen sacrifices: in those sacrifices the libation was a much more important element than the drink offering in the Mosaic rites; and it was poured <span class="accented">upon</span> the sacrifice, whereas the drink offering seems to have been poured around the altar, not upon it. On the other hand, the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;</span> is constantly used of the Jewish drink offering, and does not necessarily mean upon, but only "in addition to," or "at;" the drink offering being an accompaniment to the sacrifice. <span class="accented">Service</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>). This important word denotes in classical Greek <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> certain costly public offices at Athens, discharged by the richer citizens in rotation; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> any service or function  In the Greek Scriptures it is used of priestly ministrations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-6.htm">Hebrews 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-21.htm">Hebrews 9:21</a>; comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>). In ecclesiastical Greek it stands for the order of the Holy Communion, the ancient liturgies; it is sometimes used loosely for any set form of public prayer. The analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-1.htm">Romans 12:1</a>, Where St. Paul exhorts Christians to present their bodies a living sacrifice, suggests that here the Philippians are regarded as priests (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>), offering the sacrifice of their faith, their hearts, themselves, in the ministrations of the spiritual priesthood; St. Paul's blood being represented as the accompanying drink offering. Others, comparing <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-16.htm">Romans 15:16</a>, where also sacrificial words are used, regard St. Paul himself as the ministering priest, and understand the metaphor of a priest slain at the altar, his blood being shed while he is offering the sacrifice of their faith. <span class="cmt_word">I joy, and rejoice with you all</span>. Meyer, Bengel, and others prefer "congratulate" as the rendering of <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x1f77;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;</span> "I rejoice with you." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I am offered (&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., I am poured out as a libation. The figure is that of a sacrifice, in which the Philippians are the priests, offering their faith to God, and Paul's life is the libation poured out at this offering. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-15.htm">2 Corinthians 12:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-6.htm">2 Timothy 4:6</a>. Ignatius: "Brethren, I am lavishly poured out in love for you" (Philadelphia, 5).<p>Upon the sacrifice, etc. (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>The image is probably drawn from heathen rather than from Jewish sacrifices, since Paul was writing to converted heathen. According to Josephus, the Jewish libation was poured round and not upon the altar; but the preposition &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769; used here, was also used to describe it. At all events, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769; may be rendered at, which would suit either.<p>Sacrifice and service (&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#837;)<p>Sacrifice, as uniformly in the New Testament, the thing sacrificed.
