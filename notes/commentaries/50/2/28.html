Epaphroditus’ recovery and safe return would take away the “sorrow upon sorrow;” but the old sorrow of captivity, enforced inactivity, and anxiety for the condition of the gospel, would remain. The expression of perfect joy belongs to the “spirit which was willing” indeed; the hint of an unspoken sorrow marks the weakness of the flesh.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-28.htm" title="I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful....">Php 2:28-30</a></span>. <span class="ital">I sent him therefore the more carefully </span>— Or, <span class="ital">speedily, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σπουδαιοτερως </span>here signifies; <span class="ital">that seeing him again </span>— In a state of health, <span class="ital">ye may rejoice </span>— May be comforted after your trouble; <span class="ital">and that I may be the less sorrowful </span>— When I know you are rejoicing. <span class="ital">Receive him therefore </span>— With affection and gratitude, being assured that his long absence was owing, not to want of love to you, but to bad health; <span class="ital">and hold </span>persons of <span class="ital">such </span>a character, whatever their station of life may be, in great estimation. <span class="ital">Because for the work of Christ he was nigh unto death </span>— It appears from the last clause of this verse, that by the work of Christ here, the apostle partly meant his personal attendance on the apostle in his bonds, and the various services he performed for him, with his sundry journeys by land and sea on his account: but it is probable that he included also his labours in preaching the gospel in Rome, and in the neighbouring cities and villages, with his carrying the apostle’s messages and instructions to the disciples, his watching over them, visiting such of them as were sick, and other similar offices. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:19-30 It is best with us, when our duty becomes natural to us. Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I send him therefore the more carefully - With more diligence, or speed; I was the more ready to send him.<p>That I may be the less sorrowful - That is, on account of my solicitude for you; that I may know that your minds are at ease, and that you rejoice in his being among you. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>27.

Or in greater haste, and as soon as possible: <p>that when ye see him again ye may rejoice; for this must greatly increase their joy, to see him again after he had been so long from them, and under such a disorder, which had made them to fear they should never see him more. The Syriac version renders it, "that when ye see him ye may rejoice again"; as they had done heretofore in his conversation and ministry, when among them: <p>and that I may be the less sorrowful; when he should hear of his safe arrival among them, and of their joyful reception of him to their mutual satisfaction, which would be an alleviation of the apostle's sorrow in his present circumstances; for he did not expect to be wholly without sorrow while in this life. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm" title="I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.">Php 2:28</a>. <span class="ital">The more urgently, therefore</span> (in consequence of this sickness which he had had and recovered from, of which ye received tidings, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-26.htm" title="For he longed after you all, and was full of heaviness, because that you had heard that he had been sick....">Php 2:26-27</a>), I have brought about his return, which otherwise I would still have delayed.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πάλιν</span>] belongs to <span class="greekheb">χαρῆτε</span>, as Paul usually places it <span class="ital">before</span> the verb, or, at least, makes it follow <span class="ital">immediately</span> after. See Gersdorf, <span class="ital">Beitr</span>. p. 491 f., and van Hengel. And the context affords no ground for departing from the usual mode, and for joining it with <span class="greekheb">ἰδόντες αὐτόν</span> (Beza, Grotius, and others, also Baumgarten-Crusius and de Wette).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ ἀλυπότ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ὦ</span>] <span class="greekheb">Ἐὰν γὰρ ὑμεῖς χαρῆτε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐγὼ χαίρω</span>, Oecumenius. He is not <span class="greekheb">ἄλυπος</span>, for he is in captivity and surrounded by adversaries; but the joy which he is aware is already prepared for his beloved Philippians by the return of Epaphroditus, <span class="ital">lessens</span> his <span class="greekheb">λύπη</span>. This tender interweaving of his own alleviation with the rejoicing of his readers is lost, if we refer <span class="greekheb">ἀλύποτ</span>. to the removal of <span class="ital">the</span> vexation <span class="ital">of seeing the recovered one so full of longing and so uneasy</span> (Hofmann), which, regarded as <span class="greekheb">λύπη</span>, would be sentimental. According to Weiss, Paul intends to say: <span class="ital">still more</span> <span class="greekheb">ἄλυπος</span>, than I have already become in consequence of Epaphroditus’ recovery. An unsuitable idea, because the comparative necessarily presupposes a certain degree of the <span class="greekheb">λύπη</span> still remaining. In the consciousness of this Paul has written <span class="greekheb">ἀλυπότ</span>.; if it had been otherwise, he would perhaps have used, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.">Php 2:19</a>, <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ εὐψυχῶ</span> or <span class="greekheb">κἀγὼ χαίρω</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philippians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm" title="I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.">Php 2:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">σπουδ</span>. The more regular form is the inferior reading <span class="greekheb">σπουδαιότερον</span>, which is due to some copyist. But that in -<span class="greekheb">ως</span> is also found in classical Greek. See W-Sch[11]., p. 98. It is quite possible that we have here, as frequently in later popular Greek, a comparative with superlative force (see Blass, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, p. 33). “I sent him with all haste” (including the notion of anxiety and concern which belongs to <span class="greekheb">σπουδαῖος</span>).—<span class="greekheb">ἔπεμ</span>. Epistolary aorist.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλυπότ</span>. Their joy means the lifting of a burden from his heart. He sympathised with Epaphroditus’ yearning for home. He sympathised with the Philippians’ anxiety for their brother. Chr[12]. aptly quotes Paul’s own words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-29.htm" title="Who is weak, and I am not weak? who is offended, and I burn not?">2 Corinthians 11:29</a>, <span class="greekheb">τίς ἀσθενεῖ καὶ οὐκ ἀσθενῶ</span>; <span class="greekheb">τίς σκανδαλίζεται καὶ οὐκ ἐγὼ πυροῦμαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11] Sch.

Among his sorrows, he intimates, was his being the unwilling cause of separating Epaphroditus from the Philippians, and bringing him into risks at Rome. To think of him as safely returned to Philippi would be a solace, though it would be a new separation for himself.—Under the shadow of that last thought, perhaps, he says not “<span class="ital">happier</span>” but “<span class="ital">less sorrowful</span>.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/philippians/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-28.htm" title="I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when you see him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.">Php 2:28</a>. <span class="greekheb">Σπουδαιοτέρως</span>, <span class="ital">the more earnestly, anxiously</span> [<span class="ital">carefully</span>]) sooner than Timothy, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-19.htm" title="But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timotheus shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.">Php 2:19</a>.—<span class="greekheb">χαρῆτε</span>, <span class="ital">ye may rejoice</span>) Godly men may receive joy from all things.—<span class="greekheb">ἀλυπότερος ὦ</span>, <span class="ital">I may be the less sorrowful</span>) when I know, that you rejoice.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/philippians/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 28.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I sent him therefore the more carefully, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful;</span> rather, <span class="accented">I send him</span> (epistolary aorist, as Ver. 25), <span class="accented">I send him with the letter.</span> Perhaps "again" is better taken with the following clause; "that when ye see him, ye may again rejoice." Note St. Paul's ready sympathy with the Philippians: their restored joy will involve a diminution of his sorrow. Mark also the implied admission that sorrows must still remain, though spiritual joy brightens and relieves them.
