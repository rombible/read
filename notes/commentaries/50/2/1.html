(1) “Consolation” is properly <span class= "ital">encouragement</span>—the stirring up of spiritual activity—ascribed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-31.htm" title="Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Ghost, were multiplied.">Acts 9:31</a> to the action of the Holy Spirit, but here viewed as a practical manifestation of the life flowing from union with Christ. Out of it comes naturally the “comfort of love,” that is, as always, the deep and thankful sense of comfort in His love, overflowing into comfort, lovingly given to our brethren. On this “encouragement” in Christ, both received and given out to others, St. Paul dwells at length (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/1-3.htm" title="Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort;">2Corinthians 1:3-7</a>). (2) Next, he speaks of “communion of the Spirit” (the very word used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/13-13.htm" title="All the saints salute you.">2Corinthians 13:13</a>), by which, indeed, we are brought into that unity with Christ; and of this, still keeping to the main idea of love, he makes the manifestation to be in “bowels and mercies”—that is, both in strong affection, and in that peculiar form of affection which is directed towards suffering, viz., compassion or pity. The whole passage (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/4-8.htm" title="Finally, brothers, whatever things are true, whatever things are honest, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.">Philippians 4:8-9</a>) is full of a grave and persuasive eloquence characteristic of this Epistle. No absolute distinction is to be drawn between the two elements of the sentence; but it may be noted that the “consolation in Christ” is exhibited in the action which visibly follows His divine example, “the communion with the Holy Spirit” is shown by the inner emotion, not seen, but felt.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/2.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A PLEA FOR UNITY</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,...">Php 2:1-4</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There was much in the state of the Philippian church which filled Paul’s heart with thankfulness, and nothing which drew forth his censures, but these verses, with their extraordinary energy of pleading, seem to hint that there was some defect in the unity of heart and mind of members of the community. It did not amount to discord, but the concord was not as full as it might have been. There is another hint pointing in the same direction in the appeal to Paul’s true yoke-fellow, in chapter 4:, to help two good women who, though they had laboured much in the gospel, had not managed to keep ‘of the same mind in the Lord,’ and there is perhaps a still further indication that Paul’s sensitive heart was conscious of the beginnings of strife in the air, in the remarkable emphasis with which, at the very outset of the letter, he over and over again pours out his confidence and affection on them ‘all,’ as if aware of some incipient rifts in their brotherhood. There are always forces at work which tend to part the most closely knit unities even when these are consecrated by Christian faith. Where there are no dogmatical grounds of discord, nor any open alienation, there may still be the beginnings of separation, and a chill breeze may be felt even when the sun is shining with summer warmth. Wasps are attracted by the ripest fruit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words of our text present no special difficulty, and bring before us a well-worn subject, but it has at least this element of interest, that it grips very tightly the deepest things in Christian life, and that none of us can truly say that we do not need to listen to Paul’s pleading voice. We may notice the general division of his thoughts in these words, in that he puts first the heart-touching motives for listening to his appeal, next describes with the exuberance of earnestness the fair ideal of unity to which he exhorts, and finally touches on the hindrances to its realisation, and the victorious powers which will overcome these.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. The motives and bonds of Christian unity.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not a pedantic dissection {and vivisection} of the Apostle’s earnest words, if we point out that they fall into four clauses, of which the first and third {‘any comfort in Christ, any fellowship of the Spirit’} urge the objective facts of Christian revelation, and the second and fourth {‘any consolation of love, any tender mercies and compassions’} put emphasis on the subjective emotions of Christian experience. We may lay the warmth of all of these on our own hearts, and shall find that these hearts will be drawn into the blessedness of Christian unity in the precise measure in which they are affected by them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the first of them, it may be suggested that here, as elsewhere in the New Testament, the true idea of the word rendered ‘comfort’ is rather ‘exhortation.’ The Apostle is probably not so much pointing to the consolations for trouble which come from Jesus, as to the stimulus to unity which flows from Him. It would rather weaken the force of Paul’s appeal, if the two former grounds of it were so nearly identical as they are, if the one is based upon ‘comfort’ and the other on ‘consolation.’ The Apostle is true to his dominant belief, that in Jesus Christ there lies, and from Him flows, the sovereign exhortation that rouses men to ‘whatsoever things are lovely and of good report.’ In Him we shall find in the measure in which we are in Him, the most persuasive of all exhortations to unity, and the most omnipotent of all powers to enforce it. Shall we not be glad to be in the flock of the Good Shepherd, and to preserve the oneness which He gave His life to establish? Can we live in Him, and not share His love for His sheep? Surely those who have felt the benediction of His breath on their foreheads when He prayed ‘that they may all be one; even as Thou, Father, art in Me and I in Thee,’ cannot but do what is in them to fulfil that prayer, and to bring a little nearer the realisation of their Lord’s purpose in it, ‘that the world may believe that Thou didst send Me.’ Surely if we lay to heart, and enter into sympathy with, the whole life and death of Jesus Christ, we shall not fail to feel the dynamic power fusing us together, nor fail to catch the exhortation to unity which comes from the lips that said, ‘I am the vine, ye are the branches.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle next bases his appeal for unity on the experiences of the Philippian Christians, and on their memories of the comfort which they have tasted in the exercise of mutual love. Our hearts find it hard to answer the question whether they are more blessed when their love passes out from them in a warm stream to others, or when the love of others pours into them. To love and to be loved equally elevate courage, and brace the weakest for calm endurance and high deeds. The man who loves and knows that he is loved will be a hero. It must always seem strange and inexplicable that a heart which has known the enlargement and joy of love given and received, should ever fall so far beneath itself as to be narrowed and troubled by nourishing feelings of separation and alienation from those whom it might have gathered into its embrace, and thereby communicated, and in communicating acquired, courage and strength. We have all known the comfort of love; should it not impel us to live in ‘the unity of the spirit and the bond of peace’? Men around us are meant to be our helpers, and to be helped by us, and the one way to secure both is to walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But Paul has still further heart-melting motives to urge. He turns the Philippians’ thoughts to their fellowship in the Spirit. All believers have been made to drink into one spirit, and in that common participation in the same supernatural life they partake of a oneness, which renders any clefts or divisions unnatural, and contradictory of the deepest truths of their experience. The branch can no more shiver itself off from the tree, or keep the life sap enclosed within itself, than one possessor of the common gift of the Spirit can separate himself from the others who share it. We are one in Him; let us be one in heart and mind. The final appeal is connected with the preceding, inasmuch as it lays emphasis on the emotions which flow from the one life common to all believers. That participation in the Spirit naturally leads in each participant to ‘tender mercies and compassions’ directed to all sharers in it. The very mark of truly possessing the Spirit’s life is a nature full of tenderness and swift to pity, and they who have experienced the heaven on earth of such emotions should need no other motive than the memory of its blessedness, to send them out among their brethren, and even into a hostile world, as the apostles of love, the bearers of tender mercies, and the messengers of pity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. The fair ideal which would complete the Apostle’s joy.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We may gather from the rich abundance of motives which the Apostle suggests before he comes to present his exhortation, that he suspected the existence of some tendencies in the opposite direction in Philippi, and possibly the same conclusion may be drawn from the exuberance of the exhortation itself, and from its preceding the dehortation which follows. He does not scold, he scarcely even rebukes, but he begins by trying to melt away any light frost that had crept over the warmth of the Philippians’ love; and having made that preparation, he sets before them with a fulness which would be tautological but for the earnestness that throbs in it, the ideal of unity, and presses it upon them still more meltingly, by telling them that their realisation of it will be the completion of his joy. The main injunction is ‘that ye be of the same mind,’ and that is followed by three clauses which are all but exactly synonymous with it, ‘having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.’ The resemblance of the latter clause to the main exhortation is still more complete, if we read with Revised Version {margin} ‘of the same mind,’ but in any case the exhortations are all practically the same. The unity which Paul would fain see, is far deeper and more vital than mere unanimity of opinion, or identity of polity, or co-operation in practice. The clauses which expand it guard us against the mistake of thinking that intellectual or practical oneness is all that is meant by Christian unity. They are ‘of the same mind,’ who have the same wishes, aims, outlooks, the same hopes and fears, and who are one in the depths of their being. They have ‘the same love,’ all similarly loving and being loved, the same emotion filling each heart. They are united in soul, or ‘with accordant souls’ having, and knowing that they have them, akin, allied to one another, moving to a common end, and aware of their oneness. The unity which Christian people have hitherto reached is at its best but a small are of the great circle which the Apostle drew, and none of us can read these fervid words without shame. His joy is not yet fulfilled.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>That exhortation to be ‘of the same mind,’ not only points to a deep and vital unity, but suggests that the ground of the unity is to be found without us, in the common direction of our ‘minds,’ which means far more than popular phraseology means by it, to an external object. It is having our hearts directed to Christ that makes us one. He is the bond and centre of unity. We have just said that the object is external, but that has to be taken with a modification, for the true basis of unity is the common possession of ‘Christ in us.’ It is when we have this mind in us ‘which was also in Christ Jesus,’ that we have ‘the same mind’ one with another.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The very keynote of the letter is joy, as may be seen by a glance over it. He joys and rejoices with them all, but his cup is not quite full. One more precious drop is needed to make it run over. Probably the coldness which he had heard of between Euodias and Syntyche had troubled him, and if he could be sure of the Philippians’ mutual love he would rejoice in his prison. We cannot tell whether that loving and careful heart is still aware of the fortunes of the Church, but we know of a more loving and careful heart which is, and we cannot but believe that the alienations and discords of His professed followers bring some shadow over the joy of Christ. Do we not hear His voice again asking, ‘what was it that you disputed among yourselves by the way?’ and must we not, like the disciples, ‘hold our peace’ when that question is asked? May we not hear a voice sweeter in its cadence, and more melting in its tenderness than Paul’s, saying to us ‘Fulfil ye My joy that ye be of the same mind.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. The hindrances and helps to being of the same mind.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The original has no verb in front of ‘nothing’ in verse 3, and it seems better to supply the one which has been so frequently used in the preceding exhortation than ‘doing,’ which carries us too abruptly into the outer region of action. Paul indicates two main hindrances to being of the same mind, namely, faction and vainglory on the one hand, and self-absorption on the other, and opposed to each the tone of mind which is its best conqueror. Faction and vainglory are best defeated by humility and unselfishness. As to the former, the love of making or heading little cliques in religion or politics or society, has oftenest its roots in nothing loftier than vanity or pride. Many a man who poses as guided by staunch adherence to conviction is really impelled only by a wish to make himself notorious as a leader, and loves to talk of ‘those with whom I act.’ There is a strong admixture of a too lofty estimate of self in most of the disagreements of Christian people. They expect more deference than they get, or their judgment is not taken as law, or their place is not so high as they think is their due, or in a hundred different ways self-love is wounded, and self-esteem is inflamed. All this is true in reference to the smaller communities of congregations, and with the necessary modifications it is quite as true in reference to the larger aggregations which we call churches or denominations. If all in their work that is directly due to faction and vainglory were struck out there would be great gaps in their activities, and many a flourishing scheme would fall dead.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The cure for all these evils is lowliness of mind. That is a Christian word. Used by Greek thinkers, it meant abjectness; and it is one conspicuous instance of the change effected in morals by Christian teaching that it has become the name of a virtue. We are to dwell not on our gifts but on our imperfections, and if we judge ourselves with constant reference to the standard in Christ’s life, we shall need little more to bring us to our knees in true lowliness of mind. The man who has been forgiven so many talents will not be in a hurry to take his brother by the throat and leave the marks of his fingers for tenpence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Christian unity is further broken by selfishness. To be absorbed in self is of course to have the heart shut to others. Our own interests, inclinations, possessions, when they assert themselves in our lives, build up impassable barriers between us and our fellows. To live to self is the real root of every sin as it is of all loveless life. The Apostle uses careful language: he admits the necessity for attention to our ‘own things,’ and only requires that we should look ‘also’ on the things of others. His cure for the hindrances to Christian unity is very complete, very practical, and very simple. Each counting other better than himself, and each ‘looking also to the things of others’ seem very homely and pedestrian virtues, but homely as they are we shall find that they grip us tight, if we honestly try to practise them in our daily lives, and we shall find also that the ladder which has its foot on earth has its top in the heavens, and that the practice of humility and unselfishness leads straight to having ‘the mind which was also in Christ Jesus.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,">Php 2:1</a></span>. The apostle, in the latter part of the preceding chapter, having exhorted the Philippians to walk worthy of their Christian profession, by having their conversation according to the gospel; and, as nothing is more required by it, or can be more suitable to it, than mutual love among the followers of Christ, he here beseeches them, by every thing most affecting in Christianity, to fulfil his joy, by exercising that love. <span class="ital">If there be therefore any consolation in Christ </span>— And his grace, in his person and offices, in his humiliation and sufferings for you, or in his exaltation and glory. This is not an expression of doubt, but the strongest affirmation that there is the greatest consolation in him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-4.htm" title="Who comforts us in all our tribulation, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted of God.">2 Corinthians 1:4</a>. <span class="ital">If any comfort of love</span> — In the love of God to you, or in your love to him in return; <span class="ital">if any fellowship of the Spirit </span>— Any communion with the Father and the Son, through the Holy Spirit dwelling in you; <span class="ital">if any bowels and mercies </span>— Resulting therefrom; any tender affection toward each other, or any compassion for me, now a prisoner for Christ, <span class="ital">fulfil ye my joy </span>— To all the other causes of joy which I have concerning you, add this also, and make my joy complete; <span class="ital">that ye be like-minded </span>— That ye be alike disposed; that ye esteem, desire, and pursue the same thing, even your high and holy calling, as <span class="greekheb">το αυτο φρονητε </span>seems here to signify, it being explained in the following clauses as implying <span class="ital">having the same love, being of one accord; </span><span class="greekheb">συμψυχοι</span>, <span class="ital">united in soul, </span>or animated with the same affections and intentions; <span class="greekheb">το εν φρονουντες</span>, <span class="ital">minding; </span>that is, delighting in and aiming at <span class="ital">one thing, </span>namely, the glory of God, or the honour of Christ, in their salvation. It is justly observed by Macknight here, that the word <span class="greekheb">φρονειν</span>, rendered <span class="ital">to mind, </span>has different meanings in the New Testament. Sometimes it denotes an act of the understanding, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-22.htm" title="But we desire to hear of you what you think: for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.">Acts 28:22</a> : <span class="ital">We desire to hear of thee, </span><span class="greekheb">α φρονεις</span>, <span class="ital">what thou thinkest, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-10.htm" title="I have confidence in you through the Lord, that you will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubles you shall bear his judgment, whoever he be.">Galatians 5:10</a>; <span class="ital">That, </span><span class="greekheb">ουδεν αλλο φρονησετε</span>, <span class="ital">ye will think nothing differently. </span>Sometimes it denotes an act of the will, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:">Php 2:5</a>; <span class="greekheb">τουτο φρονεισθω</span>, <span class="ital">Let this disposition be in you which was even in Christ. </span>It signifies also to set one’s affections on an object so as to use every means in one’s power to obtain it, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-2.htm" title=" Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth.">Colossians 3:2</a>; <span class="greekheb">τα ανω φρονειτε</span>, <span class="ital">Set your affections on things above, </span>and endeavour to obtain them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-10.htm" title="But I rejoiced in the Lord greatly, that now at the last your care of me has flourished again; wherein you were also careful, but you lacked opportunity.">Php 4:10</a>, <span class="ital">I rejoiced that now at length, </span><span class="greekheb">ανεθαλλετε το υπερ εμου φρονειν</span>, <span class="ital">you have made your care of me to flourish again.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-4 Here are further exhortations to Christian duties; to like-mindedness and lowly-mindedness, according to the example of the Lord Jesus. Kindness is the law of Christ's kingdom, the lesson of his school, the livery of his family. Several motives to brotherly love are mentioned. If you expect or experience the benefit of God's compassions to yourselves, be compassionate one to another. It is the joy of ministers to see people like-minded. Christ came to humble us, let there not be among us a spirit of pride. We must be severe upon our own faults, and quick in observing our own defects, but ready to make favourable allowances for others. We must kindly care for others, but not be busy-bodies in other men's matters. Neither inward nor outward peace can be enjoyed, without lowliness of mind.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If there be therefore any consolation in Christ - This, with what is said in the remainder of the verse, is designed as a motive for what he exhorts them to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm">Philippians 2:2</a> - that they would be of the same mind, and would thus fulfill his joy. To urge them to this, he appeals to the tender considerations which religion furnished - and begins by a reference to the consolation which there was in Christ. The meaning here may be this: "I am now persecuted and afflicted. In my trials it will give me the highest joy to learn that you act as becomes Christians. You also are persecuted and afflicted <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-28.htm">Philippians 1:28-30</a>; and, in these circumstances, I entreat that the highest consolation may be sought; and by all that is tender and sacred in the Christian religion, I conjure you, so to live as not to dishonor the gospel. So live as to bring down the highest consolation which can be obtained - the consolation which Christ alone can impart We are not to suppose that Paul doubted whether there was any consolation in Christ but the form of expression here is one that is designed to urge upon them the duty of seeking the highest possible. The consolation in Christ is that which Christ furnishes or imparts. Paul regarded him as the source of all comfort, and earnestly prays that they might so live that he and they might avail themselves in the fullest sense of that unspeakable enjoyment. The idea is, that Christians ought at all times, and especially in affliction, so to act as to secure the highest possible happiness which their Saviour can impart to them. Such an object is worth their highest effort; and if God sees it needful, in order to that, that they should endure much affliction, still it is gain. Religious consolation is always worth all which it costs to secure it.<p>If any comfort of love - If there be any comfort in the exercise of tender affection. That there is, no one can doubt. Our happiness is almost all centered in love. It is when we love a parent, a wife, a child, a sister, a neighbor, that we have the highest earthly enjoyment. It is in the love of God, of Christ, of Christians, of the souls of people, that the redeemed find their highest happiness. Hatred is a passion full of misery; love an emotion full of joy. By this consideration, Paul appeals to them, and the motive here is drawn from all the joy which mutual love and sympathy are fitted to produce in the soul Paul would have that love exercised in the highest degree, and would have them enjoy all the happiness which its mutual exercise could furnish.<p>If any fellowship of the Spirit - The word "fellowship - &#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  koino&#772;nia - means that which is common to two or more; that of which they partake together; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-9.htm">Ephesians 3:9</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-5.htm">Philippians 1:5</a> note. The idea here is, that among Christians there was a participation in the influences of the Holy Spirit; that they shared in some degree the feelings, views, and joys of the Sacred Spirit Himself; and that this was a privilege of the highest order. By this fact, Paul now exhorts them to unity, love, and zeal - so to live that they might partake in the highest degree of the consolations of this Spirit.<p>If any bowels and mercies - If there is any affectionate bond by which you are united to me, and any regard for my sorrows, and any desire to fill up my joys, so live as to impart to me, your spiritual father and friend, the consolation which I seek. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>Php 2:1-30.

His Intention to Send Timothy: His Sending Epaphroditus Meantime.<p>1. The "therefore" implies that he is here expanding on the exhortation (Php 1:27), "In one Spirit, with one mind (soul)." He urges four influencing motives in this verse, to inculcate the four Christian duties corresponding respectively to them (Php 2:2). "That ye be like-minded, having the same love, of one accord, of one mind"; (1) "If there be (with you) any consolation in Christ," that is, any consolation of which Christ is the source, leading you to wish to console me in my afflictions borne for Christ's sake, ye owe it to me to grant my request "that ye be like-minded" [Chrysostom and Estius]: (2) "If there be any comfort of (that is, flowing from) love," the adjunct of "consolation in Christ"; (3) "If any fellowship of (communion together as Christians, flowing from joint participation in) the Spirit" (2Co 13:14).

Hence the idea is: “<span class="ital">If there is exhortation in Christ</span>, wherewith one brother animates and incites another to a right tone and attitude; <span class="ital">if there is comfort of love</span>, whereby one refresheth the other; <span class="ital">if there is fellowship in the Spirit</span>, which inspires right feelings, and confers the consecration of power; <span class="ital">if there is a heart and compassion</span>, issuing in sympathy with, and compassion for, the afflicted,—manifest all these towards me, in that <span class="ital">ye make full my joy</span> (<span class="greekheb">μου τὴν χαράν</span>).” Then, namely, I experience practically from you that Christian-brotherly <span class="ital">exhortation</span>,[87] and share in your <span class="ital">comfort of love</span>, and so ye put to proof, in my case, the <span class="ital">fellowship in the Spirit</span> and the <span class="ital">cordial sympathy</span>, which makes me not distressed, but glad in my painful position.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>There is much that is mistaken in the views of those who defend the reading <span class="greekheb">τις</span> before <span class="greekheb">σπλ</span>. (see van Hengel and Reiche), which cannot be got rid of by the assumption of a <span class="ital">constructio ad synesin</span> (in opposition to Buttmann, <span class="ital">Neut. Gr</span>. p. 71. [E. T. 81]). Hofmann is driven by this reading, which he maintains, to the strange misinterpretation of the whole verse as if it <span class="ital">contained only protases and apodoses</span>, to be thus divided: <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις οὖν παράκλησις</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>· <span class="greekheb">εἴ τι παραμύθιον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπης</span>· <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις κοινωνία πνεύματος</span>, <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span>, <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἰκτιρμοί</span>; this last <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span> being a <span class="ital">repetition</span> of the <span class="ital">previous one</span> with an <span class="ital">emphasizing</span> of the <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>. Accordingly the verse is supposed to mean: “If exhortation, let it be exhortation in Christ; if consolation, let it be a consolation of love; if fellowship of the Spirit, if any, let it be cordiality and compassion.” A new sentence would then begin with <span class="greekheb">πληρώσατε</span>.[88] Artifices such as this can only serve to recommend the reading <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἼ ΤΙΝΑ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[85] Hitzig, <span class="ital">z. Krit. Paul.

The will, feelings, and intellect are called into exercise by both. Comp., especially on <span class="greekheb">παραμύθ</span>., Stallbaum, <span class="ital">ad Plat.

Ewald) cannot he conceived as the <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[88] From this interpretation of the whole passage he should have been deterred by the forlorn position which is assigned to the <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span> before <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα</span> as the stone of stumbling, as well as by the purposelessness and even inappropriateness of an oddly emphasized <span class="ital">problematical</span> sense of this <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span>.—If it be thought that the reading <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις σπλ</span>. must be admitted. I would simply suggest the following by way of necessary explanation of the passage:—1st, Let the verse be regarded as consisting of a series of <span class="ital">four protases</span>, on which the apodosis then follows in ver. 2; 2d, Let <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀγάπης</span>, <span class="greekheb">πνεύματος</span> and <span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἰκτιρμοί</span> be taken uniformly as <span class="ital">predicative</span> specifications; 3d, Let <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> be again understood with the last <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span>. Paul would accordingly say: <span class="ital">“If any exhortation is exhortation in Christ, if any comfort is comfort of love, if any fellowship is fellowship of the Spirit, if any</span> (fellowship) <span class="ital">is cordiality and compassion</span> (that is, full of cordiality and compassion) <span class="ital">fulfil ye</span>,” etc. The apostle would thus give to the element of the <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>, besides the <span class="ital">objective</span> definition of its nature (<span class="greekheb">πνεύματος</span>, referring to the <span class="ital">Holy</span> Spirit), also a <span class="ital">subjective</span> one (<span class="greekheb">σπλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σἰκτιρμ</span>.), and mark the latter specially by the repetition of <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span>, <span class="ital">sc</span> <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span>., as well as designate it the more forcibly by the <span class="ital">nominative</span> expression (<span class="greekheb">σπλάγχνα κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οἰκτ</span>., not another genitive), inasmuch as the latter would set forth the <span class="ital">ethical nature</span> of such a <span class="greekheb">κοινωνία</span> (comp. such passages as <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-7.htm" title="What shall we say then?

The <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span>, moreover, would remain uniformly the <span class="ital">syllogistic</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰ</span> in all the four clauses, and not, as in Hofmann’s view, suddenly change into the problematic sense in the fourth clause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philippians/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-1.htm" title="If there be therefore any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies,...">Php 2:1-4</a>.

The Greek word, in its prevailing meaning, denotes rather encouragement, strengthening, than the tenderer “consolation”; and the word “comfort”, by its derivation (<span class="ital">con</span>fort<span class="ital">atio</span>), may fairly represent it.

See last note but one.—The word occurs here only in N.T.

Context and parallels are necessary to the decision in each place. And in this place the parallel (2 Cor.) quoted, seems to us to point clearly to the highest reference—to “the one and the selfsame Spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-11.htm" title="But all these works that one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will.">1 Corinthians 12:11</a>), the promised Paraclete Himself, Whom all the saints “share” as their common Life-Giver, Strengthener, and Sanctifier.—“<span class="ital">Fellowship of</span>” might grammatically mean “union of heart and interests, prompted by.” But usage is decisively for the meaning “<span class="ital">participation in</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bowels and mercies</span>] Better, with R.V., <span class="bld">tender mercies and compassions</span>.

If any comfort of love; comfort springing out of love. Love is the subjective result of the presence of Christ as an objective reality, and with love comes comfort (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-3.htm">1 Corinthians 14:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-11.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:11</a>). <span class="cmt_word">If any fellowship of the Spirit</span>. If the indwelling of the Holy Ghost be true, a felt reality in the Christian life.

Bowels (see note on Philippians 1:8), the seat of the feelings of compassion; mercies, those feelings themselves.

"Under any circumstances," says Bishop Lightfoot, "the reading <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f34;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is a valuable testimony to the scrupulous fidelity of the early transcribers, who copied the text as they found it, even when it contained readings so manifestly difficult."  <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Therefore<p>Paul has spoken, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-26.htm">Philippians 1:26</a>, of the Philippians' joy in his presence. Their joy is to find expression in duty - in the fulfillment of their obligations as members of the christian commonwealth, by fighting the good fight of faith and cheerfully appropriating the gift of suffering (<a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27-29</a>). <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-30.htm">Philippians 2:30</a>, alluding to his own conflicts, marks the transition from the thought of their joy to that of his joy.

So Plato: "Let this, then, be our exhortation concerning marriage" ("Laws," 773). A motive of persuasion or dissuasion. Plato, speaking of the fear of disgrace, or of ill-repute, says. "The obedient nature will readily yield to such incentives" ("Laws," 880). Also an assuagement or abatement. So Sophocles: "Offspring of the noble, ye are come as the assuagement of my woes" ("Electra," 130). Plato: "They say that to the rich are many consolations" ("Republic," 329). Plato also calls certain fruits stimulants (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3b8;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;) of a sated appetite ("Critias," 115). Here in the sense of incentive.
