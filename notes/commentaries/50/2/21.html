The brothers which are with me greet you.">Philippians 4:21</a>).

Naturally, that is, sincerely, and not in pretence only; with a willing heart and upright views. We are apt to prefer our own credit, ease, and safety, before truth, holiness, and duty; but Timothy did not so. Paul desired liberty, not that he might take pleasure, but that he might do good. Epaphroditus was willing to go to the Philippians, that he might be comforted with those who had sorrowed for him when he was sick. It seems, his illness was caused by the work of God. The apostle urges them to love him the more on that account. It is doubly pleasant to have our mercies restored by God, after great danger of their removal; and this should make them more valued. What is given in answer to prayer, should be received with great thankfulness and joy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For all seek their own - That is, all who are with me. Who Paul had with him at this time is not fully known, but he doubtless means that this remark should apply to the mass of Christians and Christian ministers then in Rome. Perhaps he had proposed to some of them to go and visit the church at Philippi, and they had declined it because of the distance and the dangers of the way. When the trial of Paul came on before the emperor, all who were with him in Rome fled from him <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-16.htm">2 Timothy 4:16</a>, and it is possible that the same disregard of his wishes and his welfare had already begun to manifest itself among the Christians who were at Rome, so that he was constrained to say that, as a general thing, they sought their own ease and comfort, and were unwilling to deny themselves in order to promote the happiness of those who lived in the remote parts of the world. Let us not be harsh in judging them. How many professing Christians in our cities and towns are there now who would be willing to leave their business and their comfortable homes and go on embassy like this to Philippi? How many are there who would not seek some excuse, and show that it was a characteristic that they "sought their own" rather than the things which pertained to the kingdom of Jesus Christ?<p>Not the things which are Jesus Christ's - Which pertain to his cause and kingdom. They are not willing to practice self-denial in order to promote that cause. It is implied here:<p>(1) that it is the duty of those who profess religion to seek the things which pertain to the kingdom of the Redeemer, or to make that the great and leading object of their lives. They are bound to be willing to sacrifice their own things - to deny themselves of ease, and to be always ready to expose themselves to peril and want if they may be the means of advancing his cause.<p>(2) that frequently this is not done by those who profess religion. It was the case with the professed Christians at Rome, and it is often the case in the churches now. There are few Christians who deny themselves much to promote the kingdom of the Redeemer; few who are willing to lay aside what they regard as their own in order to advance his cause. People live for their own ease; for their families; for the prosecution of their own business - as if a Christian could have anything which he has a right to pursue independently of the kingdom of the Redeemer, and without regard to his will and glory. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21.

Meaning not every individual, but the greatest part; and not merely such as were manifestly false teachers, but such as were with the apostle, as ministers of the word; and we may suppose him to be stripped, by one means or another, of the more valuable preachers of the Gospel, and to be in much such a case as he describes himself to be, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>. He had none with him, excepting a very few, but such as he speaks of in the preceding chapter, that preached Christ of envy, strife, and contention; and these chiefly sought their own worldly interest and advantage; they sought great things for themselves, and looked every man for his gain from his quarter, Demas like, loving this present world, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm">2 Timothy 4:10</a>; they sought for dominion and authority over men, and their faith, to lord it over God's heritage, as Diotrephes, who loved to have the preeminence, <a href="https://biblehub.com/3_john/1-9.htm">3 John 1:9</a>; they sought for popular applause, for honour and glory of men, as the Pharisees of old did; and particularly their own ease and health, and did not choose to undertake such a fatiguing journey as from Rome to Philippi: <p>not the things which are Jesus Christ; they had no true regard to the Gospel of Christ, to the continuance, establishment, and spread of it in the world, or in any particular place; nor any hearty affection for the ordinances of Christ, and the retaining and preserving of them in their purity and simplicity; nor for the churches of Christ, and their spiritual good and welfare, as the Jews formerly, they cared not if the house of God lay waste, provided they dwelt in their ceiled houses; nor had they any concern for the honour and glory of Christ. But Timothy was a man of a quite different spirit and complexion; and which is another reason of the apostle's sending him to this place and people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For <span class="cverse3">{r}</span> all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.</span><p>(r) The most part.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-21.htm" title="For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's.">Php 2:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ πάντες</span>] <span class="ital">all</span> (except Timothy), of those whom I now have with me and at my disposal for sending; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Php 2:20</a>.

The only limitation of the general expression, which is in accordance with the text, lies in the fact that Paul does not mean the Christians generally in Rome, but such <span class="ital">assistant teachers</span> as would otherwise, if they had been pure and honest, have been <span class="ital">qualified</span> for such a mission. The trustworthy ones among these otherwise qualified fellow-labourers must have been <span class="ital">absent</span> at the time, especially <span class="ital">Luke</span>, who could by no means have been included among <span class="greekheb">οἱ πάντες</span> (in opposition to Wieseler, <span class="ital">Chronol. d. apost. Zeitalt</span>. p. 427); hence the Philippians are not <span class="ital">saluted specially</span> either by Luke or by any other, and the omission of such salutations by name at the end of this epistle receives in part its explanation from this passage. Consequently, <span class="greekheb">οἱ πάντ</span>. cannot be understood as <span class="ital">many</span> or the <span class="ital">most</span> (Beza, Wolf, Hammond, Drusius, Estius, Grotius, Cornelius a Lapide, and others, including Heinrichs, Rheinwald, Flatt); nor is it: “all, <span class="ital">whom I can spare</span>” (Erasmus), or: “<span class="ital">who are known to you</span>” (van Hengel). Neither is the negation to be taken <span class="ital">relatively:</span> they seek <span class="ital">more</span> their own interest, etc. (Erasmus, Calvin, and many others, also Flatt, Hoelemann, comp. the reservations of Weiss), to which Hofmann’s view [138] also ultimately comes; nor is it to be explained by assuming an intention of <span class="ital">distinguishing Timothy</span> (Matthies); nor yet is the judgment to be restricted, with Chrysostom, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, to the hardships <span class="ital">of the long journey</span>, to which they preferred <span class="ital">their own repose</span>. Bengel rightly defends the full seriousness of the utterance, and adds: “subtilissima erat <span class="greekheb">αἴσθησις</span>, qua hoc percepit Paulus.” But Baur erroneously discovers here merely an <span class="ital">exaggeration</span>, which arose from the subjectivity of a later author.

This verse has roused surprise. Where were all Paul’s faithful brethren in the Lord? Has he no one but Timothy to fall back upon? It must be borne in mind that we have to do with a simple letter, not a treatise, or history of Paul’s work. The Apostle speaks in an outburst of strong feeling, for he is a man of quick impulses. He does not for a moment mean that he has no genuine Christian brethren in his company. But he had found, in all probability, that when he proposed to some of his companions, good Christian men, that they should visit far-distant Philippi, they all shrank, making various excuses. Timothy alone is willing, the one man he can least afford to spare. It is hard to part with him at such a critical time. No wonder that he should feel hurt by this want of inclination on the part of the other brethren to undertake an important Christian duty. No wonder that he should speak with severity of a disposition so completely opposed to his own. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-33.htm" title="Even as I please all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of many, that they may be saved.">1 Corinthians 10:33</a>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ ζητῶν τὸ ἐμαυτοῦ σύμφορον ἀλλὰ τὸ τῶν πολλῶν</span>. See esp[11] Calvin’s excellent note <span class="ital">ad loc.</span>—<span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. The authorities are almost equally balanced as to the readings. See on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm" title="Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:">Php 1:1</a> <span class="ital">supr.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[11]</span> especially.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/philippians/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">21</span>. <span class="ital">all</span>] The Greek would be more exactly represented by <span class="bld">they all</span>, or <span class="bld">all of them;</span> all of a definite group in question. This is a severe censure on the persons really indicated. St Paul must have suffered grave disappointments where he had a special right to expect ready help. Demas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2 Timothy 4:10</a>) had his precursors; indeed he may have been included in this censure, for he was at Rome about this time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-14.htm" title=" Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, greet you.">Colossians 4:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philemon/1-24.htm" title="Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellow laborers.">Philemon 1:24</a>). But we must not assume that St Paul here (or even <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-10.htm" title="For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.">2 Timothy 4:10</a>) excommunicates, so to speak, those whom he refers to; the true disciple may have his weak, because faithless and selfish, hour. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-13.htm" title="Now when Paul and his company loosed from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia: and John departing from them returned to Jerusalem.">Acts 13:13</a>, with <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-38.htm" title="But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.">Acts 15:38</a>, and contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-11.htm" title="Only Luke is with me.

He must mean not “all the Christians around me,” but “all the possible Christian messengers around me.” “The saints of Cæsar’s household” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-22.htm" title="All the saints salute you, chiefly they that are of Caesar's household.">Php 4:22</a>), for example, could not be in question; nor was Epaphroditus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-25.htm" title="Yet I supposed it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother, and companion in labor, and fellow soldier, but your messenger, and he that ministered to my wants.">Php 2:25</a>, &c).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">seek their own] things</span>, literally; their own ease or safety; perhaps their own preferences in toil and duty.

He calls those about him brethren in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-21.htm">Philippians 4:21</a>; but, it seems, they were like St. Paul, not willing to spend and to be spent for the salvation of souls. It was a great sacrifice in one who so yearned for Christian sympathy to submit to the absence of the one true loving friend. St. Paul's spiritual isolation increases our wonder and admiration for the strain of holy joy which runs through this Epistle. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;)<p>The all; that is, one and all.

It probably means, all except Timothy, that he has at his disposal of those who would naturally be selected for such an office. </body></html>
