As Chrysostom says here, “When the sun hath appeared, it is loss to sit by a candle.” The light of the candle in the sunlight actually casts a shadow. How that knowledge is gained we learn in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/3-17.htm" title="That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith; that you, being rooted and grounded in love,">Ephesians 3:17-18</a>, “That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith: that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may . . . know the love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.”<p><span class= "bld">Dung.</span>—The word appears to mean “refuse” of any kind. The sense adopted in our version is common. Dr. Lightfoot, however, quotes instances of its use for the fragments from a feast, and remarks on the old derivation of the word from that which is “thrown to dogs,” which, however etymologically questionable, shows the idea attached to the word. This use would suit well enough with the ideas suggested by the retort of the name “dogs” on the Judaisers.<p><span class= "bld">I suffered the loss of all things.</span>—There seems to be here a play on words. These things were (he has said) loss; he suffered the loss of them: and the loss of a loss is a “gain.”<p><span class= "bld">That I may win</span> (properly, <span class= "ital">gain</span>) <span class= "bld">Christ, and be found in him.</span>—The line of thought in these two clauses is like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/4-9.htm" title="But now, after that you have known God, or rather are known of God, how turn you again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto you desire again to be in bondage?">Galatians 4:9</a>, “Now that ye have known God, or rather are known of God.” The first idea suggested by the context is that of “gaining Christ,” finding Him and laying hold of Him by faith; but this, if taken alone, is unsatisfactory, as resting too much on the action of man. Hence St. Paul adds, and “be found (of God) in Him,” drawn into union with Him by the grace of God, so that we may “dwell in Him, and He in us,” and be “found” abiding in Him in each day of God’s visitation.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE GAIN OF CHRIST</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,...">Php 3:8-9</a> {R.V.}. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not everybody who can say what is his aim in life. Many of us have never thought enough about it to have one beyond keeping alive. We lose life in seeking for the means of living. Many of us have such a multitude of aims, each in its turn drawing us, that no one of them is predominant and rules the crowd. There is no strong hand at the tiller, and so the ship washes about in the trough of the waves.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is not everybody who dares to say what is his aim in life. We are ashamed to acknowledge even to ourselves what we are not at all ashamed to do. Paul knew his aim, and was not afraid to speak it. It was high and noble, and was passionately and persistently pursued. He tells us it here, and we can see his soul kindling as he speaks. We may note how there is here the same double reference as we found in the previous verses, gaining Christ corresponding to the previous loss for Christ, and the later words of our text being an expansion of the ‘excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus.’ No man will ever succeed in any life’s purpose, unless like Paul he is enthusiastic about it. If his aim does not rouse his fervour when he speaks of it, he will never accomplish it. We may just remark that Paul does not suppose his aim to be wholly unattained, even although he does not count himself to ‘have apprehended.’ He knows that he has gained Christ, and is ‘found in Him,’ but he knows also that there stretch before him the possibilities of infinite increase.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. His life’s aim was to have the closest possession of, and incorporation in, Christ.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>His two expressions, ‘that I may gain Christ and be found in Him,’ are substantially identical in meaning, though they put the same truth from different sides, and with some variety of metaphor. We may deal with them separately.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ‘gain’ is of course the opposite of the ‘loss.’ His balance-sheet has on one side ‘all things lost,’ on the other ‘Christ gained,’ and that is profitable trading. But we have to go deeper than such a metaphor, and to give full scope to the Scriptural truth, that Christ really imparts Himself to the believing soul. There is a real communication of His own life to us, and thereby we live, as He Himself declared, ‘He that hath the Son hath life.’ The true deep sense in which we possess Christ is not to be weakened down, as it, alas! so often is in our shallow Christianity, which is but the echo of a shallow experience, and a feeble hold of that possession of the Son to which Jesus called us, as the condition of our possession of life. Christ is thus Himself possessed by all our faculties, each after its kind; head and heart, passions and desires, hopes and longings, may each have Him abiding in them, guiding them with His strong and gentle hand, animating them into nobler life, restraining and controlling, gradually transforming and ultimately conforming them to His own likeness. Till that Divine Indweller enters in, the shrine is empty, and unclean things lurk in its hidden corners. To be a man full summed in all his powers, each of us must ‘gain Christ.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The other expression in the text, ‘be found in Him,’ presents the same truth from the completing point of view. We gain Christ in us when we are ‘found in Him.’ We are to be incorporated as members are in the body, or imbedded as a stone in the foundation, or to go back to the sweetest words, which are the source of all these representations, included as ‘a branch in the vine.’ We are to be in Him for safety and shelter, as fugitives take refuge in a strong tower when an enemy swarms over the land.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘<span class="ital">And lo! from sin and grief and shame, I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.</span>’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We are to be in Him that the life sap may freely flow through us. We are to be in Him that the Divine Love may fall on us, and that in Jesus we may receive our portion of all which is His heritage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This mutual possession and indwelling is possible if Jesus be the Son of God, but the language is absurd in any other interpretation of His person. It is clearly in its very nature capable of indefinite increase, and as containing in itself the supply of all which we need for life and blessedness, is fitted to be what nothing else can pretend to be, without wrecking the lives that are unwise enough to pursue it--the sovereign aim of a human life. In following it, and only in following it, the highest wisdom says Amen to the aspiration of the lowliest faith. ‘This one thing I do.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Paul’s life’s aim was righteousness to be received.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He goes on to present some of the consequences which follow on his gaining Christ and being ‘found in Him,’ and before all others he names as his aim the possession of ‘righteousness.’ We must remember that Paul believed that righteousness in the sense of ‘justification’ had been his from the moment when Ananias came to where he was sitting in darkness, and bid him be baptized and wash away his sins. The word here must be taken in its full sense of moral perfectness; even if we included only this in our thoughts of his life’s aim, how high above most men would he tower! But his statement carries him still higher above, and farther away from, the common ideas of moral perfection, and what he means by righteousness is widely separated from the world’s conception, not only in regard to its elements, but still more in regard to its source.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is possible to lose oneself in a dreamy mysticism which has had much to say of ‘gaining Christ and being found in Him,’ and has had too little to say about ‘having righteousness,’ and so has turned out to be an ally of indifference and sometimes of unrighteousness. Buddhism and some forms of mystical Christianity have fallen into a pit of immorality from which Paul’s sane combination here would have saved them. There is no danger in the most mystical interpretation of the former statement of his aim, when it is as closely connected as it is here with the second form in which he states it. I have just said that Paul differed from men who were seeking for righteousness, not only because his conceptions of what constituted it were not the same as theirs, though he in this very letter endorses the Greek ideals of ‘virtue and praise,’ but also and more emphatically because he looked for it as a gift, and not as the result of his own efforts. To him the only righteousness which availed was one which was not ‘my own,’ but had its source in, and was imparted by, God. The world thought of righteousness as the general designation under which were summed up a man’s specific acts of conformity to law, the sum total reached by the addition of many specific instances of conformity to a standard of duty. Paul had learned to think of it as preceding and producing the specific acts. The world therefore said, and says, Do the deeds and win the character; Paul says, Receive the character and do the deeds. The result of the one conception of righteousness is in the average man spasmodic efforts after isolated achievements, with long periods between in which effort subsides into torpor. The result in Paul’s case was what we know: a continuous effort to keep his mind and heart open for the influx of the power which, entering into him, would make him able to do the specific acts which constitute righteousness. The one road is a weary path, hard to tread, and, as a matter of fact, not often trodden. To pile up a righteousness by the accumulation of individual righteous acts is an endeavour less hopeful than that of the coral polypes slowly building up their reef out of the depths of the Pacific, till it rises above the waves. He who assumes to be righteous on the strength of a succession of righteous acts, not only needs a profounder idea of what makes his acts righteous, but should also make a catalogue of his unrighteous ones and call himself wicked. The other course is the final deliverance of a man from dependence upon his own struggles, and substitutes for the dreary alternations of effort and torpor, and for the imperfect harvest of imperfectly righteous acts, the attitude of receiving, which supersedes painful strife and weary endeavour. To seek after a righteousness which is ‘my own,’ is to seek what we shall never find, and what, if found, would crumble beneath us. To seek the righteousness which is from God, is to seek what He is waiting to bestow, and what the blessed receivers blessedly know is more than they dreamed of.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But Paul looked for this great gift as a gift in Christ. It was when he was ‘found in Him’ that it became his, and he was found ‘blameless.’ That gift of an imparted life, which has a bias towards all goodness, and the natural operation of which is to incline all our faculties towards conformity with the will of God, is bestowed when we ‘win Christ.’ Possessing Him, we possess it. It is not only ‘imputed,’ as our fathers delighted to say, but it is ‘imparted.’ And because it is the gift of God in Christ, it was in Paul’s view received by faith. He expresses that conviction in a double form in our text. It is ‘through faith’ as the channel by which it passes into our happy hands. It is ‘by faith,’ or, more accurately, ‘upon faith,’ as the foundation on which it rests, or the condition on which it depends. Our trust in Christ does bring His life to us to sanctify us, and the plain English of all this blessed teaching is--if we wish to be better let us trust Christ and get Him into the depths of our lives, and righteousness will be ours. That transforming Presence laid up in ‘the hidden man of the heart,’ will be like some pungent scent in a wardrobe which keeps away moths, and gives out a fragrance that perfumes all that hangs near it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But all which we have been saying is not to be understood as if there was no effort to be made, in order to receive, and to live manifesting, the ‘righteousness which is of God.’ There must be the constant abandonment of self, and the constant utilising of the grace given. The righteousness is bestowed whenever faith is exercised. The hand is never stretched out and the gift not lodged in it. But it is a life’s aim to possess the ‘righteousness which is of God by faith,’ because that gift is capable of indefinite increase, and will reward the most strenuous efforts of a believing soul as long as life continues.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Paul’s life’s aim stretches beyond this life.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Shall we be chargeable with crowding too much meaning into his words, if we fix on his remarkable expression, ‘be found in Him,’ as containing a clear reference to that great day of final judgment? We recall other instances of the use of the same expression in connections which unmistakably point to that time. Such as ‘being clothed we shall not be found naked,’ or ‘the proof of your faith . . . might be found unto praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ,’ or ‘found of Him in peace without spot, blameless.’ In the light of these and similar passages, it does not seem unreasonable to suppose that this ‘being found’ does include a reference to the Apostle’s place after death, though it is not confined to that. He thinks of the searching eye of the Judge taking keen account, piercing through all disguises, and wistfully as well as penetratingly scrutinising characters, till it finds that for which it seeks. They who are ‘found in Him’ in that day, are there and thus for ever. There is no further fear of falling out of union with Him, or of being, by either gradual and unconscious stages, or by sudden and overmastering assaults, carried out of the sacred enclosure of the City of Refuge in which they dwell henceforth for ever. A dangerous presumptuousness has sometimes led to the over-confident assertion, ‘Once in Christ always in Christ.’ But Paul teaches us that that security of permanent dwelling in Him is to be for ever in this life the aim of our efforts, rather than an accomplished fact. So long as we are here, the possibility of falling away cannot be shut out, and there must always rise before us the question, Am I in Christ? Hence there is need for continual watchfulness, self-control, and self-distrust, and the life’s aim has to be perpetual, not only because it is capable of indefinite expansion, but because our weakness is capable of deserting it. It is only when at the last we are found by Him, in Him, that we are there for ever, with all dangers of departure from Him at an end. In that City of Refuge, and there only, ‘the gates shall not be shut at all,’ not solely because no enemies shall attempt to come in, but also because no citizens shall desire to go out.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We should ever have before us that hour, and our life’s aim should ever definitely include the final scrutiny in which many a hidden thing will come to light, many a long-lost thing be found, and each man’s ultimate place in relation to Jesus Christ will be freed from uncertainties, ambiguities, hypocrisies, and disguises, and made plain to all beholders. In that great day of ‘finding,’ some of us will have to ask with sinking hearts, ‘Hast thou found me, O mine enemy?’ and others will break forth into the glad acclaim, ‘I have found Him,’ or rather ‘been found of Him.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So we have before us the one reasonable aim for a man to have Christ, to be found in Him, to have His righteousness. It is reasonable, it is great enough to absorb all our energies, and to reward them. It will last a lifetime, and run on undisturbed beyond life. Following it, all other aims will fall into their places. Is this my aim? <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,...">Php 3:8-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Yea doubtless </span>— Not only when I was first converted, but I still <span class="ital">account </span>both these and all things else, how valuable soever, to be <span class="ital">but loss. </span>Having said, in the preceding verse, that he counted his privileges as a Jew, and his righteousness by the law, to be <span class="ital">loss, </span>or things to be thrown away, he here adds, that he viewed in the same light all the things which men value themselves upon, and on which they build their hope of salvation: such as their natural and acquired talents, their knowledge, their moral virtue, and even their good works; yea, and all the riches, honours, and pleasures of the world; all the things in which people seek their happiness. <span class="ital">For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord </span>— In comparison of, and in order that I may attain, the experimental and practical knowledge of Christ, as my Lord, as my teaching Prophet, my atoning and mediating Priest, my delivering and ruling King, reigning in my heart by his grace, and governing my life by his laws. For the apostle evidently had a respect here to all the offices and characters of Christ, and intended what he says to be understood of sanctification and practical obedience, as much as of illumination and justification. And he accounted all the things he speaks of as worthless, not only because they were ineffectual to procure for him acceptance with God, but because in themselves they are of little value in comparison with the true knowledge of Christ, and of the way of salvation through him; blessings which the apostle so regarded, that he despised all other knowledge, and every human attainment, as things comparatively unworthy of his care, while pursuing his way to eternal life. <span class="ital">For whom I have </span>actually <span class="ital">suffered the loss of all things </span>— Which the world esteems, admires, loves, and delights in. It seems probable, from this, that he had been excommunicated by the Jews in Jerusalem, and spoiled of his goods: a treatment which some others, who were not so obnoxious to the Jews as he was, met with after they became Christians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-33.htm" title="Partly, whilst you were made a spectacle both by reproaches and afflictions; and partly, whilst you became companions of them that were so used....">Hebrews 10:33-34</a>. <span class="ital">And I count them but dung </span>— So far am I from repenting, that I exposed myself to the loss of them.

The Greek word, so rendered, signifies any vile refuse of things, the dross of metals, the dregs of liquors, the excrements of animals, the most worthless scraps of meat, the basest offals, fit only for dogs: in such a light did the apostle view every thing that would engage his dependance for justification, or stand in competition with Christ for his affection. <span class="ital">That I may win Christ </span>— May have him for my Saviour and Lord; may have an interest in all the offices that he sustains, and in all he hath done and suffered for the salvation of men, and may be made partaker of the benefits which he hath procured for me. <span class="ital">And be found in him </span>—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Vitally united to him by faith and love; <span class="ital">not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law </span>— That merely outward righteousness prescribed by the law, and performed in my own strength; <span class="ital">but that which is through the faith of Christ </span>— That justifying, sanctifying, and practical righteousness which is attained through believing in Christ, and in the truths and promises of his gospel.

The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Yea, doubtless, and I count all things but loss - Not only those things which he had just specified, and which he had himself possessed, he says he would be willing to renounce in order to obtain an interest in the Saviour, but everything which could be imagined. Were all the wealth and honor which could be conceived of his, he would be willing to renounce them in order that he might obtain the knowledge of the Redeemer. He would be a gainer who should sacrifice everything in order to win Christ. Paul had not only acted on this principle when he became a Christian, but had ever afterward continued to be ready to give up everything in order that he might obtain an interest in the Saviour. He uses here the same word -  &#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;  ze&#772;mian - which he does in the Acts of the Apostles, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-21.htm">Acts 27:21</a>, when speaking of the loss which had been sustained by loosing from Crete, contrary to his advice, on the voyage to Rome. The idea here seems to be, "What I might obtain, or did possess, I regard as loss in comparison with the knowledge of Christ, even as seamen do the goods on which they set a high value, in comparison with their lives. Valuable as they may be, they are willing to throw them all overboard in order to save themselves." Burder, in Ros. Alt. u. neu. Morgenland, in loc.<p>For the excellency of the knowledge - A Hebrew expression to denote excellent knowledge. The idea is, that he held everything else to be worthless in comparison with that knowledge, and he was willing to sacrifice everything else in order to obtain it. On the value of this knowledge of the Saviour, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm">Ephesians 3:19</a>.<p>For whom I have suffered the loss of all things - Paul, when he became a Christian, gave up his brilliant prospects in regard to this life, and everything indeed on which his heart had been placed. He abandoned the hope of honor and distinction; he sacrificed every prospect of gain or ease; and he gave up his dearest friends and separated himself from those whom he tenderly loved. He might have risen to the highest posts of honor in his native land, and the path which an ambitious young man desires was fully open before him. But all this had been cheerfully sacrificed in order that he might obtain an interest in the Saviour, and partake of the blessings of his religion. He has not, indeed, informed us of the exact extent of his loss in becoming a Christian. It is by no means improbable that he had been excommunicated by the Jews; and that he had been disowned by his own family.<p>And do count them but dung - The word used here - &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  skubalon - occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means, properly, dregs; refuse; what is thrown away as worthless; chaff; offal, or the refuse of a table or of slaughtered animals, and then filth of any kind. No language could express a more deep sense of the utter worthlessness of all that external advantages can confer in the matter of salvation. In the question of justification before God, all reliance on birth, and blood, and external morality, and forms of religion, and prayers, and alms, is to be renounced, and, in comparison with the merits of the great Redeemer, to be esteemed as vile. Such were Paul's views, and we may remark that if this was so in his case, it should he in ours. Such things can no more avail for our salvation than they could for his. We can no more be justified by them than he could. Nor will they do anything more in our case to commend us to God than they did in his. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8.

Those much conversant in Greek authors do criticise largely upon the word, which is acknowledged on all hands to import things, if not loathsome, yet vile and contemptible, as chaff, &c.; and so not absolutely, but in their respect, did Paul account all things in comparison of Christ, even our good works proceeding from a heart sanctified but in part; he doth not mean of the substance, but quality of the trust or merit placed in them; not in themselves, but in regard of confidence in them, as to pardon and acceptance with God: not in point of sanctification, but justification, the apostle is here speaking to.

Not only the things before mentioned, but anything, and everything else but Christ, or that stood in competition with him, or were short of him; as his natural and acquired parts; the whole compass of learning he had attained to; all that honour, credit, reputation, and popularity he was in for knowledge and devotion; all worldly substance, the comforts of life, and life itself; and all his righteousness since conversion, as well as before; of this no doubt could be made by those who knew him, his principles and his practices: and all this <p>for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: "by the knowledge of Christ" is not meant subjectively the knowledge that is in Christ, or which he has of others, either as God or man; but objectively, that knowledge which believers have of him, who know him not only in his person, as God over all, but as a Saviour and Redeemer, and as theirs; they know him in all his relations, and particularly as their Lord, not by creation only, but by redemption and grace, as the apostle did, putting an emphasis on these words, "my Lord"; thereby expressing his faith of interest in him, his great affection for him, and cheerful subjection to him. And this knowledge is not general, but special, spiritual, and saving; it is a knowledge of approbation of Christ above all others; a fiducial one, which has faith in him joined with it, and is both experimental and, practical, and, at least at times, appropriating; and though imperfect, it is progressive and capable of being increased, and will at last be brought to perfection. It is attained to, not by the light of nature, nor by the help of carnal reason, nor by the law of Moses, but by the Gospel of the grace of God, as a means; and the efficient cause of it is Father, Son, and Spirit; the Father reveals Christ in his saints; the Son gives them an understanding to know him; and the Spirit is a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; and this knowledge is very excellent: a spiritual knowledge of Christ is more excellent than a general and notional one, or than a knowledge of Christ after the flesh; and the knowledge of Christ under the Gospel dispensation, though the same in nature, is more excellent than that which was under the legal dispensation, by promises, prophecies, and the ceremonial law, in degree, extensiveness, and clearness; but the most excellent knowledge of Christ is that of the saints in heaven; yea, even there is an excellency in what the saints have here on earth, and a superior one to all other knowledge, if the author and original of it is considered: it is not of ourselves, nor by the assistance of men; it is not in the book of nature, nor in the schools of the philosophers; it is not of earth, nor earthly, but it comes from afar, from above, from heaven, from God the Father of lights; it is a free grace gift, a distinguishing one, and is very comprehensive, unspeakable, and unchangeable: and as to the object of it, it is Christ, the chiefest among ten thousands; who made the heavens, earth, and seas, and all that in them are, the sun, moon, and stars, men and beasts, birds and fishes, fossils, minerals, vegetables, and everything in nature; and therefore the knowledge of him must be superior to the knowledge of everything else; and, which adds to its excellency, it makes Christ precious, engages faith and confidence in him, influences the life and conversation, humbles the soul, and creates in it true pleasure and satisfaction; when all other knowledge fills with self-love, pride, and vanity, and increases sorrow; whereas this is not only useful in life, but supports, as under afflictions, so in the views of death and eternity; through it grace is received now, and by it glory hereafter; for it is the beginning, earnest, and pledge of eternal life. Well may the believer count all things but loss for it, as the apostle did; who adds, for further confirmation of what he had asserted, <p>for whom I have suffered the loss of all things; he dropped all confidence in his carnal privileges, and civil, ceremonial, and moral righteousness, for Christ and his righteousness; he parted with all for this pearl of great price; he lost his good name, credit, and reputation among men, and suffered afflictions and persecutions in various shapes; he lost the comforts of life, being often in cold and nakedness, in hunger and thirst, and was ready to suffer the loss of life itself for professing and preaching Christ: <p>and do count them but dung; or dog's meat; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm">Philippians 3:2</a>; what is fit only to be cast to dogs, as the word signifies; and intends every thing that is base, mean, and worthless; as the faeces of men, the dregs and lees of liquor, the falling of fruit, chaff, stubble, the dross of metals, dung, and what not: so he esteemed his carnal descent; his form and sect of religion, and zeal in it; his ceremonial and moral righteousness before and after conversion; and everything of the creature, or what was his own, and but flesh; being of the same opinion with the church of old, who reckoned her righteousnesses, the best, and the whole of them, as "filthy rags". The apostle next expresses his end and views in this, <p>that I may win Christ; not get an interest in him, for this he had already, and he knew he had, and that he should never lose it; and besides, an interest in Christ is not a thing that begins in time, but commenced from all eternity; and is not gotten at all, not by good works, nor repentance, nor faith; for these, if right and genuine, are the fruits and effects of an interest in Christ, but is what is freely given. The apostle's meaning is, either that he might gain or acquire a larger knowledge of Christ; and he cared not what pains he took, what expenses he was at, nor what loss he sustained for what he esteemed the most excellent, and for which he had already suffered the loss of all things; and if he had had more to lose, he could willingly part with it for more of this knowledge; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>; or his sense is, that he might gain by Christ, or that Christ might be gain to him, as he found him to be, and as he is to every believer; who by parting with all for Christ, gains much by him, as a justifying righteousness, acceptance with God, peace, pardon, life, grace, and glory. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yea doubtless, and I count <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> all things <i>but</i> loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them <i>but</i> dung, that I may <span class="cverse3">{f}</span> win Christ,</span><p>(e) He shuts out all works, those that go before, as well as those that come after faith.<p>(f) That in their place I might get Christ, and from a poor man become rich, so far am I from losing anything at all.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,">Php 3:8</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀλλά</span> is the climactic <span class="ital">but, still, much more</span>, giving a <span class="ital">corrective</span> reference of the sense, signifying that with the previous <span class="greekheb">ἅτινα</span> … <span class="greekheb">ζημίαν</span> there has not yet been enough said.

The <span class="greekheb">καί</span> before <span class="greekheb">ἡγοῦμαι</span> (after <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>) serves also to help the <span class="ital">climactic</span> sense, <span class="ital">outbidding</span> what has been said previously: <span class="ital">etiam</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">adeo</span>. It is consequently to be explained: <span class="ital">but, accordingly, I am even of opinion that everything</span> (not merely what was meant by <span class="greekheb">ἅτινα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.">Php 3:7</a>) <span class="ital">is a disadvantage</span>.

The explanation of others, according to which <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μὲν οὖν</span> is intended to oppose the <span class="ital">present</span> <span class="greekheb">ἡγοῦμαι</span> by way of correction to the <span class="ital">perfect</span> <span class="greekheb">ἥγημαι</span> (Calvin and others, including Winer, p. 412 [E.

The climactic contrast lies rather in the fact that the second <span class="greekheb">ἡγεῖσθαι ζημίαν</span> is a much <span class="ital">more comprehensive</span> one than the first, in fact, <span class="ital">one without exception</span> (<span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διὰ τὸ ὑπερέχον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] <span class="ital">on account of the surpassingness of the knowledge of Christ;</span> that is, because this knowledge, to which I have attained, is a possession which excels in value everything else; the eminent quality of a possession attained is the <span class="ital">ground</span> (<span class="greekheb">διά</span>) for estimating other possessions according to their relation to that one, and consequently, if they stand to the latter in a relation hindersome to us, for looking upon them no longer as something advantageous, but as hurtful.

Probably <span class="greekheb">γε</span> ought to be read (see crit. note <span class="ital">supr.</span>), as its absence in some good authorities is accounted for by the ease with which it could be omitted (so D omits it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-16.htm" title="I say again, Let no man think me a fool; if otherwise, yet as a fool receive me, that I may boast myself a little.">2 Corinthians 11:16</a>; [41]D[42]F[43]G in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm" title="He that spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how shall he not with him also freely give us all things?">Romans 8:32</a>; B in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-20.htm" title="No but, O man, who are you that reply against God?

Almost = “Nay, that is a feeble way of expressing it; I can go further and say,” etc. <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> suggests a contrast to be introduced, <span class="greekheb">μέν</span> adds emphasis, while <span class="greekheb">οὖν</span>, gathering up what has already been said, corrects it by way of extending his assertion (<span class="greekheb">γε</span> can scarcely be translated, representing, rather, a tone of the voice in taking back the limitations implied in <span class="greekheb">ἅτινα</span> … <span class="greekheb">κέρδη</span>). “Nay rather, I actually count <span class="ital">all</span> things,” etc. We cannot well see, in view of the natural translation of <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μενοῦνγε</span>, how the emphasis could be laid on any other word than <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>. There is no need for contrasting <span class="greekheb">ἥγημαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἡγοῦμαι</span>. He does not compare present and past. <span class="greekheb">ἥγημαι</span> already expresses the fixed decision to which he has come. He has spoken of regarding his important Jewish prerogatives as “loss” for Christ’s sake. Now he widens the range to <span class="greekheb">πάντα</span>. This is the goal of Christian life. It is not to be divided up between Christ and earthliness. It is not to express itself in attention to certain details. “If we should say <span class="ital">some</span> things, we might be in danger of sliding into a one-sided puritanism” (Rainy, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 191).—<span class="greekheb">τὸ ὑπερέχον τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γνώς</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. An instance of the extraordinary predilection of the later language for forming abstract substantives from adjectives and participles. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2 Corinthians 4:17</a>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐλαφρὸν τῆς θηίψεως ἡμῶν</span>. Probably = “the surpassing (or supreme) thing which consists in the knowledge,” etc. “We beheld His glory.” That glory outshines all this earth’s guiding-stars.—<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γνώσεως</span>. This knowledge on which Paul is so fond of dwelling is, as Beysch. well expresses it, “the reflection of faith in our reason” (<span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, ii., p. 177). It is directly connected with the surrender of the soul to Christ, but, as Paul teaches, that always means a close intimacy with Him, from which there springs an ever-growing knowledge of His spirit and will. Such knowledge lays a stable foundation for the Christian character, preventing it from evaporating into a mere unreasoning emotionalism. The conception, which is prominent in Paul’s writings, is based on the O.T. idea of the knowledge of God. That is always practical, religious. To know God is to revere Him, to be godly, for to know Him is to understand the revelation He has given of Himself. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm" title="And the spirit of the LORD shall rest on him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;">Isaiah 11:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-14.htm" title="For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.">Habakkuk 2:14</a>. It is natural that in the later Epistles this aspect of the spiritual life should come into the foreground, seeing that already the Christian faith was being confronted by other explanations of man’s relation to God. To know Christ, the Apostle teaches, is to have the key which will unlock all the secrets of existence viewed from the standpoint of religion.—<span class="greekheb">τοῦ Κυρίου μ</span>. It was as <span class="greekheb">Κύριος</span>, the exalted Lord, that Paul first knew Christ. And always it is from this standpoint he looks backwards and forwards. To recognise this is to understand his doctrinal teaching.—<span class="greekheb">διʼ ὃν τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πάντα ἐζημιώθην</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὰ πάντα</span> = “the sum-total” as opposed to a part. (So also Holst.) Perhaps in contrasting <span class="greekheb">ἐζημ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">κερδήσω</span>, as in the similar contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.">Php 3:7</a>, he may have in view our Lord’s words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm" title="For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul?">Matthew 16:26</a>. In N.T. only the passive of <span class="greekheb">ζημιόω</span> is used with various constructions. [It gives good sense to regard <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἡγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σκύβ</span>. as a parenthesis, and thus to make <span class="greekheb">ἵνα κερδ</span>. along with its parallel <span class="greekheb">τοῦ γνῶναι</span> depend on <span class="greekheb">ἐζημ</span>. In this case the Apostle speaks from the standpoint of his conversion. See J. Weiss, <span class="ital">Th. LZ</span>[44]., 1899, col. 264.]—<span class="greekheb">σκύβαλα</span>. The derivation is uncertain. It is most probably connected with <span class="greekheb">σκῶρ</span>, “dung”. It is often used in this sense itself, but also in the wider meaning of any “refuse,” such as the remains of a banquet. See a large collection of exx. from late writers in Wetstein and Lft[45]., and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the apt parallel in Plautus, <span class="ital">Truc.</span>, ii., 7, 5, <span class="ital">Amator qui bona sua pro stercore habet</span>. Probably <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span> ought to be omitted, although there is great divergence in the authorities. (See crit. note <span class="ital">supr.</span>) It might easily be inserted as parallel to the preceding <span class="greekheb">εἶναι</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κερδήσω</span>. “That I may win Christ.” There is nothing mechanical or fixed about fellowship with Christ. It may be interrupted by decay of zeal, the intrusion of the earthly spirit, the toleration of known sins, the easy domination of self-will, and countless other causes. Hence, to maintain it, there must be the continuous estimating of earthly things at their true value. Accordingly he looks on “winning Christ” as something present and future, not as a past act. (As to the form, an aorist <span class="greekheb">ἐκέρδησα</span> is found in Herod., Joseph., LXX, etc. See Kühner-Blass, <span class="ital">Gramm.</span>, ii., p. 457.)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[41] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[42] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.

The Apostle sometimes speaks with a certain depreciation of “knowledge” (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-2.htm" title="And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.">1 Corinthians 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-8.htm" title="Charity never fails: but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away.">1 Corinthians 13:8</a>). But he means there plainly a knowledge which is concerned not with Christ and God, but with spiritual curiosities, which may be known, or at least sought, without Divine life and love. The knowledge here in view is the recognition, from the first insight eternally onward, of the “knowledge-surpassing” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-19.htm" title="And to know the love of Christ, which passes knowledge, that you might be filled with all the fullness of God.">Ephesians 3:19</a>) reality and glory of the Person and Work of the Son of the Father, as Saviour, Lord, and Life; a knowledge inseparable from love. See further on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Php 3:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the implicit witness of such language as that before us to the Godhead of Christ.

The glorious Object shines anew before him as he thinks out the words. Observe too the characteristic “<span class="ital">my</span> Lord” (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-3.htm" title="I thank my God on every remembrance of you,">Php 1:3</a> above). There is a Divine <span class="ital">individualism</span> in the Gospel, in deep harmony with its truths of community and communion, but not to be merged in them. “One by one” is the law of the great ingathering and incorporation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-35.htm" title="And Jesus said to them, I am the bread of life: he that comes to me shall never hunger; and he that believes on me shall never thirst.">John 6:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-37.htm" title="All that the Father gives me shall come to me; and him that comes to me I will in no wise cast out.">John 6:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-40.htm" title="And this is the will of him that sent me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes on him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-44.htm" title="No man can come to me, except the Father which has sent me draw him: and I will raise him up at the last day.">John 6:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-47.htm" title="Truly, truly, I say to you, He that believes on me has everlasting life.">John 6:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-51.htm" title="I am the living bread which came down from heaven: if any man eat of this bread, he shall live for ever: and the bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.">John 6:51</a> &c.); the believing individual, as well as the believing Church, has Christ for “Head” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I would have you know, that the head of every man is Christ; and the head of the woman is the man; and the head of Christ is God.">1 Corinthians 11:3</a>), and lives by faith in Him who has loved the individual and given Himself for him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-25.htm" title="Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it;">Ephesians 5:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for whom</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">on account of whom</span>; in view of the discovery of whom.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have suffered</span> &c.] Better, <span class="bld">I suffered</span> &c.; a reference to the crisis of his renunciation of the old reliance, and also of the stern rejection with which the Synagogue would treat him as a renegade. This one passing allusion to the tremendous cost at which he became a Christian is, by its very passingness, deeply impressive and pathetic; and it has of course a powerful bearing on the nature and solidity of the reasons for his change, and so on the evidences of the Faith. See on this last subject, <span class="ital">Observations on the Character &c. of St Paul</span>, by George, first Lord Lyttelton (1747).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb rendered “<span class="ital">I suffered loss</span>,” “I was <span class="ital">fined, mulcted</span>,” is akin to the noun “<span class="ital">loss</span>” used just above, and takes it up. There is a certain verbal “play” in this; he reckoned his old privileges and position <span class="ital">loss</span>, from a spiritual point of view, and he was made by others to feel the <span class="ital">loss of them</span>, in a temporal respect.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all</span> things] The Gr. suggests the paraphrase, <span class="bld">my all</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">dung</span>] Better, <span class="bld">refuse</span>, as R.V. margin. The Greek word is used in secular writers in both senses. Its probably true derivation favours the former, but the derivation popularly accepted by the Greeks (“a thing <span class="ital">cast to the dogs</span>”) the latter. And this fact leans to the inference that in common parlance it meant the leavings of a meal, or the like. See Lightfoot here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that I may win</span>] Better, with R.V., <span class="bld">that I may gain</span>; the verb echoes the noun of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm" title="But what things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.">Php 3:7</a>. There was no <span class="ital">merit</span> in his coming to a true conviction about “confidence in the flesh”; but that conviction was so vital an antecedent to his possession and fruition of Christ that it was <span class="ital">as it were</span> the price paid in order to “gain” Him. Cp. the imagery of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/3-17.htm" title="Because you say, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of nothing; and know not that you are wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:...">Revelation 3:17-18</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“<span class="ital">That I may</span>”:—practically, we may paraphrase, “that I <span class="ital">might</span>”; with a reference to the <span class="ital">past</span>. The main bearing of the passage is obviously on the crisis of his conversion; on what he then lost and then gained, but he speaks as if he were in the crisis now. Not unfrequently in N.T. Greek the past is thus projected into the present and future, where certainly in English we should say “<span class="ital">might</span>,” not “<span class="ital">may</span>.” Cp. e.g. (in the Greek) <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-13.htm" title="Then were there brought to him little children, that he should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked them.">Matthew 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/5-26.htm" title="Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.">Acts 5:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-16.htm" title="However, for this cause I obtained mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all long-suffering, for a pattern to them which should hereafter believe on him to life everlasting.">1 Timothy 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1 John 3:5</a>. It is true that the Apostle here uses the present, not the past, in the adjoining main verb (“<span class="ital">I count</span>”). But this may well be an exceptional case of projection of the <span class="ital">whole</span> statement about the past, instead of part of it, into the present.—Or may not the words “<span class="ital">and do count them refuse</span>” be parenthetic? In that case he would in effect say, what would be a most vivid antithesis, “I suffered the <span class="ital">loss</span> of my all, (and a worthless ‘all’ <span class="ital">I now see it to be</span>,) that I might <span class="ital">gain</span> Christ.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He thus “gained” nothing less than Christ; not merely subsidiary and derived benefits, but the Source and Secret of all benefits.

Gataker says: “<span class="greekheb">σκύβαλον</span> marks out any worthless thing, that is to be cast away, such as the excrements of animals, the dregs and grounds of liquors, the dross of metals, what falls from plants, the refuse of the crops, the bran of meal, the crumbs of the table, the wipings of the hands, which are destined for the dogs.[40] See this very fully in Adversar. misc. posth. cap. 43.”—<span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span>, <span class="ital">that</span>) The two things are incompatible, both to retain other things and to win (obtain) Christ.—<span class="greekheb">κερδήσω καὶ εὑρεθῶ</span>, <span class="ital">that I may win and</span> he <span class="ital">found</span>) Each of the two is antithetical to <span class="greekheb">ζημίαν</span>, <span class="ital">loss</span>. He who loses all things, not even excepting himself, wins Christ, and is won in Christ. Christ is his, and he is Christ’s.

He holds fast the truth which he once learned; he still counts all things as loss in comparison with the one thing needful. The particles used here (see Winer, sect. liii.) correct and strengthen the assertion of the last verse, both as to time, "I count," and as to extent, "all things," not only the privileges mentioned above<span class="cmt_word">. For the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord</span>. The preposition may be rendered "for the sake of," as in ver. 7, or "because of." The knowledge of Christ is a blessing so surpassing and transcendent that nothing else is worthy to be called good in comparison with that one highest good. Its glory, like the rising sun, overwhelms and hides all lesser lights. <span class="accented">My Lord.</span> The pronoun expresses the warmth of his affection, the close personal communion between the apostle and the Savior (see ch. 1:3). <span class="cmt_word">For whom I have suffered the loss of all things</span>; rather, <span class="accented">I suffered the loss of</span>; literally, I was fined or <span class="accented">mulcted</span>; the aorist refers to the time of his conversion. <span class="accented">All things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span>); all that I had in the  world, my all, all things together (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-32.htm">Romans 8:32</a>).

There the Jews were the children, the Gentiles dogs. St. Paul here, as in ver. 2, reverses the terms of the comparison; the legal privileges of the Jew nee but as crumbs thrown to dogs in comparison with the rich blessings of the gospel. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-26.htm">Matthew 16:26</a>, where our Lord uses the same verbs, to lose and to gain; the whole world is but loss, the Savior says, compared with the never-dying soul. The loss of one's all in this world (St. Paul echoes the sacred words) is as nothing; all things put together are but as dung, compared with the one thing which St. Paul so longed to gain, Christ himself - his presence in the soul, spiritual union with the Lord. "To gain Christ is to lay fast hold upon him, to receive him inwardly into our bosoms, and so to make him ours and ourselves his, that we may be joined to him as our Head, espoused to him as our Husband, incorporated into him as our Nourishment, engrafted in him as our Stock, and laid upon him as a sure Foundation" (Bishop Hall, ' Christ Mystical,' ch. 6, quoted by Bishop EIlicott). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Yea doubtless (&#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>&#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; but, <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7</a>, puts that verse in direct contrast with the preceding verse. &#x391;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; yea or verily, in this verse affirms more than the preceding statement, while &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; therefore (not rendered), collects and concludes from what has been previously said: Yea verily therefore.<p>All things<p>An advance on those (things) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7</a>.<p>For the excellency, etc. (&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#768;)<p>On account of: because the knowledge of Christ is so much greater than all things else.<p>I have suffered the loss (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b6;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., better, I suffered; when I embraced Christianity.
