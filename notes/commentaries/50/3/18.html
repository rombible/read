The Judaising tenets were, indeed, in a true sense, an enmity to that cross, which was “to the Jews a stumbling-block,” because, as St. Paul shows at large in the Galatian and Roman Epistles, they trenched upon faith in the all-sufficient atonement, and so (as he expresses it with startling emphasis) made Christ to “be dead in vain.” But the doctrine of the Cross has two parts, distinct, yet inseparable. There is the cross which He alone bore for us, of which it is our comfort to know that we need only believe in it, and cannot share it. There is also the cross which we are “to take up and follow Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-38.htm" title="And he that takes not his cross, and follows after me, is not worthy of me.">Matthew 10:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/16-24.htm" title="Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.">Matthew 16:24</a>), in the “fellowship of His sufferings and conformity to His death,” described above (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10-11</a>). St. Paul unites both in the striking passage which closes his Galatian Epistle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-14.htm" title="But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.">Galatians 6:14</a>). He says, “God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of the Lord Jesus Christ!” but he adds, “whereby the world is crucified unto me, and I to the world.” Under cover, perhaps, of absolute acceptance of the one form of this great doctrine, the Antinomian party, “continuing in sin that grace might abound,” were, in respect of the other, “enemies of the cross of Christ.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For many walk - Many live, the Christian life being often in the Scriptures compared with a journey. In order to induce them to imitate those who were the most holy, the apostle says that there were many, even in the church, whom it would not be safe for them to imitate. He evidently here refers mainly to the church at Philippi, though it may be that he meant to make the declaration general, and to say that the same thing existed in other churches. There has not probably been any time yet in the Christian church when the same thing might not be said.<p>Of whom I have told you often - When he preached in Philippi. Paul was not afraid to speak of church members when they did wrong, and to warn others not to imitate their example. He did not attempt to cover up or excuse guilt because it was in the church, or to apologize for the defects and errors of those who professed to be Christians. The true way is, to admit that there are those in the church who do not honor their religion, and to warn others against following their example. But this fact does not make religion any the less true or valuable, anymore than the fact that there is counterfeit money makes all money bad, or makes genuine coin of no value.<p>And now tell you even weeping - This is the true spirit with which to speak of the errors and faults of Christians. It is not to go and blazon their inconsistencies abroad. It is not to find pleasure in the fact that they are inconsistent. It is not to reproach religion on that account, and to say that all religion is false and hollow, and that all professors are hypocrites. We should rather speak of the fact with tears; for, if there is anything that should make us weep, it is, that there are those in the church who are hypocrites, or who dishonor their profession. We should weep:<p>(1) because they are in danger of destroying their own souls;<p>(2) because they are destined to certain disappointment when they come to appear before God; and,<p>(3) because they injure the cause of religion, and give occasion to the "enemies of the Lord to speak reproachfully." He who loves religion. will weep over the inconsistencies of its friends; he who does not, will exult and triumph.<p>That they are the enemies of the cross of Christ - The "cross" was the instrument of death on which the Redeemer died to make atonement for sin. As the atonement made by Christ for sin is that which especially distinguishes his religion from all others, the "cross" comes to be used to denote his religion; and the phrase here means, that they were the enemies of his religion, or were strangers to the gospel. It is not to be supposed that they were open and avowed enemies of the cross, or that they denied that the Lord Jesus died on the cross to make an atonement. The characteristic of those persons mentioned in the following verse is, rather, that they were living in a manner which showed that they were strangers to his pure gospel. An immoral life is enmity to the cross of Christ; for he died to make us holy. A life where there is no evidence that the heart is renewed, is enmity to the cross; for he died that we might be renewed. They are the enemies of the cross, in the church:<p>(1) who have never been born again;<p>(2) who are living in the indulgence of known sin;<p>(3) who manifest none of the peculiarities of those who truly love him;<p>(4) who have a deeper interest in worldly affairs than they have in the cause of the Redeemer;<p>(5) whom nothing can induce to give up their worldly concerns when God demands it;<p>(6) who are opposed to all the unique doctrines of Christianity; and,<p>(7) who are opposed to all the special duties of religion, or who live in the habitual neglect of them.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. many walk&#8212;in such a manner.

"otherwise", as the Syriac version adds; and which truly explains the words, and gives the sense; they walked not as the apostle and his followers; they walked as men, as carnal men, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>, according to the course of the world, after their ungodly lusts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>; or according to the rites and ceremonies of the Mosaic dispensation, and not uprightly, and according to the truth of the Gospel: and there were many that walked so; the road both of profaneness and error is a broad one, and many walk therein, which makes it the more dangerous; the examples of many have great force, though a multitude is not to be followed to do evil; the conversation of a great part of professors is not to be imitated; the few names in Sardis that have not defiled their garments with error or immorality should be marked for ensamples, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/3-4.htm">Revelation 3:4</a>, and the majority shunned: <p>of whom I have told you often; both when present among them by word of mouth, and when absent from them by writing; for the apostle was a faithful watchman and monitor to this church, and to all the churches, the care of which lay upon him; and diligent he was to warn them against false teachers, whose doctrines and practices he knew were of pernicious consequence: <p>and now tell you even weeping; partly on account of those evil men, whose state and condition, notwithstanding their profession, was very bad; and partly on account of the glory of God and Christ, and the honour of religion, which suffered much through them; and also on account of the Philippians, lest they should be drawn aside by them; and because they had taken so little notice of his frequent cautions and advice: and that they might the better know the men he spoke of, and avoid them, he describes them by the following characters, <p>that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ; not that, though they might be Jews, they were like the unbelieving Jews, who were open and implacable enemies of a crucified Christ, called Jesus accursed, and anathematized him and his followers, and to whom the preaching of Christ crucified was an offence and stumblingblock, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; for these were professors of Christ, and pretended to preach Christ, and him crucified: nor were they such heretics that denied that Christ really assumed human nature, and was really crucified and died; and affirmed that all this was only in appearance, or that an image was hung upon the cross for him, or Simon the Cyrenian was crucified in his room, as some have thought, which was the heresy of Simon Magus, and his disciple Basilides: nor is the sense that they were averse to the crucifixion of the affections with the lusts, though this seems to be their true character, since they were sensual, and minded earthly things; but the meaning is, that they disliked the cross of Christ; they were unwilling to take it up for his sake, and follow him; they studied all ways and means to shun it; they ingratiated themselves into the affections of the unbelieving Jews, by complying with the ceremonies of the law, and bearing hard upon the apostle and his ministry, that so they might not suffer persecution for the cross of Christ; and besides, by enjoining circumcision and an observance of the law as necessary to salvation, they, as much as in them lay, made void the efficacy of the cross and death of Christ, and made that and him unprofitable, and of no effect to the souls of men; and were both doctrinally and practically enemies of the cross of Christ: and so all such professors of Christ, who walk not according to the Gospel, though they are not open and direct enemies to the Gospel, which is the preaching of the cross, yet they are secret and indirect ones, and oftentimes do more mischief to it by their lives, than the keenest adversaries of it can by their pens. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> (For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, <i>that they are</i> the enemies of the cross of Christ:</span><p>(8) He shows what the false apostles truly are, not from malice or ambition, but with sorrow and tears, that is, because being enemies of the Gospel (for that is joined with persecuting it) they regard nothing else, but the benefits of this life: that is to say, that abounding in peace, and quietness, and all worldly pleasures, they may live in great estimation among men, whose miserable end he forewarned them of.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a>.

Erasmus (see his <span class="ital">Annot</span>.) and others, including Rheinwald, van Hengel, Rilliet, de Wette, Wiesinger, and Weiss, consider the discourse as broken off, the introduction of the relative clauses inducing the writer to leave out the modal definition of <span class="greekheb">περιπ</span>.

Hec</span>. 771; Kühner, II. 2, p. 925; Buttm. <span class="ital">Neut. Gr</span>. p. 68 [E.

Hoelemann, de Wette, Lünemann, Wiesinger, Schenkel, and Hofmann have justly pronounced against the identity of the two; Weiss, however, following out his wrong interpretation of <span class="greekheb">κύνες</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-2.htm" title="Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision.">Php 3:2</a> (of the <span class="ital">heathen</span>), maintains the identity to a certain extent by assuming that the conduct of those <span class="greekheb">κύνες</span> is here described; while Baur makes use of the passage to deny freshness, naturalness, and objectivity to the polemic attack here made on the false teachers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] Hence also the conjecture of Laurent (<span class="ital">Neut. Stud.</span> p. 21 f.), that <span class="greekheb">οἳς πολλάκις</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀπώλεια</span> is a <span class="ital">supplementary marginal note</span> inserted by the apostle, is unwarranted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philippians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-18.htm" title="(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are the enemies of the cross of Christ:">Php 3:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. To whom does he refer? Plainly they were persons inside the Christian Church, although probably not at Philippi. This (against Ws[1].) is borne out by the use of <span class="greekheb">περιπατεῖν</span> compared with <span class="greekheb">περιπατοῦντας</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>) and <span class="greekheb">στοιχεῖν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-16.htm" title="Nevertheless, whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same rule, let us mind the same thing.">Php 3:16</a>), by <span class="greekheb">κλαίων</span> which would have no meaning here if not applied to professing Christians, and further by <span class="greekheb">ἐχθρούς</span> which would be a mere platitude if used of heathens or Jews. Some (<span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Schinz, Hort, Cone, etc.) refer this passage to the same persons as he denounces at the beginning of the chapter, the Judaising teachers. And no doubt they might fitly be called <span class="greekheb">ἐχθροὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ</span> (<span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/6-12.htm" title="As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they constrain you to be circumcised; only lest they should suffer persecution for the cross of Christ....">Galatians 6:12-14</a>). But the rest of the description applies far more aptly to professing Christians who allowed their liberty to degenerate into licence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-13.htm" title="For, brothers, you have been called to liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.">Galatians 5:13</a>); who, from an altogether superficial view of grace, thought lightly of continuing in sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/6-12.htm" title="Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in the lusts thereof....">Romans 6:12-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-15.htm" title="What then? shall we sin, because we are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid.">Romans 6:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-23.htm" title="For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.">Romans 6:23</a>); who, while bearing the name of Christ, were concerned only with their own self-indulgence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a>). If there did exist at Philippi any section disposed to look with favour on Judaising tendencies, this might lead others to exaggerate the opposite way of thinking and to become a ready prey to Antinomian reaction. Possibly passages like the present and <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-18.htm" title="For they that are such serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple.">Romans 16:18</a> point to the earliest beginnings of that strange medley of doctrines which afterwards developed into Gnosticism. That this is the more natural explanation seems also to follow from the context. The Apostle has had in view, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-11.htm" title="If by any means I might attain to the resurrection of the dead.">Php 3:11</a> onwards, the advance towards perfection, the point already attained, the kind of course to be imitated. It seems most fitting that he should warn against those who pretended to be on the straight path, but who were really straying on devious by-ways of their own.—<span class="greekheb">οὓς πολλάκις ἔλεγον κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. “Whom I often used to call,” etc. (so also Grotius, Heinrichs, Hfm[2].). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Æsch., <span class="ital">Eumen.</span>, 48, <span class="greekheb">οὔτοι γυναῖκας ἀλλὰ Γοργόνας λέγω</span>. Hatz. (<span class="ital">Einl.</span>, p. 223) remarks that in the Greek islands they say <span class="greekheb">μὲ λέγει</span> or <span class="greekheb">λέγει με</span> = “he names me”. Paul speaks with a depth and vehemence of feeling (<span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">πολλάκις</span> … <span class="greekheb">κλαίων</span>) which suggest his genuine interest in those disloyal Christians who had once seemed to receive his message. If we imagine that the terms he uses are too strong to apply to professing Christians, we must remember that he speaks in a most solemn mood and from the highest point of view.—<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐχθροὺς τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">στ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. If we are right in taking <span class="greekheb">λέγω</span> = “call,” “name,” <span class="greekheb">τοὺς ἐχθ</span>. will come in as the remoter accusative. Otherwise it must be regarded as assimilated to the relative clause, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-25.htm" title="And this is the promise that he has promised us, even eternal life.">1 John 2:25</a>. The true Christian is the man who is “crucified with Christ,” who has “crucified the flesh with its affections and lusts”. The Cross is the central principle in his life. “If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.” Those here described, by their unthinking self-indulgence, run directly in the teeth of this principle. The same thing holds good of much that passes for Christianity in modern life. “Who has not known kindly, serviceable men hanging about the Churches with a real predilection for the suburban life of Zion … and yet men whose life just seemed to omit the Cross of Christ” (Rainy, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 286). It is quite probable that Paul would feel their conduct all the more keenly inasmuch as Judaisers might point to it as the logical consequence of his liberal principles.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] .

That there were such in the primeval Church appears also from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/16-17.htm" title="Now I beseech you, brothers, mark them which cause divisions and offenses contrary to the doctrine which you have learned; and avoid them....">Romans 16:17-18</a> (a warning <span class="ital">to</span> Rome, as this <span class="ital">from</span> Rome); <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-6.htm" title="Your glorying is not good.

Such growths of error, at once subtle and outrageous, appear to characterize, as by a mysterious law, every great period of spiritual advance and illumination. Compare the phenomena (cent. 16) of the Libertines at Geneva and the Prophets of Zwickau in Germany. Indeed few periods of Christian history have escaped such trials.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The false teachers in view here were no doubt broadly divided from the Judaists, and in most cases honestly and keenly opposed to them. But it is quite possible that in some cases the “the extremes met” in such a way as to account for the mention here of both in one context, in this chapter. The sternest formal legalism has a fatal tendency to slight “the weightier matters of the law,” and heart-purity among them; and history has shewn cases in which it has tolerated a social libertinism of the worst kind, irrevocably condemned by the true Gospel of free grace. Still, the persons referred to in this section were those who positively “<span class="ital">gloried</span> in their shame”; and this points to an avowed and dogmatic antinomianism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The “<span class="ital">many</span>” of this verse is an instructive reminder of the formidable <span class="ital">internal difficulties</span> of the apostolic Church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I have told you</span>] Lit. and better, <span class="bld">I used to tell you</span>, in the old days of personal intercourse.

He seems to be speaking here, not of the Jews, but of nominal Christians, who used their liberty for a cloke of licentiousness.
