It is a righteousness resulting from the works of the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>), earned by an obedience to the Law, which is “mine own”—“not of grace, but of debt” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-4.htm" title="Now to him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt.">Romans 4:4</a>)—such as St. Paul declares (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3-6</a>) to have been blindly sought by Israel, which he there defines as “life by doing the things of the Law.” We have here, and in the following words, a remarkable link of connection with the earlier Epistles of the Judaising controversy, corresponding to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>, but cast more nearly in the ancient mould. Yet it is, after all, only the last echo of the old controversy, which we trace so clearly in the Galatian and Roman Epistles. The battle is now virtually won, and it only needs to complete the victory.<p><span class= "bld">But . . . the righteousness which is of God by</span> (<span class= "ital">on condition of</span>) <span class= "bld">faith.</span>—This verse is notable, as describing the true righteousness; first imperfectly, as coming “through faith of Jesus Christ,” a description which discloses to us only its means, and not its origin; next, completely, as “a righteousness coming from God on the sole condition of faith”—faith being here viewed not as the means, but as the condition, of receiving the divine gift (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>). It may be noted that in the Epistle to the Romans, we have righteousness “through faith,” “from faith,” “of faith;” for there it was needful to bring out in various forms the importance of faith. Here, now that the urgent necessity has passed, we have the stress laid simply on the opposition of the gift of God through Christ to the merit of the works of the Law; and faith occupies a less prominent, though not less indispensable, position. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>, and Note thereon.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-11 Sincere Christians rejoice in Christ Jesus. The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And be found in him - That is, united to him by a living faith. The idea is, that when the investigations of the great day should take place in regard to the ground of salvation, it might be found that he was united to the Redeemer and depended solely on his merits for salvation; compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-56.htm">John 6:56</a>.<p>Not having mine own righteousness - That is, not relying on that for salvation. This was now the great aim of Paul, that it might be found at last that he was not trusting to his own merits, but to those of the Lord Jesus.<p>Which is of the law - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm">Romans 10:3</a>. The "righteousness which is of the law" is that which could be obtained by conformity to the precepts of the Jewish religion, such as Paul had endeavored to obtain before he became a Christian. He now saw that no one complied perfectly with the holy law of God, and that all dependence on such a righteousness was vain. All people by nature seek salvation by the law. They set up some standard which they mean to comply with, and expect to be saved by conformity to that. With some it is the law of honor, with others the law of honesty, with others the law of kindness and courtesy, and with others the law of God. If they comply with the requirements of these laws, they suppose that they will be safe, and it is only the grace of God showing them how defective their standard is, or how far they come from complying with its demands, that can ever bring them from this dangerous dependence. Paul in early life depended on his compliance with the laws of God as he understood them, and supposed that he was safe. When he was brought to realize his true condition, he saw how far short he had come of what the law of God required, and that all dependence on his own works was vain.<p>But that which is through the faith of Christ - That justification which is obtained by believing on the Lord Jesus Christ; see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm">Romans 1:17</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-24.htm">Romans 3:24</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>, note.<p>Righteousness which is of God by faith - Which proceeds from God, or of which he is the great source and fountain. This may include the following things:<p>(1) God is the author of pardon - and this is a part of the righteousness which the man who is justified has.<p>(2) God purposes to treat the justified sinner as if he had not sinned - and thus his righteousness is of God.<p>(3) God is the source of all the grace that will be imparted to the soul, making it really holy. In this way, all the righteousness which the Christian has is "of God." The idea of Paul is, that he now saw that it was far more desirable to be saved by righteousness obtained from God than by his own. That obtained from God was perfect, and glorious, and sufficient; that which he had attempted to work out was defective, impure, and wholly insufficient to save the soul. It is far more honorable to be saved by God than to save ourselves; it is more glorious to depend on him than to depend on anything that we can do. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. be found in him&#8212;"be found" at His coming again, living spiritually "in Him" as the element of my life.

"Of," that is, from.<p>righteousness &#8230; of God by faith&#8212;Greek, "which is from God (resting) upon faith." Paul was transported from legal bondage into Christian freedom at once, and without any gradual transition. Hence, the bands of Pharisaism were loosed instantaneously; and opposition to Pharisaic Judaism took the place of opposition to the Gospel. Thus God's providence fitly prepared him for the work of overthrowing all idea of legal justification. "The righteousness of faith," in Paul's sense, is the righteousness or perfect holiness of Christ appropriated by faith, as the objective ground of confidence for the believer, and also as a new subjective principle of life. Hence it includes the essence of a new disposition, and may easily pass into the idea of sanctification, though the two ideas are originally distinct. It is not any arbitrary act of God, as if he treated as sinless a man persisting in sin, simply because he believes in Christ; but the objective on the part of God corresponds to the subjective on the part of man, namely, faith. The realization of the archetype of holiness through Christ contains the pledge that this shall be realized in all who are one with Him by faith, and are become the organs of His Spirit. Its germ is imparted to them in believing although the fruit of a life perfectly conformed to the Redeemer, can only be gradually developed in this life [Neander].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And be found in him; </span> a learned interpreter reads it actively, and may find, or recover, in him, all my losses.

Calvin, different from other interpreters, reads the words actively, "and may find in him"; and thinks the sense is, that the apostle renounced all things for Christ, that he might recover all in him: and true it is, that for the loss of carnal privileges, he found in Christ spiritual blessings; and for the loss of his own righteousness, another, and a better, even the righteousness of God; and in lieu of external goods, or worldly substance he was stripped of, true and lasting riches; and in the room of outward credit, peace and plenty, true honour, real peace, and spiritual pasture; and instead of the comforts of life, and life itself, spiritual and eternal life; though it is best to read the words passively, "and be found in him"; that is, "be in him", as the Ethiopic version renders it; so the word found is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm">Galatians 2:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-8.htm">Philippians 2:8</a>; and he means not a nominal being in Christ, or a being in him by profession, but a real one; and watch is either secret or open: a secret being in Christ he had from everlasting, being chosen in him, given to him, loved by him, betrothed unto him, preserved in him, and represented by him; and an open one he had at conversion, when he became a new creature, and was created in Christ Jesus unto good works: and here he intends a more clear and evident manifestation of his being in Christ; and his desire is, that he might appear to be in him, in life and at death, and at the day of judgment, and in the following manner: <p>not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law; by which he means his obedience to the moral, as well as the ceremonial law; for the one was as much his own as the other, and more properly his righteousness: this he calls his "own", because performed by him, and wrought out in his own strength; and which he had an high opinion of, as if it was perfect and blameless; and which he had before put his trust and confidence in; as also to distinguish it from another's righteousness, even that which he had in Christ: he moreover calls it, "the righteousness which is of the law"; which the law required, and he performed in obedience to it, seeking for justification by it; this character distinguishes it from the righteousness of God, which is revealed in the Gospel, and is manifested without the law: and this his own legal righteousness he did not desire to "have", and to be found in; not but that he desired to live soberly and righteously, to have, and do works of righteousness, but not depend on them; he would not have, and account this his moral righteousness, as a justifying one; he knew it was imperfect, filthy, and unprofitable, and that by it he could not be justified and saved, therefore he desired to have another, <p>But that which is through the faith of Christ; not through that faith which Christ himself, as man, had and exercised on God, as his God; but that which he is the author and finisher of, and which has him and his righteousness for its object; not through faith, as the cause of it; for the moving cause of justification is the free grace of God, and the efficient cause is God himself: and it appears from hence, that faith is not the matter of our justification, or is not our righteousness; for faith and righteousness are two distinct things, otherwise righteousness could not be said to be "through" faith. The righteousness of Christ is here meant, and which is the sole matter of justification, and comes to us through faith apprehending, receiving, and embracing it; and which shows, that it must be before faith, or it could not be through it; as water that runs through a bridge must be before and after that bridge through which it runs. This righteousness is further described, as <p>the righteousness which is of God by faith; that righteousness which Christ, who is the true God, is the author of, hence it is a pure and perfect one, infinite, and serves for many; which God the Father approves of, and is well pleased with, because his law is magnified, and made honourable by it; and what he graciously gives, and freely imputes without works, to his people: and this is "by faith", which beholds the excellency of it, acknowledges its sufficiency, renounces its own righteousness, and submits to, and lays hold on this, and rejoices in it; and thus men are justified openly and manifestly by faith, receiving the justifying righteousness of Christ: or the words may be rendered "upon faith". This righteousness is as a garment put upon faith, or put upon him by God, who has true faith in Christ; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>. This last clause, "by faith", is omitted in the Syriac and Ethiopic versions, and seems to be read by them as belonging to the beginning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>. Now this righteousness the apostle desired to have, and be found in; and this he says not, as supposing that a person may be found in Christ, and yet not have his righteousness; nor as if he himself had not this righteousness, and an interest in it; but to show his value for it, and his desire to be continually exercising faith on it, and the trust and confidence he placed in it; well knowing that in this he was safe and secure from all condemnation; this would answer for him in a time to come; being found in this he should not be naked nor speechless, and should have a right and an admission into the kingdom and glory of Christ Jesus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And be found in <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> him, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> not having mine own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:</span><p>(g) In Christ: for those that are found outside of Christ are subject to condemnation.<p>(h) That is, to be in Christ, to be found not in a man's own righteousness, but clothed with the righteousness of Christ imputed to him.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καὶ εὑρεθῶ ἐν αὐτῷ</span>] <span class="ital">and to be found in Him</span>.

The repetition of <span class="greekheb">ἔχων</span> after <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">πίστει</span>, which Hofmann feels the want of in this explanation, would be simply superfluous and clumsy. <span class="greekheb">Ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>. is usually attached to <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνην</span> (“justitiam superstructam fidei,” Hoelemann, Wiesinger), some having taken <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> as “<span class="ital">in</span> fide” (Vulgate, Calvin), or <span class="ital">in fide sitam</span> (Castalio); others as “<span class="ital">per</span> fidem” (Beza, Grotius); others, <span class="ital">for the sake</span> of faith (de Wette); others, <span class="ital">upon the condition</span> of faith (Storr, Flatt, Matthies, Rilliet, van Hengel, J. B. Lightfoot). But it may be urged against this connection, first, that, in accordance with the previous definitions, we could not but expect the repetition of the article; secondly, that <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> nowhere occurs in the N. T.; and lastly, that <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> in its quality as righteousness <span class="ital">of faith</span> was already distinctly designated by <span class="greekheb">τὴν διὰ πίστ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>., so that the same attribute of it would be expressed <span class="ital">twice</span>, and, on the other hand, the <span class="greekheb">ἔχων</span> which is to be repeated after <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span> (the basis of which is still <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">π</span>.) would be <span class="ital">without</span> any more precise definition.

The central fact of Paul’s religious life and thought, the complete identification of the believer with Christ.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔχων</span>. <span class="greekheb">μή</span> either depends directly on <span class="greekheb">ἵνα</span> or is used to express Paul’s own view of what is implied in <span class="greekheb">εὑρεθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν α</span>. This last thought must be regarded as the basis on which the clauses immediately following rest.—<span class="greekheb">ἐμὴν δικ</span>. “A righteousness of my own.” <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <span class="ital">Apoc. of Bar.</span>, lxiii. 3 “then Hezekiah trusted in his works and had hope in his righteousness”. The noun <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. is anarthrous to emphasise the idea belonging to it in its essential force. <span class="greekheb">ἐμήν</span> is added to define, and then the definition is elaborated by the clause with the article. An instructive parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">ἐν πίστει ζῶ τῇ τοῦ υἱοῦ τοῦ θεοῦ</span> (see an important note in Green, <span class="ital">Gram. of N.T.</span>, pp. 34–35). <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, as usually in Paul’s writings, means a <span class="ital">right relation</span> between him and God. The retention of the word by Paul to denote the position of the Christian before God is, as Holst. (<span class="ital">Paulin. Theol.</span>, p. 64) points out, a proof of his close connexion with the Jewish consciousness. We may call it a “forensic” word, for certainly there always lies behind it the idea of a standard appointed by God, a law, the expression of the Divine will. The qualifying words here show what Paul has in view.—<span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκ νόμου</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the lament for the destruction of Jerusalem in <span class="ital">Apoc. of Bar.</span>, lxvii. 6, “the vapour of the smoke of the incense of righteousness which is by the law is extinguished in Zion” (and see Charles’ note on xv. 5). This hypothetical <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>., which he calls his own, could only spring from complete conformity to the will of God as revealed in precepts and commands. That is the kind of relation to God which Paul has found to be impossible. On <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> without the article see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-5.htm" title="Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;">Php 3:5</a> <span class="ital">supr.</span> <span class="greekheb">τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χ</span>., <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐκ Θεοῦ δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ πίστει</span>. The exact character of this <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> which Paul prizes must be carefully noted. The presupposition of possessing it is “to be found in Christ”. It is not a righteousness which he can win by legal observances. It springs from God. What does this new relation to God precisely mean? The one condition of understanding the Apostle’s language is to remember that he combines in his thinking two conceptions of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>, or perhaps we should rather say that his own experience has made vivid for him a two-sided conception of this relation. On the one hand, he thinks of <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. as connected with God, the Judge of men. God, strictly marking sin, might condemn men absolutely, because all have sinned. Instead of that, because of His grace manifested in Jesus Christ the crucified and working through Christ’s death, He deals mercifully with sinners, <span class="ital">treats them as righteous on account of the propitiation made by the Righteous One</span>, treats them as standing in a right relation to Himself, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, pardons them. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> thus comes to be God’s gracious way of dealing with us, “forgiveness with the Forgiver in it” (Rainy, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, p. 231), the relation with God into which we are brought by His grace for Jesus’ sake, regarded more or less as an activity of His, practically = salvation (which, already in O.T., rested upon the rectitude of God’s character, see, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/51-5.htm" title="My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and my arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait on me, and on my arm shall they trust....">Isaiah 51:5-8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/98-2.htm" title="The LORD has made known his salvation: his righteousness has he openly showed in the sight of the heathen.">Psalm 98:2</a>). God’s justifying of us makes us <span class="greekheb">δίκαιοι</span> in His sight: we possess <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span>. That, however, might appear arbitrary. But the Apostle gives no ground for such a suspicion. This <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἐκ Θεοῦ</span> is only reached “through the faith of Christ,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, the faith which Christ kindles, of which He is the author, which, also, He nourishes and maintains (see esp[46]. Haussleiter, <span class="ital">Greifswald. Studien</span>, pp. 177–178). This <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. is securely founded on faith in Christ (<span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τῇ π</span>.). But what does such faith effect? It is that which makes the believer one with Christ. He shares in all that his Lord possesses. Christ imparts life to him. Christ’s relation to the Father becomes his. But this is no longer a being regarded or dealt with by God as if he were <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>. Union with Christ makes it possible for the Christian to <span class="ital">be</span> <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, to show himself such in actual behaviour. Thus <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> may express something more than the relation to God into which believers are brought by God’s justifying judgment (which for their experience means the sense of forgiveness with the Forgiver in it). It embraces the conduct which is the response to that forgiving love of God, a love only bestowed on the soul united to Christ by faith (see esp[47]. Pfieid., <span class="ital">Paulin.</span>, i., p. 175; Hltzm[48]., <span class="ital">N.T. Th.</span>, ii., pp. 127–129, 138–139; Häring, <span class="greekheb">Δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> <span class="ital">bei Paulus</span>, Tübingen, 1896; Kölbing, <span class="ital">SK</span>[49]., 1895, 7 ff.; Denney, <span class="ital">Expos.</span>, vi., 3, p. 433 ff., 4, p. 299 ff., Holst., <span class="ital">Paulin.

The truth of the believer’s deep incorporation in his Lord and Head, and identification with Him for acceptance and life, is here full in view. In the surrender of faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:...">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/3-36.htm" title="He that believes on the Son has everlasting life: and he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God stays on him.">John 3:36</a>) he becomes, in the deep laws of spiritual life, a true “limb” of the sacred Head; interested in His merits, penetrated with His exalted Life. In the Epistles to Colossæ and Ephesus, written from the same chamber as this, we have the large development of this truth; and cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/15-1.htm" title="I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer....">John 15:1-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-12.htm" title="For as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.">1 Corinthians 12:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot remarks (on <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-17.htm" title="But if, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we ourselves also are found sinners, is therefore Christ the minister of sin?

(See Grimm’s Greek-Eng. Lexicon of the N.T., Thayer’s edition, on the word δικαιοσύνη, for a good statement of the matter from the purely critical point of view.) “A righteousness of mine own” is thus a title to acceptance, a claim on Divine justice, due to my own doings and merits, supposed to satisfy a legal standard.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">which is of the law</span>] Literally, again “<span class="ital">of law</span>.” But R.V. retains the definite article, as practically right in translation, as it was in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Php 3:6</a>.—How shall we define the word “<span class="ital">Law</span>” here? Is it the Mosaic law from the Pharisee’s point of view, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-6.htm" title="Concerning zeal, persecuting the church; touching the righteousness which is in the law, blameless.">Php 3:6</a>? Or is it the far larger fact of the Divine preceptive moral code, taken as a covenant of life, in which the terms are, “Do this, truly and perfectly, and live; do this, and claim acceptance as of right”? We take the answer to be that it means here this latter as an extension of the former; that the thought rises, or developes itself, in this passage, from the idea of special ordinance to the idea of universal covenanting precept. And our reasons lie, partly in this context, partly in the great parallel passages in the Epistles to the Romans, Galatians, Ephesians and Colossians. In the present context the ideas immediately contrasted or opposed to that of “the law” are ideas not of “work,” in any meaning of that word, but of “faith.” And for exposition of this we turn to the argument of Romans 1-5, and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-3.htm" title="But neither Titus, who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:">Galatians 2:3</a>, and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-1.htm" title="And you has he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins;...">Ephesians 2:1-10</a>, and (a passage closely parallel to this; see notes in this Series) 13–17; and of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ....">Colossians 2:8-14</a>. In this whole range of teaching it is apparent that the idea of Law, as a whole, cannot possibly be satisfied by explaining it to mean merely a Divine code of observances, though that is one of its lower and subsidiary meanings. It means the whole system of Divine precept, moral as well as ceremonial, eternal as well as temporal, <span class="ital">taken as a covenant to be fulfilled in order to acceptance</span> of the person before God. The implicit or explicit <span class="ital">contrary</span> is that such acceptance is procured for us by the merits of the Redeeming Lord, appropriated to the sinner by the single profound means of faith, that is to say, acceptance of Him as Sacrifice, Saviour, Lord, on the warrant of God’s word. Such faith, in the spiritual order of things, unites to Christ, and in that union the “member” receives the merit of the “Head” for his acceptance, and the life and power of the Head for obedience. That obedience (see esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/2-8.htm" title="For by grace are you saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:...">Ephesians 2:8-10</a>) is now rendered not in fulfilment of a covenant for acceptance, but in the life, and for the love, given to the believer under the covenant in which he is accepted, from first to last, for the sake of his meritorious Lord and Head. Cp. further, Hebrews 10, esp. 15–18; with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/31-33.htm" title="But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, said the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people....">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such is the general Pauline doctrine of acceptance, a doctrine such as to give its opponents or perverters, from the very first, a superficial excuse to make it out to be <span class="ital">antinomian</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-8.htm" title="And not rather, (as we be slanderously reported, and as some affirm that we say,) Let us do evil, that good may come? whose damnation is just.">Romans 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-1.htm" title="What shall we say then? Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>); a fact of the utmost weight in the estimate of its true bearing.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such a general doctrine assists us in interpreting this great incidental passage. And we infer here accordingly that the primary idea is that of acceptance <span class="ital">for Christ’s sake</span>, as against acceptance on the score of any sort of personal merit. The spiritual development of the regenerate being comes in nobly here, as in the other and larger passages referred to; but it comes in upon the basis, and as the sequel, of a gratuitous acceptance for Christ’s sake alone. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Php 3:10</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that which is through the faith of Christ</span>] So lit., but better, in regard of English idiom, <span class="bld">that which is through faith in Christ</span>. For the Greek construction (“<span class="ital">faith of</span>,” meaning “<span class="ital">faith in</span>”) cp. e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/11-22.htm" title="And Jesus answering said to them, Have faith in God.">Mark 11:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-16.htm" title="And his name through faith in his name has made this man strong, whom you see and know: yes, the faith which is by him has given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.">Acts 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-20.htm" title="I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ lives in me: and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.">Galatians 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-12.htm" title="In whom we have boldness and access with confidence by the faith of him.">Ephesians 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm" title="But we are bound to give thanks always to God for you, brothers beloved of the Lord, because God has from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>. Here again, as with the words “law” and “righteousness,” St Paul’s writings are a full commentary. See especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/3-22.htm" title="Even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ to all and on all them that believe: for there is no difference:...">Romans 3:22-28</a>, a passage most important as a parallel here. It brings out the fact that “faith,” in the case in question, has special regard to Christ as the shedder of His sacred blood in propitiation, and that the blessing immediately received by faith thus acting is the acceptance, the justification, of the sinner before the holy Lawgiver and Judge, solely for the Propitiator’s sake. See further Romans 4, 5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/8-33.htm" title="Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifies....">Romans 8:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-33.htm" title="As it is written, Behold, I lay in Sion a stumbling stone and rock of offense: and whoever believes on him shall not be ashamed.">Romans 9:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/10-9.htm" title="That if you shall confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and shall believe in your heart that God has raised him from the dead, you shall be saved....">Romans 10:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-16.htm" title="Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the law: for by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.">Galatians 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-1.htm" title="O foolish Galatians, who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ has been evidently set forth, crucified among you?...">Galatians 3:1-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/galatians/3-21.htm" title="Is the law then against the promises of God?

It may suffice to point out that at least the leading and characteristic idea of the word is <span class="ital">personal trust</span>, not of course without grounds, but on grounds other than “sight.” It is certainly not mere assent to testimony, a mental act perfectly separable from the act of personal reliance. Setting aside <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?...">James 2:14-26</a>, where the argument takes up and uses designedly an inadequate idea of faith (see Commentary on the Romans in this Series, p. 261), the word “faith” consistently conveys in Scripture the thought of personal reliance, trustful acceptance of Divine truth, of Divine work, of the Divine Worker and Lord[23]. And if we venture to ask <span class="ital">why</span> such reliance takes this unique place in the process of salvation, we may reply with reverence that, so far as we can see into the mysterious fact, it is because the essence of such reliance is a going forth from self to God, a bringing of nothing in order to receive everything. There is thus a moral <span class="ital">fitness</span> in faith to be the saving contact and recipient, while yet all ideas of moral <span class="ital">worthiness and deservingness</span> are decisively banished from it. It is <span class="ital">fit</span> to receive the Divine gift, just as a hand, not clean perhaps but empty, is fit to receive a material gift. Certainly in the reasonings of St Paul every effort is made to bring out the thought that salvation by faith means in effect salvation by Christ only and wholly, received by sinful man, as sinful man, simply and directly in and by personal reliance on God’s word. The sinner is led off, in a happy oblivion of himself, to simple and entire rest in his Saviour.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[23] <span class="ital">Fides est fiducia</span> (Luther).

Greek, "upon faith," based upon faith, or on condition of faith. St. Paul speaks of "having" this righteousness. Then it is his; yet it is not any righteousness of his own, "Not by works of righteousness which we have done;" but a righteousness of God given to him, merited, not by his works, but by the perfect obedience and the precious death of Christ, and granted unto all who are found in Christ. It comes from God, the one only Giver of all good things; it is obtained through faith as the instrument or means; and it is given on that faith - on condition, that is, of a living faith abiding in the soul. Thus St. Paul states incidentally, but simply and forcibly, the great doctrine of justification by faith. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be found (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;&#834;)<p>Discovered or proved to be.
