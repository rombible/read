But, strictly speaking, this life, as St. Paul urges in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.">1Corinthians 13:10-11</a>, is but childhood, preparing for the full manhood, or “perfection” of the next; and his disclaimer of perfection above suggests that this higher meaning should in this passage be kept in view. The prospect of being “perfect” in indefectible faith or grace is the Christian’s hope; the claim to be already “perfect” is always recurring in various forms—all natural but unwarrantable anticipations of heaven on earth. St. Paul, by a striking paradox, bids those who hold themselves perfect to prove that they are so by a consciousness of imperfection. If they have it not, he says, they have something yet to learn. “God will reveal even this unto them.” The conviction of the Holy Ghost unites inseparably the “conviction of sin” and the “conviction of righteousness.” The “judgment” of absolute decision between them is not yet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/maclaren/philippians/3.htm">MacLaren's Expositions</a></div>Philippians<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">THE SOUL’S PERFECTION</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Php 3:15</a>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘As many as be perfect’; and how many may they be? Surely a very short bede-roll would contain their names; or would there be any other but the Name which is above every name upon it? Part of the answer to such a question may be found in observing that the New Testament very frequently uses the word to express not so much the idea of moral completeness as that of physical maturity. For instance, when Paul says that he would have his converts to be ‘ men in understanding,’ and when the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of ‘them that are of full age,’ the same word is used as this ‘perfect’ in our text. Clearly in such cases it means ‘full grown,’ as in contrast with ‘babes,’ and expresses not absolute completeness, but what we may term a relative perfection, a certain maturity of character and advanced stage of Christian attainment, far removed from the infantile epoch of the Christian life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another contribution to the answer may be found in observing that in this very context these ‘perfect’ people are exhorted to cultivate the sense of not having ‘already attained,’ and to be constantly reaching forth to unattained heights, so that a sense of imperfection and a continual effort after higher life are parts of Paul’s ‘perfect man.’ And it is to be still further noticed that on the same testimony ‘perfect’ people may probably be ‘otherwise minded’; by which we understand not divergently minded from one another, but ‘otherwise’ than the true norm or law of life would prescribe, and so may stand in need of the hope that God will by degrees bring them into conformity with His will, and show them ‘this,’ namely, their divergence from His Pattern for them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is worth our while to look at these large thoughts thus involved in the words before us.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. Then there are people whom without exaggeration the judgment of truth calls </span> <span class="bld">perfect</span> <span class="bld">.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The language of the New Testament has no scruple in calling men ‘saints’ who had many sins, and none in calling men perfect who had many imperfections; and it does so, not because it has any fantastic theory about religious emotions being the measure of moral purity, but partly for the reasons already referred to, and partly because it wisely considers the main thing about a character to be not the degree to which it has attained completeness in its ideal, but what that ideal is. The distance a man has got on his journey is of less consequence than the direction in which his face is turned. The arrow may fall short, but to what mark was it shot? In all regions of life a wise classification of men arranges them according to their aims rather than their achievements. The visionary who attempts something high and accomplishes scarcely anything of it, is often a far nobler man, and his poor, broken, foiled, resultless life far more perfect than his who aims at marks on the low levels and hits them full. Such lives as these, full of yearning and aspiration, though it be for the most part vain, are<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> ‘<span class="ital">Like the young moon with a ragged edge E’en in its imperfection beautiful.</span>’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If then it be wise to rank men and their pursuits according to their aims rather than their accomplishments, is there one class of aims so absolutely corresponding to man’s nature and relations that to take them for one’s own, and to reach some measure of approximation to them, may fairly be called the perfection of human nature? Is there one way of living concerning which we may say that whosoever adopts it has, in so far as he does adopt it, discerned and attained the purpose of his being? The literal force of the word in our text gives pertinence to that question, for it distinctly means ‘having reached the end.’ And if that be taken as the meaning, there need be no doubt about the answer. Grand old words have taught us long ago ‘Man’s chief end is to glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever.’ Yes, he who lives for God has taken that for his aim which all his nature and all his relations prescribe, he is doing what he was made and meant to do; and however incomplete may be its attainments, the lowest form of a God-fearing, God-obeying life is higher and more nearly ‘perfect’ than the fairest career or character against which, as a blight on all its beauty, the damning accusation may be brought, ‘The God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways, thou hast not glorified.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>People sneer at ‘saints’ and point at their failings. They remind us of the foul stains in David’s career, for instance, and mock as they ask, ‘Is this your man after God’s own heart?’ Yes, he is; not because religion has a morality of its own different from that of the world {except as being higher}, nor because ‘saints’ make up for adultery and murder by making or singing psalms, but because the main set and current of the life was evidently towards God and goodness, and these hideous sins were glaring contradictions, eddies and backwaters, as it were, wept over with bitter self-abasement and conquered by strenuous effort. Better a life of Godward aspiration and straining after purity, even if broken by such a fall, so recovered, than one of habitual earthward grubbing, undisturbed by gross sin.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And another reason warrants the application of the word to men whose present is full of incompleteness, namely, the fact that such men have in them the germ of a life which has no natural end but absolute completeness. The small seed may grow very slowly in the climate and soil which it finds here, and be only a poor little bit of ragged green, very shabby and inconspicuous by the side of the native flowers of earth flaunting around it, but it has a divine germinant virtue within, and waits but being carried to its own clime and ‘planted in the house of the Lord’ above, to ‘flourish in the courts of our God,’ when these others with their glorious beauty have faded away and are flung out to rot.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. We have set forth here very distinctly two of the characteristics of this perfection.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Apostle in our text exhorts the perfect to be ‘ thus minded.’ How is that? Evidently the word points back to the previous clauses, in which he has been describing his own temper and feeling in the Christian race. He sets that before the Philippians as their pattern, or rather invites them to fellowship with him in the estimate of themselves and in their efforts after higher attainments. ‘Be thus minded’ means, Think as I do of yourselves, and do as I do in your daily life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How did he think of himself? He tells us in the sentence before, ‘Not as though I were already perfect. I count not myself to have apprehended.’ So then a leading characteristic of this true Christian perfection is a constant consciousness of imperfection. In all fields of effort, whether intellectual, moral, or mechanical, as faculty grows, consciousness of insufficiency grows with it. The farther we get up the hill, the more we see how far it is to the horizon. The more we know, the more we know our ignorance. The better we can do, the more we discern how much we cannot do. Only people who never have done and never will do anything, or else raw apprentices with the mercifully granted self-confidence of youth, which gets beaten out of most of us soon enough, think that they can do everything.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In morals and in Christian life the same thing is true. The measure of our perfection will be the consciousness of our imperfection--a paradox, but a great truth. It is plain enough that it will be so. Conscience becomes more sensitive as we get nearer right. The worse a man is the less it speaks to him, and the less he hears it. When it ought to thunder it whispers; when we need it most it is least active. The thick skin of a savage will not be disturbed by lying on sharp stones, while a crumpled rose-leaf robs the Sybarite of his sleep. So the practice of evil hardens the cuticle of conscience, and the practice of goodness restores tenderness and sensibility; and many a man laden with crime knows less of its tingling than some fair soul that looks almost spotless to all eyes but its own. One little stain of rust will be conspicuous on a brightly polished blade, but if it be all dirty and dull, a dozen more or fewer will make little difference. As men grow better they become like that glycerine barometer recently introduced, on which a fall or a rise that would have been invisible with mercury to record it takes up inches, and is glaringly conspicuous. Good people sometimes wonder, and sometimes are made doubtful and sad about themselves, by this abiding and even increased consciousness of sin. There is no need to be so. The higher the temperature the more chilling would it be to pass into an ice-house, and the more our lives are brought into fellowship with the perfect life, the more shall we feel our own shortcomings. Let us be thankful if our consciences speak to us more loudly than they used to do. It is a sign of growing holiness, as the tingling in a frost-bitten limb is of returning life. Let us seek to cultivate and increase the sense of our own imperfection, and be sure that the diminution of a consciousness of sin means not diminished power of sin, but lessened horror of it, lessened perception of right, lessened love of goodness, and is an omen of death, not a symptom of life. Painter, scholar, craftsman all know that the condition of advance is the recognition of an ideal not attained. Whoever has not before him a standard to which he has not reached will grow no more. If we see no faults in our work we shall never do any better. The condition of all Christian, as of all other progress, is to be drawn by that fair vision before us, and to be stung into renewed effort to reach it, by the consciousness of present imperfection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Another characteristic to which these perfect men are exhorted is a constant striving after a further advance. How vigorously, almost vehemently, that temper is put in the context--’I follow after’; ‘I press toward the mark’; and that picturesque ‘reaching forth,’ or, as the Revised Version gives it, ‘stretching forward.’ The full force of the latter word cannot be given in any one English equivalent, but may be clumsily hinted by some such phrase as ‘stretching oneself out over,’ as a runner might do with body thrown forward and arms extended in front, and eagerness in every strained muscle, and eye outrunning foot, and hope clutching the goal already. So yearning forward, and setting all the current of his being, both faculty and desire, to the yet unreached mark, the Christian man is to live. His glances are not to be bent backwards, but forwards. He is not to be a ‘praiser of the past,’ but a herald and expectant of a nobler future. He is the child of the day and of the morning, forgetting the things which are behind, and ever yearning towards the things which are before, and drawing them to himself. To look back is to be stiffened into a living death; only with faces set forward are we safe and well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This buoyant energy of hope and effort is to be the result of the consciousness of imperfection of which we have spoken. Strange to many of us, in some moods, that a thing so bright should spring up from a thing so dark, and that the more we feel our own shortcomings, the more hopeful should we be of a future unlike the past, and the more earnest in our effort to make that future the present! There is a type of Christian experience not uncommon among devout people, in which the consciousness of imperfection paralyses effort instead of quickening it; men lament their evil, their slow progress and so on, and remain the same year after year. They are stirred to no effort. There is no straining onwards. They almost seem to lose the faith that they can ever be any better. How different this from the grand, wholesome completeness of Paul’s view here, which embraces both elements, and even draws the undying brightness of his forward-looking confidence from the very darkness of his sense of present imperfection!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So should it be with us, ‘as many as be perfect.’ Before us stretch indefinite possibilities of approximating to the unattainable fulness of the divine life. We may grow in knowledge and in holiness through endless ages and grades of advance. In a most blessed sense we may have that for our highest joy which in another meaning is a punishment of unfaithfulness and indocility, that we shall be ‘ever learning, and never coming to the full knowledge of the truth.’ No limit can be put to what we may receive of God, nor to the closeness, the fulness of our communion with Him, nor to the beauty of holiness which may pass from Him into our poor characters, and irradiate our homely faces. Then, brethren, let us cherish a noble discontent with all that we at present are. Let our spirits stretch out all their powers to the better things beyond, as the plants grown in darkness will send out pale shoots that feel blindly towards the light, or the seed sown on the top of a rock will grope down the bare stone for the earth by which it must be fed. Let the sense of our own weakness ever lead to a buoyant confidence in what we, even we, may become if we will only take the grace we have. To this touchstone let us bring all claims to higher holiness--they who are perfect are most conscious of imperfection, and most eager in their efforts after a further progress in the knowledge, love, and likeness of God in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. We have here also distinctly brought out the co-existence with these characteristics of their opposites.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘If in anything ye are otherwise minded,’ says Paul. I have already suggested that this expression evidently refers not to difference of opinion among themselves, but to a divergence of character from the pattern of feeling and life which he has been proposing to them. If in any respects ye are unconscious of your imperfections, if there be any ‘witch’s mark’ of insensibility in some spot of your conscience to some plain transgressions of law, if in any of you there be some complacent illusion of your own stainlessness, if to any of you the bright vision before you seem faint and unsubstantial, God will show you what you do not see. Plainly then he considers that there will be found among these perfect men states of feeling and estimates of themselves opposed to those which he has been exhorting them to cherish. Plainly he supposes that a good man may pass for a time under the dominion of impulses and theories which are of another kind from those that rule his life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He does not expect the complete and uninterrupted dominion of these higher powers. He recognises the plain facts that the true self, the central life of the soul, the higher nature, ‘the new man,’ abides in a self which is but gradually renewed, and that there is a long distance, so to speak, from the centre to the circumference. That higher life is planted, but its germination is a work of time. The leaven does not leaven the whole mass in a moment, but creeps on from particle to particle. ‘Make the tree good’ and in due time its fruit will be good. But the conditions of our human life are conflict, and these peaceful images of growth and unimpeded natural development, ‘first the blade, then the ear, after that the full corn in the ear,’ are not meant to tell all the truth. Interruptions from external circumstances, struggles of flesh with spirit, and of imagination and heart and will against the better life implanted in the spirit, are the lot of all, even the most advanced here, and however a man may be perfect, there will always be the possibility that in something he may be ‘otherwise minded.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Such an admission does not make such interruptions less blameworthy when they occur. The doctrine of averages does not do away with the voluntary character of each single act. The same number of letters are yearly posted without addresses. Does anybody dream of not scolding the errand boy who posted them, or the servant who did not address them, because he knows that? We are quite sure that we could have resisted each time that we fell. That piece of sharp practice in business, or that burst of bad temper in the household which we were last guilty of--could we have helped it or not? Conscience must answer that question, which does not depend at all on the law of averages. Guilt is not taken away by asserting that sin cleaves to men, ‘perfect men.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the feelings with which we should regard sin and contradictions of men’s truest selves in ourselves and others should be so far altered by such thoughts that we should be very slow to pronounce that a man cannot be a Christian because he has done so and so. Are there any sins which are clearly incompatible with a Christian character? All sins are inconsistent with it, but that is a very different matter. The uniform direction of a man’s life being godless, selfish, devoted to the objects and pursuits of time and sense, is incompatible with his being a Christian--but, thank God, no single act, however dark, is so, if it be in contradiction to the main tendency impressed upon the character and conduct. It is not for us to say that any single deed shows a man cannot be Christ’s, nor to fling ourselves down in despair saying, ‘If I were a Christian, I could not have done that.’ Let us remember that ‘all unrighteousness is sin,’ and the least sin is in flagrant opposition to our Christian profession; but let us also remember, and that not to blunt our consciences or weaken our efforts, that Paul thought it possible for perfect men to be ‘otherwise minded’ from their deepest selves and their highest pattern.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. The crowning hope that lies in these words is the certainty of a gradual but complete attainment of all the Christian aspirations after God and goodness.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ground of that confidence lies in no natural tendencies in us, in no effort of ours, but solely in that great name which is the anchor of all our confidence, the name of God. Why is Paul certain that ‘God will reveal even this unto you’? Because He is God. The Apostle has learned the infinite depth of meaning that lies in that name. He has learned that God is not in the way of leaving off His work before He has done His work, and that none can say of Him, that ‘He began to build, and was not able to finish.’ The assurances of an unchangeable purpose in redemption, and of inexhaustible resources to effect it; of a love that can never fade, and of a grace that can never be exhausted--are all treasured for us in that mighty name. And such confidence is confirmed by the manifest tendency of the principles and motives brought to bear on us in Christianity to lead on to a condition of absolute perfection, as well as by the experience which we may have, if we will, of the sanctifying and renewing power of His Spirit in our Spirit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the discipline of daily life, by the ministry of sorrow and joy, by merciful chastisements dogging our steps when we stray, by duties and cares, by the teaching of His word coming even closer to our hearts and quickening our consciences to discern evil where we had seen none, as well as kindling in us desires after higher and rarer goodness, by the reward of enlarged perceptions of duty and greater love towards it, with which He recompenses lowly obedience to the duty as yet seen, by the secret influences of His Spirit of Power and of Love and of a sound Mind breathed into our waiting spirits, by the touch of His own sustaining hand and glance of His own guiding eye, He will reveal to the lowly soul all that is yet wanting in its knowledge, and communicate all that is lacking in character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>So for us, the true temper is confidence in His power and will, an earnest waiting on Him, a brave forward yearning hope blended with a lowly consciousness of imperfection, which is a spur not a clog, and vigorous increasing efforts to bring into life and character the fulness and beauty of God. Presumption should be as far from us as despair--the one because we have not already attained, the other because ‘God will reveal even this unto us.’ Only let us keep in mind the caution which the Apostle, knowing the possible abuses which might gather round His teaching, has here attached to it, ‘Nevertheless’--though all which I have been saying is true, it is only on this understanding--’Whereto we have already attained, by the same let us walk.’ God will perfect that which concerneth you if--and only if--you go on as you have begun, if you make your creed a life, if you show what you are. If so, then all the rest is a question of time. A has been said, and Z will come in its proper place. Begin with humble trust in Christ, and a process is commenced which has no natural end short of that great hope with which this chapter closes, that the change which begins in the deepest recesses of our being, and struggles slowly and with many interruptions, into partial visibility in our character, shall one day triumphantly irradiate our whole nature out to the very finger-tips, and ‘even the body of our humiliation shall be fashioned like unto the body of Christ’s glory, according to the working whereby He is able even to subdue all things to Himself.’ <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/philippians/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you....">Php 3:15-16</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let us, as many as are perfect — </span>As many as are genuine believers in Christ, thorough Christians, justified and regenerated, new creatures in Christ, and so fit for the Christian race of duty and suffering; <span class="ital">be thus minded </span>— Minded as I have said that I am, namely, inclined and determined to press forward with zeal and diligence to still higher attainments in holiness, usefulness, and patient sufferings, till as Christ was, they are made in this world.

Macknight takes the passage in rather another sense, namely, as signifying “that such of the Philippians as sincerely feared the Lord, if they happened, from ignorance or prejudice, to think differently from the apostle concerning any important article of faith, would have their error discovered to them, not by a particular revelation, but by the ordinary influences of the Spirit, agreeably to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-12.htm" title="What man is he that fears the LORD? him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.">Psalm 25:12</a>, <span class="ital">What man is he who feareth the Lord, him shall he teach in the way that he shall choose.”</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect - see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12</a>. Or, rather, those who would be perfect; or who are aiming at perfection. It can hardly be supposed that the apostle would address them as already perfect, when he had just said of himself that lie had not attained to that state. But those whom he addressed might be supposed to be aiming at perfection, and he exhorts them, therefore, to have the same spirit that he himself had, and to make the same efforts which he himself put forth.<p>Be thus minded - That is, be united in the effort to obtain the prize, and to become entirely perfect. "Let them put forth the same effort which I do, forgetting what is behind, and pressing forward to the mark."<p>And if in anything ye be otherwise minded - That is, if there were any among them who had not these elevated views and aims, and who had not been brought to see the necessity of such efforts, or who had not learned that such high attainments were possible. There might be those among them who had been very imperfectly instructed in the nature of religion; those who entertained views which impeded their progress, and prevented the simple and earnest striving for salvation which Paul was enabled to put forth. He had laid aside every obstacle; renounced all the Jewish opinions which had impeded his salvation, and had now one single aim - that of securing the prize. But there might be those who had not attained to these views, and who were still impeded and embarrassed by erroneous opinions.<p>God shall reveal even this unto you - He will correct your erroneous opinions, and disclose to you the importance of making this effort for the prize. This is the expression of an opinion, that to those who were sincere and true Christians, God would yet make a full revelation of the nature of religion, or would lead them on so that they would fully understand, it. They who are acquainted with religion at all, or who have been truly converted, God will teach and guide until they shall have a full understanding of divine things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. therefore&#8212;resuming Php 3:3.

Though "perfect" in this sense, he was not yet "made perfect" (Greek) in the sense intended in Php 3:12, namely, "crowned with complete victory," and having attained absolute perfection.<p>thus minded&#8212;having the mind which he had described, Php 3:7-14.<p>otherwise minded&#8212;having too high an opinion of yourselves as to your attainment of Christian perfection. "He who thinks that he has attained everything, hath nothing" [Chrysostom]. Probably, too, he refers to those who were tempted to think to attain to perfection by the law (Ga 3:3): who needed the warning (Php 3:3), "Beware of the concision," though on account of their former piety, Paul hopes confidently (as in Ga 5:10) that God will reveal the path of right-mindedness to them. Paul taught externally God "reveals" the truth internally by His Spirit (Mt 11:25; 16:17; 1Co 3:6).<p>unto you&#8212;who sincerely strive to do God's will (Joh 7:17; Eph 1:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> A learned man reads it from the Greek to this purpose: As many therefore as are perfect, let us think this; and if ye think any thing otherwise, even this also God will, or may, reveal to you, (besides what we have attained to), to walk by the same rule, to think the same thing: conceiving it not congruous to the sense, or syntax, but alien from all manner of speaking, to translate it imperatively: <span class="ital">Let us walk by the same rule.</span> But following our own translation: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Let us therefore, as many as be perfect; </span> from the instance of himself, imitating Christ, in loving condescension and lowliness of mind, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Philippians 2:3</a>,5</span>, worshipping God in the spirit, and not having confidence in the flesh, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Philippians 3:3</a></span>, in the fellowship of Christ’s sufferings, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm" title="That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable to his death;">Philippians 3:10</a></span>, pressing forward to absolute perfection, he here doth with himself encourage as many rulers and ruled who were settled in the fundamentals of Christianity, and who had made progress in holiness, to mind that main business of religion, for the prevention of what might ensue upon exasperating differences; whereupon he styles them comparatively perfect in the way, not in the heavenly country, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-10.htm" title="But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.">1 Corinthians 13:10</a></span>; which doth not disagree with what he said before, if we further distinguish of a perfection: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The special aspect of this maturity, which Paul had in view in using <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span>, is to be regarded, not as <span class="ital">theoretical knowledge</span>,—the doctrine of <span class="ital">righteousness by faith</span> being conceived to be specially referred to (Erasmus, Wolf, Rheinwald, and others),—but as the <span class="ital">moral</span> character and striving of believers, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Php 3:13</a> f., along with which the corresponding relation of practical insight is self-evident as a necessary presupposition (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-12.htm" title=" Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ, salutes you, always laboring fervently for you in prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of God.">Colossians 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-28.htm" title=" Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom; that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus:">Colossians 1:28</a>); although there is no reason to suppose that particular questions in this domain (such as those relating to sacrificial flesh, fasts, feasts, and the like) had arisen in Philippi and occasioned division, of which no trace exists. The jealousy and partial disunion in the church arose from a <span class="ital">moral conceit</span>, which was prejudicial to mutual humility (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-3.htm" title="Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves.">Php 2:3</a> ff.) and to personal genuine striving after holiness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-12.htm" title="Why, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.">Php 2:12</a> ff.).

A tone of <span class="ital">irony</span> (Schenkel) is utterly alien to the heartfelt character of the whole discourse, which is, moreover, in this application, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-15.htm" title="Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded: and if in any thing you be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this to you.">Php 3:15</a>, so expressed as to include the apostle in common with his readers. To the Catholic fictions of a state of perfection the passage is in direct opposition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦτο φρονῶμεν</span>] <span class="ital">let us have this frame of mind</span>, namely, which I, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Php 3:13</a> f., have just expressed as mine; the frame of humble self-estimation, and at the same time incessant pressing forward.

Besides, the <span class="greekheb">φρονῶμεν</span>, which is correlative with the <span class="greekheb">λογίζομαι</span>, does not point back beyond <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Php 3:13</a> f. Therefore, not even the appropriation of Christ, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/3-8.htm" title="Yes doubtless, and I count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ,...">Php 3:8-11</a>, is to be included in the reference of the <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> (in opposition to de Wette and Wiesinger). Van Hengel is inclined to refer <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο</span> to <span class="greekheb">τὸ βραβεῖον</span>; but the readers needed the exhortation <span class="ital">to the right mode of striving</span> after the <span class="greekheb">βραβεῖον</span>, and not <span class="ital">the</span> summons generally, that they should have the <span class="greekheb">βραβ</span>. in view. This applies also against the similar, although more exact, interpretation of Fritzsche (<span class="ital">Diss. II. in 2 Cor</span>. p. 92): “<span class="ital">hac mente simus</span> sc. <span class="ital">ut</span> <span class="greekheb">τὸ βραβ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τῆς ἄνω κλήσεως</span> <span class="ital">consectemur</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ εἴ τι ἑτέρως φρον</span>.] <span class="ital">and if as to any point</span> (<span class="greekheb">τὶ</span>, accusative of the object) <span class="ital">ye be otherwise minded</span>, take up another way of thinking, varying, namely, from that specified in <span class="greekheb">τοῦτο φρονῶμεν</span>. A man may, forsooth, have in general the same frame of mind which Paul has represented in himself, and to which he has summoned his readers; but at the same time an isolated concrete case (<span class="greekheb">τὶ</span>) may occur, which a man cannot fit into the <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span> in question, and regarding which he is of opinion that he ought to be differently minded, so that in such a state of things he becomes <span class="ital">morally inconsistent</span> in his frame of mind, inasmuch as he lacks the befitting <span class="greekheb">ἐπίγνωσις</span> and <span class="greekheb">αἴσθησις εἰς τὸ δοκιμάζειν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Php 1:9</a>, in the moral judgment which determines the <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span>. Hofmann arbitrarily limits the <span class="greekheb">τὶ</span> to some matter <span class="ital">independent of the essential disposition of the Christian life</span>. This sense would have required a more precise definition, in order to be found. And the hope which is uttered in the apodosis, is in perfect harmony with the prayer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;">Php 1:9</a> f.; hence Hofmann’s objection, that the readers <span class="ital">must have themselves corrected</span> the fault which according to our view here emerges, is quite groundless. The <span class="ital">subject addressed</span> is the <span class="ital">readers generally</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-17.htm" title="Brothers, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so as you have us for an ensample.">Php 3:17</a>), not the <span class="greekheb">νήπιοι</span> (Hunnius, Wolf, Bengel, Storr, and others, including Flatt, Rheinwald, Hoelemann, Rilliet, Reiche), whom several expositors have regarded as those who had not yet raised themselves to the pure righteousness of faith excluding the law (see Rheinwald and Reiche), or who had allowed themselves to be led away by false teachers (see Hunnius, Grotius, Storr). But setting aside the arbitrariness generally with which this contrast is introduced, it is opposed by the fact, that Paul does not assume any thorough and essential diversity in the <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span>, but only such a variation as might affect some one or other isolated point (<span class="greekheb">τὶ</span>), and that not in the doctrinal, but in the moral province of Christian conduct. Moreover, if <span class="ital">persons led astray</span> were here in question, nothing would be less in harmony with the character of the apostle than the hopeful tolerance which is expressed in the words <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύψει</span>. Lastly, the change of person (in opposition to Bengel) was necessary, because Paul, speaking of a partial <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρως φρονεῖν</span>, <span class="ital">could</span> not include himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <span class="greekheb">ἑτέρως</span>, <span class="ital">otherwise</span> (not occurring elsewhere in the N.

Nem</span>. viii. 3, <span class="ital">Pyth</span>. iii. 54; Wyttenbach, <span class="ital">ad Plat. Phaed</span>. p. 321). It is here the <span class="greekheb">ἑτεροδοξεῖν</span> (Plat. <span class="ital">Theaet</span>. pp. 190 E, 193 D), as <span class="ital">frame of mind</span>. This has not been attended to by van Hengel, when he takes with equal unsuitableness <span class="greekheb">τὶ</span> in an emphatic sense, and <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖν</span> as to <span class="ital">strive for:</span> “si <span class="ital">quid boni</span> per aliam viam <span class="ital">expetitis</span>, quam ego persequor.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο ὁ Θεὸς ὑμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀποκ</span>.] Expression of the <span class="ital">hope</span> that such variations will not fail to be rectified, on the part of God, by His revealing operation. Certainly, therefore, the variations, which Paul so forbearingly and confidently and without polemical handling commits to revealing correction on the part of God, were not on matters of principle or of an anti-Pauline character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο</span>] <span class="ital">this also</span>, like other things which He has already revealed unto you; so that in <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> is contained the idea <span class="ital">also still</span> (Hartung, <span class="ital">Partikell</span>. I. p. 135). Hofmann erroneously says that <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> implies: <span class="ital">there, where the disposition is present, which I require</span>.

Calvin aptly says: “Nemo ita loqui jure posset, nisi cui certa constat suae doctrinae ratio et veritas.” The passage is very far from betraying uncertainty or want of firmness (Baur).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλύψει</span>, which is to be taken as purely future, is conceived by Paul as taking place <span class="ital">through the Holy Spirit</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-10.htm" title=" That you might walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;">Colossians 1:10</a>), not by human instruction (Beza).

This is the inward divine unveiling of ethical truth, which is needed for the practical reason <span class="ital">of him</span> who in any respect otherwise <span class="greekheb">φρονεῖ</span> than Paul has shown in his own example; for <span class="greekheb">οὐ περὶ δογμάτων ταῦτα εἴρηται</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ περὶ βίον τελειότητος καὶ τοῦ μὴ νομίζειν ἑαυτοὺς τελείους εἶναι</span>, Chrysostom. Wherever in this moral respect the right frame of mind is not yet completely present in one or the other, Paul trusts to the disclosing operation of God Himself, whose Spirit rules and works in the Church and its individual members (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-16.htm" title="Know you not that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?">1 Corinthians 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-17.htm" title="That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you the spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him:">Ephesians 1:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-21.htm" title="In whom all the building fitly framed together grows to an holy temple in the Lord:">Ephesians 2:21</a> f.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-9.htm" title="But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you.

In all these passages <span class="greekheb">τέλ</span>. depends upon knowledge, knowledge gained by long experience of Christ, resulting both in firm conviction and maturity of thought and conduct. It has not so much our idea of “perfect” = “flawless,” as of “perfect” = “having reached a certain point of completeness,” as of one who has come to his full growth, leaving behind him the state of childhood (<span class="greekheb">νήπιος</span>). <span class="ital">Cf.</span> chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/1-9.htm" title="And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment;...">Php 1:9-10</a>. Lft[8]. supposes a reminiscence of the technical term <span class="greekheb">τέλειος</span>, used in the Mysteries to denote the <span class="ital">initiated</span>, and imagines Paul to speak with a certain irony of people at Philippi who claimed to be in this fortunate position as regards the Christian faith. There is no need to assume here the language of the Mysteries (as Anrich shows, <span class="ital">Das Antike Mysterienwesen</span>, Gött., 1894, p. 146, <span class="ital">n.</span> 1), or to find irony in Paul’s words. Probably there <span class="ital">were</span> some (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-13.htm" title="Brothers, I count not myself to have apprehended: but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth to those things which are before,">Php 3:13</a> <span class="ital">supr.</span>) at Philippi who boasted of a spiritual superiority to their brethren and who may have called themselves <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span>. This may have been due to special equipment with the Spirit manifesting itself in speaking with tongues, etc. See 1 Corinthians 12 <span class="ital">passim</span>. But Paul takes the word seriously and points out what it involves. [Wernle’s attempt in <span class="ital">Der Christ u. die Sünde bei Paul.</span>, pp. 6–7, to show that this passage is no argument against Christian perfection which he believes Paul to hold, rests on the erroneous association of <span class="greekheb">τέλ</span>. with the Mysteries.]—<span class="greekheb">τοῦτο φρ</span>. Let us show our humble conviction that we are still far from the goal which we desire to attain.—<span class="greekheb">καὶ εἴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀποκαλ</span>. If, in the case of any separate detail of character or knowledge, you imagine yourselves to be <span class="greekheb">τέλειοι</span>, to have reached the highest point, God will reveal the truth (the true standpoint of humility) on this matter also. The form of the conditional sentence suggests that Paul knew of persons at Philippi who had erroneous views on this subject. But his hint of rebuke is very delicately put. <span class="greekheb">εἴ τι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. It is far-fetched to take this (as Hpt[9]. does) of their judgment on the Judaisers. Paul has forgotten, for the time, the special anxiety which weighs upon him, and has become absorbed in the glorious vista which unfolds itself to the Christian. <span class="greekheb">καὶ τοῦτο κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.

See esp[10]. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-10.htm" title="But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searches all things, yes, the deep things of God.">1 Corinthians 2:10</a> (and <span class="ital">Cf.</span> Von Soden, <span class="ital">Abhandlungen C. v.

On the surface, but not really. The Apostle appears to be taking up the favourite word of teachers who upheld some phase of “perfectionism,” and using it, with loving irony, on the side of truth; as if to say, “Are you, are we, <span class="ital">ideal</span> Christians, <span class="ital">perfect</span> Christians, all that Christians should be? Then among the things that <span class="ital">should be</span> in our character is a holy discontent with, and criticism of, our own present attainment. The man in this sense <span class="ital">‘perfect’</span> will be sure to think himself <span class="ital">not perfected</span>.”—And it is important to remember that the Greek word rendered “perfect” is an elastic word. It may mean “adult,” “mature,” as against infantine; cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/5-13.htm" title="For every one that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness: for he is a babe....">Hebrews 5:13-14</a>. A “perfect” Christian in this respect may have spiritual <span class="ital">faculty</span> well developed, and yet be very far from “perfected” in spiritual <span class="ital">character</span>.—Such considerations, in the light of this whole passage, will do anything for such a Christian rather than teach him to tolerate sin in himself; they will at once keep him humble and contrite, and animate him to ever fresh developments in and by Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">be … minded</span>] The same word as that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-7.htm" title="Even as it is meet for me to think this of you all, because I have you in my heart; inasmuch as both in my bonds, and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, you all are partakers of my grace.">Php 1:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-2.htm" title="Fulfill you my joy, that you be like minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind.">Php 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-5.htm" title="Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:">Php 2:5</a>, where see notes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">God shall reveal</span>] by the action of His Holy Spirit on heart, mind, and will, amidst the discipline of life. There need not be any new verbal revelation, but there would be a new inward revelation of the correspondence of the inspired Word with the facts of the soul, and so a fresh light on those facts.—Such language implies the Apostle’s certainty of his commission as the inspired messenger of Christ; it would otherwise be the language of undue assumption.

"Perfect" here means mature, full grown, as opposed to babes or children. The word is so used (in the Greek) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-20.htm">1 Corinthians 14:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-13.htm">Ephesians 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm">Hebrews 5:14</a>. "There is a difference," says Bengel, on ver. 12, "between the perfect and the perfected: the first are ready for the. race; the last are close upon the prize." St. Paul exhorts all full-grown Christians to imitate his perseverance; like him, to forsake any claims to legal righteousness; to seek that righteousness which is through the faith of Christ; to know Christ, to win Christ; to press ever forwards to obtain the prize. <span class="cmt_word">And if in anything ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you</span>.. If only we be in earnest, pressing onwards in the Christian race with sustained perseverance, God will, by the manifestation of his Spirit in our heart, correct any minor errors of doctrine or of practice. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-17.htm">John 7:17</a>, "If any man willeth to do (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f73;&#x3bb;&#x1fc3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span>) his will, he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of God." "Otherwise" (<span class="greek">&#x1f11;&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;</span>) seems here to mean otherwise thin is right, wrongly, amiss - a meaning which it has not unfrequently in classical Greek, and in our word "heterodox." Even <span class="accented">this</span>; rather, <span class="accented">this too</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> well as the one thing needful, the knowledge of Christ, which he has already revealed. Mark the word "reveal." Paul may teach, but living spiritual knowledge is a revelation from God. This passage shows that the word "perfect" is used here in a restricted sense, not of consummated holiness; as it implies that some of the "perfect" may be "otherwise minded," may be involved in minor errors. Good Christians must have that righteousness which is through faith; they must persevere: they may err in less essential points. It is a lesson of charity and humility. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/philippians/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Toward the mark (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Rev., goal.
