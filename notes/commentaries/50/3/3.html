The prophet calls the false prophets dumb dogs, Isa 56:10; to which the apostle seems to refer. Dogs, for their malice against faithful professors of the gospel of Christ, barking at them and biting them. They urged human works in opposition to the faith of Christ; but Paul calls them evil-workers. He calls them the concision; as they rent the church of Christ, and cut it to pieces. The work of religion is to no purpose, unless the heart is in it, and we must worship God in the strength and grace of the Divine Spirit. They rejoice in Christ Jesus, not in mere outward enjoyments and performances. Nor can we too earnestly guard against those who oppose or abuse the doctrine of free salvation. If the apostle would have gloried and trusted in the flesh, he had as much cause as any man. But the things which he counted gain while a Pharisee, and had reckoned up, those he counted loss for Christ. The apostle did not persuade them to do any thing but what he himself did; or to venture on any thing but that on which he himself ventured his never-dying soul. He deemed all these things to be but loss, compared with the knowledge of Christ, by faith in his person and salvation. He speaks of all worldly enjoyments and outward privileges which sought a place with Christ in his heart, or could pretend to any merit and desert, and counted them but loss; but it might be said, It is easy to say so; but what would he do when he came to the trial? He had suffered the loss of all for the privileges of a Christian. Nay, he not only counted them loss, but the vilest refuse, offals thrown to dogs; not only less valuable than Christ, but in the highest degree contemptible, when set up as against him. True knowledge of Christ alters and changes men, their judgments and manners, and makes them as if made again anew. The believer prefers Christ, knowing that it is better for us to be without all worldly riches, than without Christ and his word. Let us see what the apostle resolved to cleave to, and that was Christ and heaven. We are undone, without righteousness wherein to appear before God, for we are guilty. There is a righteousness provided for us in Jesus Christ, and it is a complete and perfect righteousness. None can have benefit by it, who trust in themselves. Faith is the appointed means of applying the saving benefit. It is by faith in Christ's blood. We are made conformable to Christ's death, when we die to sin, as he died for sin; and the world is crucified to us, and we to the world, by the cross of Christ. The apostle was willing to do or to suffer any thing, to attain the glorious resurrection of saints. This hope and prospect carried him through all difficulties in his work. He did not hope to attain it through his own merit and righteousness, but through the merit and righteousness of Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we are the circumcision - We who are Christians. We have and hold the true doctrine of circumcision. We have that which was intended to be secured by this rite - for we are led to renounce the flesh, and to worship God in the spirit. The apostle in this verse teaches that the ordinance of circumcision was not designed to be a mere outward ceremony, but was intended to be emblematic of the renunciation of the flesh with its corrupt propensities, and to lead to the pure and spiritual worship of God. In this, he has undoubtedly stated its true design. They who now urged it as necessary to salvation, and who made salvation depend on its mere outward observance, had lost sight of this object of the rite. But this, the real design of circumcision, was attained by those who had been led to renounce the flesh, and who had devoted themselves to the worship of God; see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/2-28.htm">Romans 2:28-29</a>.<p>Which worship God in the spirit - See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-24.htm">John 4:24</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-10.htm">Genesis 17:10-14</a>.<p>And rejoice in Christ Jesus - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>. That is, we have, through him, renounced the flesh; we have become the true worshippers of God, and have thus attained what was originally contemplated by circumcision, and by all the other rites of religion.<p>And have no confidence in the flesh - In our own corrupt nature; or in any ordinances that relate merely to the flesh. We do not depend on circumcision for salvation, or on any external rites and forms whatever - on any advantage of rank, or blood. The word "flesh" here seems to refer to every advantage which any may have of birth; to any external conformity to the law, and to everything which unaided human nature can do to effect salvation. Or none of these things can we put reliance for salvation; none of them will constitute a ground of hope. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

And not they; they have the name, and we the thing, or that which legal circumcision was a shadow of, namely, circumcision of the heart; which lies in being pricked to the heart under a true sense of sin; in having the hardness of the heart removed, and the iniquity of it laid to open view; in pain and contrition of heart about it, joined with shame for it, and loathing of it, the consequence of which is, a putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>, according to the former conversation; and also in a renouncing a man's own righteousness in point of justification before God, and acceptance with him. All which is the work of God, and not man, and is therefore called the circumcision made without hands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>; it has God, and not man, for its author; and its praise is of God, and not of men; and its seat is in the heart and spirit, and not in the flesh; and such whose hearts are circumcised to love the Lord their God, and fear him, are the true circumcision: <p>which worship God in the spirit. The object of worship is "God", and him only; not a creature animate or inanimate, stocks or stones, beasts, birds, men, or angels; only God, Father, Son, and Spirit: that the Father is to be worshipped, is not disputed, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-21.htm">John 4:21</a>; and the Son is to be worshipped with the same worship the Father is; since he is in the form of God, and equal to him, is the Creator of all the Lord of angels and men, and is to be, and is worshipped by both; prayer is made unto him, baptism is administered in his name, and trust and confidence are placed in him; and so is the Holy Ghost, he being equally God with the Father and the Son, and therefore the same homage is to be given to him as to them: and so some indeed read the words here, "which worship God the Spirit"; or the Spirit, who is God. "Worship" is either inward or outward; inward worship lies in the exercise of grace on God, as of faith, hope, love, fear, &amp;c. outward worship is the performance of certain external actions required by God, and both are to be performed: and it is also either private or public; private worship is in the closet, or in the family, and consists of praying, singing of praises, &amp;c. public worship lies in tire observance of the outward ordinances of preaching, praying, hearing singing, &amp;c. in the church of God; even all such ordinances as God has appointed, which are recorded in the Scriptures, and are confirmed by the authority of Christ. The manner in which worship is to be performed, is "in the Spirit"; either in and with the Spirit of God, without whose grace and assistance no part of it can be performed well. And the Alexandrian copy reads, "which worship in the Spirit of God"; and so the Complutensian edition, and several copies. Or in and with our own hearts and spirits, which should be engaged in every part of religious worship with much attention, diligence, and fervency; or in a spiritual manner, in opposition to the carnal worship of the Jews, and the bodily exercise of formal professors; and which lies in drawing nigh to God with true hearts, sincere and fervent ones, with grace in them, and that in exercise: <p>and rejoice in Christ Jesus; or "glory in" him, and make their boast of him; for a different word is here used from that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>. Such who have a true sense of themselves, and a spiritual sight of Christ, will not glory in themselves, in their wisdom, strength, riches, or righteousness, but in Christ, in his wisdom and strength, in his riches and righteousness, and in his person and grace only: <p>and have no confidence in the flesh; in any carnal descent, or birth privilege, as to be of the seed of Abraham, of the of Israel, or of such a tribe, or family, or born of such a parent; nor in circumcision, or any of the carnal ordinances of the ceremonial law; nor in any civil, moral, legal, and external righteousness, for so to do is but to make flesh an arm; or indeed to trust in anything out of Christ, or short of him; and all this makes up the character and description of a true believer in Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> in the flesh.</span><p>(3) He shows that we ought to use true circumcision, that is, the circumcision of the heart, so that by cutting off all wicked affections by the power of Christ, we may serve God in purity of life.<p>(c) In outward things which do not at all pertain to the soul.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/philippians/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-3.htm" title="For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.">Php 3:3</a>.

The contrast drawn, which has already been before his mind in the ironical expression <span class="greekheb">κατατομή</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἡ περιτ</span>. In LXX it is only found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/17-12.htm" title="And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every man child in your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of your seed.">Genesis 17:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-25.htm" title="Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband are you to me.">Exodus 4:25</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-16.htm" title="The LORD called your name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he has kindled fire on it, and the branches of it are broken.">Jeremiah 11:16</a> has another sense). The verb <span class="greekheb">περιτέμνω</span> is very common. Perhaps the choice of this particular compound to denote the rite of circumcision is due, as Dsm[26]. (<span class="ital">BS</span>[27]., p. 151) suggests, to the Egyptian use of it as a technical term for the same custom, long in vogue among the Egyptians. Examples are found in the Papyri. Paul uses it here in its strict sense as a token of participation in the covenant with God and of obligation to maintain it. But the further idea belonged to it of being the outward symbol of an inward grace. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-6.htm" title="And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.">Deuteronomy 30:6</a>. As the rite was regarded essentially as one of purification, the grace associated with it was a cleansing process. This explains expressions like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-26.htm" title="Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.">Jeremiah 9:26</a>, etc.—<span class="greekheb">οἱ</span> … <span class="greekheb">λατρεύοντες</span>. The participle has become a noun denoting a class of men, spiritual worshippers. Contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-14.htm" title="How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?">Hebrews 9:14</a>. Most edd. with a number of high authorities read <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> (see crit. note <span class="ital">supr.</span>). This gives a peculiar combination: “who worship by the Spirit of God”. But the occurrence of <span class="greekheb">σαρκί</span> immediately after clearly suggests the favourite Pauline antithesis of <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> and <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. In that case <span class="greekheb">Θεῷ</span>, which is supported by some excellent evidence, would be the natural reading, governed by <span class="greekheb">λατρεύοντες</span>. Aptly parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>, <span class="greekheb">ὁ Θεὸς ᾧ λατρεύω ἐν τῷ πνεύματί μου</span>. Certainly <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, as the more difficult reading, must be considered. But as <span class="greekheb">λατρεύω</span> had come to have the technical sense of worshipping God, the word might be altered at an early date to get rid of a superfluity.—<span class="greekheb">λατρ</span>. In LXX it is used exclusively of the service of God, true or false. But it is distinguished from its synonym <span class="greekheb">λειτουργεῖν</span> as including the worship of the people as well as the ritual of the priests and Levites. See esp[28]. SH[29]. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>.—<span class="greekheb">καυχώμενοι</span>. One of the Apostle’s most characteristic words. It expresses with great vividness the high level of Christian life at which he is living: “exulting in Christ Jesus”. It belongs to the same triumphant mood which finds utterance so often in this Epistle in <span class="greekheb">χαίρω</span>. This victorious Christian gladness ought to sweep them past all earthly formalism and bondage to “beggarly elements”.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐν ς</span>. <span class="greekheb">πεποιθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐκ</span> (instead of <span class="greekheb">μή</span>) emphasises the <span class="ital">actual</span> condition of their own Christian life.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>. On the phrase see Dsm[30]., <span class="ital">N.T. Formel</span> “<span class="ital">in Christo</span>,” p. 125, who regards it as following the analogy of the Pauline <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>. This is manifestly so in our instance where the expressions stand in juxtaposition. <span class="ital">Carnem appellat quicquid est extra Christum</span> (Calvin). Here <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> has a double antithesis, both <span class="greekheb">Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. and <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span>. The ordinary use of “self” in the popular religious vocabulary corresponds with wonderful accuracy to the Pauline <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> (so also Moule). For a strangely kindred conception <span class="ital">cf.</span> Seneca, <span class="ital">ad Marc.</span>, 24, 5: <span class="ital">illi</span> (<span class="ital">animo</span>) <span class="ital">cum hac carne grave certamen est</span> (quoted by Hltzm[31]., <span class="ital">N.T. Th.</span>, ii., p. 21). Of course <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span> has become a technical term in Paul’s controversy with the Judaisers, and that particular side of its meaning must always be kept in view (see Romans and Galatians <span class="ital">passim</span>).—<span class="greekheb">πεποιθ</span>. The word occurs no less than six times in this short Epistle. Paul has reached firm convictions on the highest things. He <span class="ital">knows</span> what he believes and what he rejects. That is the real explanation of his strong, exultant joy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[26] Deissmann (<span class="ital">BS. = Bibelstudien, NBS. = Neue Bibelstudien</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[27] <span class="ital">.</span> Bibelstudien<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] especially.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] .

The verb here (<span class="ital">latreuein</span>) originally imports any sort of service, domestic or otherwise; but usage gives it in the N.T. a fixed connexion with the service of <span class="ital">worship</span>, and occasionally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/8-5.htm" title="Who serve to the example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the tabernacle: for, See, said he, that you make all things according to the pattern showed to you in the mount.">Hebrews 8:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-9.htm" title="Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;">Hebrews 9:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/10-2.htm" title="For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because that the worshippers once purged should have had no more conscience of sins.">Hebrews 10:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-10.htm" title="We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle.">Hebrews 13:10</a>) a special reference to the worship of <span class="ital">priestly ritual</span>.

A fair popular equivalent for it would be “self,” as far as that word expresses that attitude or condition of our moral being which is not subject to God’s law or reliant on His grace. The “flesh” is sometimes that state, or element, of man in which sin predominates; whatever in man is not ruled and possessed by the Holy Spirit; the unsanctified intellect, the unsanctified affections. The “flesh” is sometimes, again, as here, anything other than God taken by man as his trust and strength, e.g. religious observances regarded as occasion for self-confidence. In this latter case the word “flesh” is, as here, shifted, so to speak, by a natural transition of language, from the chooser to the thing chosen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>See further on this word <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-4.htm" title="That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit.">Romans 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-3.htm" title="Among whom also we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind; and were by nature the children of wrath, even as others.">Ephesians 2:3</a>; and notes in this Series.
