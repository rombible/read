It should be, <span class= "ital">who shall change the fashion of the body of our humiliation, to be conformed to the body of His glory.</span> (1) On the difference between “fashion” and “form,” see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-7.htm" title="But made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men:">Philippians 2:7-8</a>. The contrast here signifies that humiliation is but the outward fashion or vesture of the body; the likeness to Christ is, and will be seen to be, its essential and characteristic nature. This “humiliation” marks our condition in this life, as fallen from our true humanity under the bondage of sin and death. The body is not really “vile,” though it is fallen and degraded. (2) “His glory” is His glorified human nature, as it was after the Resurrection, as it is now in His ascended majesty, as it shall be seen at His second coming. What it is and will be we gather from the sublime descriptions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/1-13.htm" title="And in the middle of the seven candlesticks one like to the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle.">Revelation 1:13-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/revelation/19-12.htm" title="His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he himself.">Revelation 19:12-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-11.htm" title="And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them.">Revelation 20:11</a>. What is here briefly described as change to conformity with that glory is worked out in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:">1Corinthians 15:42-44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-53.htm" title="For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.">1Corinthians 15:53-54</a>, into the contrast between corruption and incorruption, dishonour and glory, weakness and power, the natural (animal) body and the spiritual body. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="But we all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the LORD.">2Corinthians 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2Corinthians 4:16</a>, we read of the beginning of glorification in the spirit here; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/4-17.htm" title="For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory;">2Corinthians 4:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.">2Corinthians 5:1-4</a>, of the completion of “the exceeding weight of glory” in the hereafter, as glorifying also “our house which is in heaven. St. John describes that glorification with brief emphatic solemnity, “We shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is,” and draws out explicitly the moral which St. Paul here implies, “Every man that hath this hope purifieth himself, even as He is pure.”<p><span class= "bld">According to the working . . .</span>—Properly, <span class= "ital">in virtue of the effectual working of His power to subject all things to Himself.</span> Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm" title="And what is the exceeding greatness of his power to us-ward who believe, according to the working of his mighty power,">Ephesians 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-7.htm" title="Whereof I was made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of God given to me by the effectual working of his power.">Ephesians 3:7</a>, and Notes there. Here, as there, St. Paul speaks of His power as not dormant or existing in mere capacity, but as energetic in working, unhasting and unresting. Here briefly, as more fully in the celebrated passage of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-24.htm" title="Then comes the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.">1Corinthians 15:24-28</a>) he describes it as “subduing all things unto Himself,” till the consummation of this universal conquest in the Last Judgment and the delivery of “the kingdom to God, even the Father . . . that God may be all in all.” Of that power the primary exhibition, in which He is pleased to delight, is in salvation, gradually preparing His own for heaven; the secondary exhibition, undertaken under a moral necessity, is in retributive judgment. It is of the former only that St. Paul speaks here, as it shall be made perfect in the resurrection unto eternal life.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who shall change our vile body - compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15.htm">1 Corinthians 15</a>:The original words, which are rendered here as "vile body," properly mean "the body of humiliation;" that is, our humble body. It refers to the body as it is in its present state, as subject to infirmities, disease, and death. It is different far from what it was when man was created, and from what it will be in the future world. Paul says that it is one of the objects of the Christian hope and expectation, that this body, so subject to infirmities and sicknesses, will be changed.<p>That it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body - Greek, "The body Of his glory;" that is, the body which he has in his glorified state. What change the body of the Redeemer underwent when he ascended to heaven, we are not informed - nor do we know what is the nature, size, appearance, or form of the body which he now has. It is certain that it is adapted to the glorious world where he dwells; that it has none of the infirmities to which it was liable when here; that it is not subject; as here, to pain or death; that it is not sustained in the same manner. The body of Christ in heaven is of the same nature as the bodies of the saints will be in the resurrection, and which the apostle calls "spiritual bodies," (notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>); and it is doubtless accompanied with all the circumstances of splendor and glory which are appropriate to the Son of God. The idea here is, that it is the object of the desire and anticipation of the Christian, to be made just like Christ in all things. He desires to resemble him in moral character here, and to be like him in heaven. Nothing else will satisfy him but such conformity to the Son of God; and when he shall resemble him in all things, the wishes of his soul will all be met and fulfilled.<p>According to the working ... - That is, such a change demands the exertion of vast power. No creature can do it. But there is One who has power entrusted to him over all things, and he can effect this great transformation in the bodies of people; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-26.htm">1 Corinthians 15:26-27</a>. He can mould the mind and the heart to conformity to his own image, and thus also he can transform the body so that it shall resemble his. Everything he can make subject to his will. (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/28-18.htm">Matthew 28:18</a>, note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/17-2.htm">John 17:2</a>, note.) And he that has this power can change our humbled and debased bodies, so that they shall put on the glorious appearance and form of that of the Son of God himself. What a contrast between our bodies here - frail, feeble, subject to sickness, decay, and corruption - and the body as it will be in heaven! And what a glorious prospect awaits the weak and dying believer, in the future world!<p>Remarks On <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3.htm">Philippians 3</a><p>1. It is a privilege of the Christian to rejoice; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm">Philippians 3:1</a>. He has more sources of real joy than any other persons; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:16</a>. He has a Saviour in whom he may always find peace; a God whose character he can always contemplate with pleasure a heaven to look forward to where there is nothing but happiness; a Bible that is full of precious promises, and at all times the opportunity of prayer, in which he may roll all Iris sorrows on the arms of an unchanging friend. If there is anyone on earth who ought to be happy, it is the Christian.<p>2. The Christian should so live as to leave on others the impression that religion produces happiness. In our contact with our friends, we should show them that religion does not cause sadness or gloom, sourness or misanthropy, but that it produces cheerfulness, contentment, and peace. This may be shown by the countenance, and by the whole demeanour - by a calm brow, and a benignant eye, and by a cheerful aspect. The internal peace of the soul should be evinced by every proper external expression. A Christian may thus be always doing good - for he is always doing good who leaves the impression on others that religion makes its possessors happy.<p>3. The nature of religion is almost always mistaken by the world. They suppose that it makes its possessors melancholy and sad. The reason is, not that they are told so by those who are religious, and not that even they can see anything in religion to produce misery, but because they have fixed their affections on certain things which they suppose to be essential to happiness, and which they suppose religion would require them to give up without substituting anything in their place. But never was there a greater mistake. Let them go and ask Christians, and they will obtain but one answer from them. It is, that they never knew what true happiness was until they found it in the Saviour. This question may be proposed to a Christian of any denomination, or in any land, and the answer will be uniformly the same. Why is it, then, that the mass of persons regard religion as adapted only to make them unhappy? Why will they not take the testimony of their friends in the case, and believe those whom they would believe on any other subject, when they declare that it is only true religion that ever gives them solid peace?<p>4. We cannot depend on any external advantages of birth or blood for salvation; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-4.htm">Philippians 3:4-6</a>. Few or no persons have as much in this respect to rely on as Paul had. Indeed, if salvation were to be obtained at all by such external advantages, it is impossible to conceive that more could have been united in one case than there was in his. He had not only the advantage of having been born a Hebrew; of having been early trained in the Jewish religion; of being instructed in the ablest manner, but also the advantage of entire blamelessness in his moral deportment. He had showed in every way possible that he was heartily attached to the religion of his fathers, and he began life with a zeal in the cause which seemed to justify the warmest expectations of his friends. But all this was renounced, when he came to see the true method of salvation, and saw the better way by which eternal life is to be obtained.<p>And if Paul could not depend on this, we cannot safely do it. It will not save us that we have been born in the church; that we have had pious parents; that we were early baptized and consecrated to God; that we were trained in the Sunday school. Nor will it save us that we attend regularly on the place of worship, or that we are amiable, correct, honest, and upright in our lives. We can no more depend on these things than Saul of Tarsus could, and if all his eminent advantages failed to give him a solid ground of hope, our advantages will be equally vain in regard to our salvation. It almost seems as if God designed in the case of Saul of Tarsus, that there should be one instance where every possible external advantage for salvation should be found, and there should be everything that people ever could rely on in moral character, in order to show that no such things could be sufficient to save the soul. All these may exist, and yet there may not be a particle of love to God, and the heart may be full of selfishness, pride, and ambition, as it was in his case.<p>5. Religion demands humility; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-7.htm">Philippians 3:7-8</a>. It requires us to renounce all dependence on our own merits, and to rely simply on the merits of another - the Lord Jesus Christ. If we are ever saved, we must be brought to esteem all the advantages which birth and blood and our own righteousness can bestow as worthless, and even vile, in the matter of justification. We shall not despise these things in themselves, nor shall we consider that vice is as desirable as virtue, nor that a bad temper is to be sought rather than an amiable disposition, nor that dishonesty is as commendable as honesty; but we shall feel that in comparison with the merits of the Redeemer all these are worthless. But the mind is not brought to this condition without great humiliation. Nothing but the power of God can bring a proud and haughty and self-righteous sinner to this state, where he is willing to renounce all dependence on his own merits, and to be saved in the same way as the vilest of the species.<p>6. Let us seek to obtain an interest in the righteousness of the Redeemer; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm">Philippians 3:9</a>. Our own righteousness cannot save us. But in him there is enough. There is all that we want, and if we have that righteousness which is by faith, we have all that is needful to render us accepted with God, and to prepare us for heaven. When there is such a way of salvation - so easy, so free, so glorious, so ample for all, how unwise is anyone to rest on his own works, and to expect to be saved by what he has done! The highest honor of man is to be saved by the merits of the Son of God, and he has reached the most elevated rank in the human condition who has the most certain hope of salvation through him.<p>7. There is enough to be gained to excite us to the utmost diligence and effort in the Christian life; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10-14</a>. If people can be excited to effort by the prospect of an earthly crown in a race or a game, how much more should we be urged forward by the prospect of the eternal prize! To seek to know the Redeemer; to be raised up from the degradation of sin to have part in the resurrection of the just: to obtain the prize of the high calling in heaven - to be made everlastingly happy and glorious there - what object was ever placed before the mind like this? What ardor should it excite that we may gain it! Surely, the hope of obtaining such a prize as is before the Christian, should call forth all our powers. The struggle will not be long. The race will soon be won. The victory will be glorious; the defeat would be overwhelming and awful. No one need fear that he can put forth too much effort to obtain the prize. It is worth every exertion, and we should never relax our efforts, or give over in despair.<p>8. Let us, like Paul, ever cherish an humble sense of our attainments in religion; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-12.htm">Philippians 3:12-13</a>. If Paul had not reached the point of perfection, it is not to be presumed that we have; if he could not say that he had "attained," it is presumption in us to suppose that we have, if he had occasion for humiliation, we have more; if he felt that he was far short of the object which he sought, and was pressed down with the consciousness of imperfection, such a feeling becomes us also. Yet let us not sink down in despondency and inaction. Like him, let us strain every nerve that we may overcome our imperfections and win the prize. That prize is before us. It is glorious. We may be sensible that we, as yet, have not reached it, but if we will strive to obtain it, it will soon be certainly ours. We may feel that we are far distant from it now in the degree of our attainments, but we are not far from it in fact. It will be but a short period before the Christian will lay hold on that immortal crown, and before his brow will be encircled with the diadem of glory. For the race of life, whether we win or lose, is soon run; and when a Christian begins a day, he knows not but he may end it in heaven; when he lies down on his bed at night, he knows not but he may awake with the "prize" in his hand, and with the diadem of glory sparkling on his brow.<p>9. Our thoughts should be much in heaven; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>. Our home is there, our citizenship is there. Here we are strangers and pilgrims. We are away from home, in a cold and unfriendly world. Our great interests are in the skies; our eternal dwelling is to be there; our best friends are already there. There is our glorious Saviour with a body adapted to those pure abodes, and there are many whom we have loved on earth already with him. They are happy now, and we should not love them less because they are in heaven. Since, therefore, our great interests are there, and our best friends there; and since we ourselves are citizens of that heavenly world, our best affections should be there.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Greek, "Who shall transfigure the body of our humiliation (namely, in which our humiliation has place, 2Co 4:10; Eph 2:19; 2Ti 2:12), that it may be conformed unto the body of His glory (namely, in which His glory is manifested), according to the effectual working whereby," &c. Not only shall He come as our "Saviour," but also as our Glorifier.<p>even&#8212;not only to make the body like His own, but "to subdue all things," even death itself, as well as Satan and sin. He gave a sample of the coming transfiguration on the mount (Mt 17:1, &c.). Not a change of identity, but of fashion or form (Ps 17:15; 1Co 15:51). Our spiritual resurrection now is the pledge of our bodily resurrection to glory hereafter (Php 3:20; Ro 8:11). As Christ's glorified body was essentially identical with His body of humiliation; so our resurrection bodies as believers, since they shall be like His, shall be identical essentially with our present bodies, and yet "spiritual bodies" (1Co 15:42-44). Our "hope" is, that Christ, by His rising from the dead, hath obtained the power, and is become the pattern, of our resurrection (Mic 2:13).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who shall change our vile body; </span> who shall transform the body of our humility, or our lowliness, i.e. our lowbrought body, the singular for the plural, our humble and mean bodies, which depend upon and are beholden to our eating and drinking, and the actions which follow thereupon, that do humble and lower them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-48.htm" title="For he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from now on all generations shall call me blessed.">Luke 1:48</a></span>; now, it may be, languishing with pains, sickness, and many infirmities, perhaps cooped up in a noisome prison, and, it may be, an unclean dungeon, sown in dishonour and weakness in the grave, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-43.htm" title="It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:">1 Corinthians 15:43</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body; </span> that they may be conformed to Christ’s incorruptible, impassible, and immortal body, and so glorious, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,...">1 Corinthians 15:51-53</a></span>, in their proportion agreeing with the blessed body of our Lord when he shall appear, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_john/3-1.htm" title="Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knows us not, because it knew him not....">1Jo 3:1-3</a></span>, and they shall see him with the eyes of their bodies, made like unto his, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-26.htm" title="And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God:">Job 19:26</a>,27 Col 3:4</span>, not in equality, but only in respect of the same qualities that his body hath, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>,52 <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-17.htm" title="Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord.">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a></span>.

Which is defiled with sin, attended with frailty, and is mortal; and being dead, is sown and laid in the grave in corruption, weakness, and dishonour: in the Greek text it is, "the body of our humility"; sin has subjected the body to weakness, mortality, and death; and death brings it into a very low estate indeed, which is very humbling and mortifying to the pride and vanity man: now this vile body, in the resurrection morn, shall be stripped of all its vileness, baseness, and meanness; and be changed, not as to its substance, nor as to its form and figure, which shall always remain same, as did the substance and form of our Lord's body after his resurrection; but as to its qualities, it shall be changed from corruption to incorruption, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-42.htm">1 Corinthians 15:42</a>, from mortality to immortality, from weakness to power, from dishonour to glory, and be free from all sin: so the Jews say (b), that "the evil imagination, or corruption of nature, goes along with man in the hour of death, but does not return with him when the dead arise: <p>and this change will be made by the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ, when he shall descend from heaven; who as he is the pledge, the first fruits, the exemplar, and meritorious cause, so he will be the efficient cause of the resurrection of the saints; who will be raised and changed by him, by his power, and by virtue of union to him: <p>that it might be fashioned like unto his glorious body; or "the body of his glory", as it is now in heaven, and of which his transfiguration on the mount was an emblem and pledge; for glory, power, incorruption, and immortality, the bodies of the saints in the resurrection shall be like to Christ's, though not equal to it, and shall shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The Jews (c) have a notion, that "the holy blessed God will beautify the bodies of the righteous in future time, like the beauty of the first Adam: <p>but their beauty and glory will be greater than that, it will be like the glory of the second Adam, the Lord from heaven, whose image they shall then bear: and whereas this requires almighty power, of which Christ is possessed, it will be done <p>according to the working, the energy of his power and might; or as the Syriac version renders it, "according to his great power"; which was put forth in raising himself from the dead, and whereby he was declared to be the Son of God: and <p>whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself; not only sin, Satan, and the world, but death and the grave; and so consequently able to raise the dead bodies of his saints, and to change the qualities of them, and make them like unto his own: and now who would but follow such persons, who are citizens of heaven, have their conversation there, look for Christ the Saviour from thence, <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>, who when he comes will raise the dead in Christ first, put such a glory on their bodies as is on his own, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-16.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, and take them to himself, that where he is they may be also? see , <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-12.htm">Hebrews 6:12</a>. <p>(b) Midrash Tillim apud Galatin. de Arcan.

Perhaps, however, the compound of <span class="greekheb">σχῆμα</span> has in view the fact that only the fashion or figure in which the personality is clothed will be transformed.

It is found in Plato and Aristotle in its strict sense. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> also 4Ma 9:22.

The expression must apply esp[10]. to the unfitness of the present bodily nature to fulfil the claims of the spiritual life. It is pervaded by fleshly lusts; it is doomed to decay. <span class="greekheb">ταπειν</span>. is plainly suggested by <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> which follows. <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> is “pure form which may have the most diverse content. Here, on earth, <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> = <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>” (see an illuminating discussion by F. Köstlin, <span class="ital">Jahrb. f. deutsche Th.</span>, 1877, p. 279 ff.). Holst. (<span class="ital">Paulin. Th.</span>, p. 10) notes that for this conception of <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> as “organised matter,” the older Judaism had no word besides <span class="greekheb">בָּשָׂד</span>. Later Hellenistic Judaism used the word <span class="greekheb">σῶμα</span> in its Pauline sense (see <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/9-15.htm" title="For the corruptible body presseth down the soul, and the earthy tabernacle weigheth down the mind that museth upon many things.">Wis 9:15</a>).—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ γ</span>. <span class="greekheb">α</span>. is to be omitted with the best authorities. See crit. note <span class="ital">supr.</span>—<span class="greekheb">σύμμορφον</span> is used proleptically as its position shows. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm" title="To the end he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his saints.">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">στηρίξαι τὰς καρδίας ὑμῶν ἀμέμπτους</span>. Perhaps the compound of <span class="greekheb">μορφή</span> is used to remind them of the completeness of their future assimilation to Christ. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-29.htm" title="For whom he did foreknow, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.">Romans 8:29</a>. The end of the enumeration in that passage is <span class="greekheb">ἐδόξασεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is the climax here.—<span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σώμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">δόξης α</span>. With Paul <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span> is always the outward expression of the spiritual life (<span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>). It is, if one may so speak, the semblance of the Divine life in heaven. The Divine <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> will ultimately reveal itself in all who have received it as <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>. That is what the N.T. writers mean by the completed, perfected “likeness to Christ”. This passage, combined with <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-35.htm" title="But some man will say, How are the dead raised up? and with what body do they come?...">1 Corinthians 15:35-50</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-16.htm" title="For which cause we faint not; but though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.">2 Corinthians 4:16</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-5.htm" title="Now he that has worked us for the selfsame thing is God, who also has given to us the earnest of the Spirit.">2 Corinthians 5:5</a>, gives us the deepest insight we have into Paul’s idea of the transition from the present life to the future. He only speaks in detail of that which awaits believers. Whether they die before the Parousia or survive till then, a change will take place in them. But this is not arbitrary. It is illustrated by the sowing of seed. The Divine <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> which they have received will work out for them a <span class="greekheb">σῶμα πνευματικόν</span>. Their renewed nature will be clothed with a corresponding body through the power of Christ who is Himself the source of their spiritual life. The <span class="greekheb">σῶμα σαρκικόν</span> must perish: that is the fate of <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. If there be no <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span>, and thus no <span class="greekheb">σῶμα πνευματικόν</span>, the end is destruction. But the <span class="greekheb">σῶμα πνευματικόν</span> is precisely that in which Christ rose from the dead and in which He now lives. Its outward semblance is <span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>, a glory which shone forth upon Paul from the risen Christ on the Damascus road, which he could never forget. Hence all in whom Christ has operated as <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα ζωοποιοῦν</span> will be “changed into the same likeness from glory (<span class="greekheb">δόξα</span>) to glory”. Paul does not here reflect on the time when the transformation takes place. That is of little moment to him. The fact is his supreme consolation. On the whole discussion see esp[11].

Its use here implies that, in a sense, the change would be superficial. Already, in the “new creation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-17.htm" title="Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.">2 Corinthians 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-15.htm" title="For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.">Galatians 6:15</a>) of the saint the essentials of the glorified being are present. Even for the body the pledge and reason of its glory is present where the Holy indwelling Spirit is, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-11.htm" title="But if the Spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwells in you.">Romans 8:11</a>). And thus the final transfiguration will be, so to speak, a change of “accidents,” not of “essence.” “<span class="ital">Now are we</span> the sons of God; and it doth not yet appear what we shall be” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm" title="Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it does not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.">1 John 3:2</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">our vile body</span>] Lit., and far better, <span class="bld">the body of our humiliation</span>. Wyclif has “whiche schal refourme the bodi of oure mekenesse”; the Rhemish version, “the body of our humilitie”; Beza’s Latin version, <span class="ital">corpus nostrum humile</span>; Luther, <span class="ital">unsern nichtigen Leib</span>. All paraphrases here involve loss or mistake. The body transfigured by the returning Lord is the body “of our humiliation” as being, in its present conditions, inseparably connected with the burthens and limitations of earth; demanding, for its sustenance and comfort, a large share of the energies of the spirit, and otherwise hindering the spirit’s action in many directions. Not because it is material, for the glorified body, though “spiritual” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>), will not <span class="ital">be spirit;</span> but because of the mysterious effect of man’s having fallen <span class="ital">as an embodied spirit</span>. The body is thus seen here, in its present condition, to be rather the “humbling” body than “vile” (Lat., <span class="ital">vilis</span>, “<span class="ital">cheap</span>”), “humble.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe meanwhile that peculiar mystery and glory of the Gospel, a promise of eternal being and blessedness for <span class="ital">the body</span> of the saint. To the ancient philosopher, the body was merely the prison of the spirit; to the Apostle, it is its counterpart, destined to share with it, in profound harmony, the coming heaven. Not its essential nature, but its distorted condition in the Fall, makes it now the clog of the renewed spirit; it shall hereafter be its wings. This is to take place, as the N.T. consistently reveals, not at death, but at the Return of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The bearing of this passage on the error of the libertine, who “sinned against his own body” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-18.htm" title="Flee fornication.

A foresight of what it now is was given at the Transfiguration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-2.htm" title="And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.">Matthew 17:2</a>, and parallels); and St Paul had had a moment’s glimpse of it as it is, at his Conversion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-3.htm" title="And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven:">Acts 9:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-17.htm" title="And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, even Jesus, that appeared to you in the way as you came, has sent me, that you might receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.">Acts 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-14.htm" title="And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know his will, and see that Just One, and should hear the voice of his mouth.">Acts 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-1.htm" title="Am I not an apostle? am I not free? have I not seen Jesus Christ our Lord? are not you my work in the Lord?">1 Corinthians 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-8.htm" title="And last of all he was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.">1 Corinthians 15:8</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[25] The Ascension may well have been, as many theologians have held, a further glorification, the crown of mysterious processes carried on through the Forty Days.

But this latter is of course deeply implied here. The sensual heresies which the Apostle is dealing with lead him to this exclusive view of the glorious future of the saint’s body.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is plain from this passage, as from others (see esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-42.htm" title="So also is the resurrection of the dead.

But when we have said this, our certainties in the question cease, lost in the mysterious problems of the nature of matter. The Blessed will be “the same,” body as well as spirit; truly continuous, in their whole being, in full identity, with the pilgrims of time. But no one can say that to this identity will be necessary the presence in the glorified body of any given particle, or particles, of the body of humiliation, any more than in the mortal body it is necessary to its identity (as far as we know) that any particle, or particles, present in youth should be also present in old age. However, in the light of the next words this question may be left in peace.

The “<span class="ital">working</span>” is the positive putting forth of the always present “<span class="ital">ability</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even to subdue all things unto himself</span>] “<span class="ital">Even</span>” precedes and intensifies the whole following thought.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Elsewhere <span class="ital">the Father</span> appears as “subduing all enemies,” “all things,” to the Son.

And through this great victory of the Son, the Father will be supremely glorified. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-28.htm" title="And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.">1 Corinthians 15:28</a>; a prediction beyond our full understanding, but which on the one hand does <span class="ital">not</span> mean that in the eternal Future the Throne will cease to be “the throne of God and <span class="ital">of the Lamb</span>” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-1.htm" title="And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.">Revelation 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-3.htm" title="And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:">Revelation 22:3</a>), and on the other points to an infinitely developed manifestation in eternity of the glory of the Father in the Son.

He had already told us (ver. 10) that the Christian soul is being gradually conformed during life unto the death of Christ. He now tells us that this conformity of the Christian unto Christ is ultimately to extend to the body. The Lord shall change the outward fashion of our body; but this change will be more than a change of outward fashion: it will result in a real conformity of the resurrection-body of the believer unto the glorious body of the Lord. <span class="accented">The body of our humiliation</span>; not "vile body." St. Paul does not despise the body, like the Stoics and Gnostics; the Christian's body is a sacred thing - it is the temple of the Holy Ghost, and the seed of the resurrection-body (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-20.htm">1 Corinthians 6:20</a>). <span class="cmt_word">According to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself</span>.

Lightfoot observes that the A.V. seems to countenance the stoic contempt of the body. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-22.htm">Colossians 1:22</a>. The biographer of Archbishop Whately relates that, during his last illness, one of his chaplains, watching, during the night at his bedside, in making some remark expressive of sympathy for his sufferings, quoted these words: "Who shall change our vile body." The Archbishop interrupted him with the request "Read the words." The chaplain read them from the English Bible; but he reiterated, "Read his own words." The chaplain gave the literal translation, "this body of our humiliation." "That's right, interrupted the Archbishop, "not vile - nothing that He made is vile."<p>That it may be fashioned like (&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;).<p>The words that it may be, or become, are omitted from the correct Greek text, so that the strict rendering is the body of our humiliation conformed, etc. The words are, however, properly inserted in A.V. and Rev. for the sake of perspicuity. Rev., correctly, conformed for fashioned like. Fashion belongs to the preceding verb. See on shall change. The adjective conformed is compounded with &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#769; form (see on <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/2-6.htm">Philippians 2:6</a>, and see on made conformable, <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-10.htm">Philippians 3:10</a>). As the body of Christ's glory is a spiritual body, this word is appropriate to describe a conformation to what is more essential, permanent, and characteristic. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-35.htm">1 Corinthians 15:35-53</a>.<p>His glorious body (&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#837;&#834; &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>Wrong. Rev., correctly, the body of His glory. The body in which He appears in His present glorified state. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-9.htm">Colossians 2:9</a>.<p>The working whereby He is able (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Lit., the energy of His being able. &#x394;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; expresses ability, faculty, natural ability, not necessarily manifest. &#x395;&#788;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1; is power in exercise, used only of superhuman power. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-12.htm">John 1:12</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-11.htm">2 Peter 2:11</a>. Hence, as Calvin remarks, "Paul notes not only the power of God as it resides in Him, but the power as it puts itself into act." See <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-19.htm">Ephesians 1:19</a>, where four of the six words for power are used.<p>Subdue (&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Rev., subject. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-7.htm">James 4:7</a>. It is more than merely subdue. It is to bring all things within His divine economy; to marshal them all under Himself in the new heaven and the new earth in which shall dwell righteousness. Hence the perfected heavenly state as depicted by John is thrown into the figure of a city, an organized commonwealth. The verb is thus in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-20.htm">Philippians 3:20</a>. The work of God in Christ is therefore not only to transform, but to subject, and that not only the body, but all things. See <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-25.htm">1 Corinthians 15:25-27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-19.htm">Romans 8:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-20.htm">Romans 8:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-10.htm">Ephesians 1:10</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-21.htm">Ephesians 1:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-22.htm">Ephesians 1:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-10.htm">Ephesians 4:10</a>. </body></html>
