He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/philippians/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I press toward the mark - As he who was running a race did. The "mark" means properly the object set up at a distance at which one looks or aims, and hence the goal, or post which was set up at the end of a race-course, and which was to be reached in order that the prize might be won. Here it means that which is at the end of the Christian race - in heaven.<p>For the prize - The prize of the racer was a crown or garland of olive, laurel, pine, or apple; see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm">1 Corinthians 9:24</a>. The prize of the Christian is the crown that is incorruptible in heaven.<p>Of the high calling of God - Which is the end or result of that calling. God has called us to great and noble efforts; to a career of true honor and glory; to the obtainment of a bright and imperishable crown. It is a calling which is "high," or "upward" - (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;  ano&#772;) - that is, which tends to the skies. The calling of the Christian is from heaven, and to heaven; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/15-24.htm">Proverbs 15:24</a>. He has been summoned by God through the gospel of the Lord Jesus to secure the crown. It is placed before and above him in heaven. It may be his, if he will not faint or tire or look backward. It demands his highest efforts, and it is worth all the exertions which a mortal can make even in the longest life. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/philippians/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. high calling&#8212;literally, "the calling that is above" (Ga 4:26; Col 3:1): "the heavenly calling" (Heb 3:1).

"The high," or "heavenly calling," is not restricted, as Alford thinks, to Paul's own calling as an apostle by the summons of God from heaven; but the common calling of all Christians to salvation in Christ, which coming from heaven invites us to heaven, whither accordingly our minds ought to be uplifted.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/philippians/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I press toward the mark; </span> he did not look back, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-62.htm" title="And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.">Luke 9:62</a></span>, nor was lazy, but did follow hard, with an eager pursuit, <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-12.htm" title="And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.">Matthew 11:12</a></span>}</span> after the perfection that was in his eye; not erring from, his main scope; considering what he had received was but in part, he did still press for more, upon that ground that Christ had apprehended him for more, as if he were stretching out his hands to lay hold of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus; </span> trusting he should, through grace, be kept all along, maugre all difficulties, in the hand of Christ, till upon his account he should be fully possessed of all that was aimed at, even that which is styled the prize, or victorious palm of our high calling; and the Christians’ may well be termed a high calling, considering their heavenly birth when called, and laid hold of by Christ, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-13.htm" title="Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.">John 1:13</a></span>, and the purchased inheritance eternally settled upon such spiritual, high-born princes, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-14.htm" title="Which is the earnest of our inheritance until the redemption of the purchased possession, to the praise of his glory.">Ephesians 1:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-6.htm" title="And has made us kings and priests to God and his Father; to him be glory and dominion for ever and ever.

The allusion is to the white line, or mark, which the runners in the Olympic games made up to, and to which he that came first received the prize; and by which the apostle intends the Lord Jesus Christ, who is  "the scope", or "mark", of all the thoughts, purposes, and counsels of God, to which they all aim, and in which they all centre; and of the covenant of grace of which he is the sum and substance, the Mediator, surety, and messenger, in whom are all the blessings and promises of it; and of the Scriptures of truth, the writings of the Old and New Testament, which all testify of him, and agree in him; and of both law and Gospel, he is the end of the law, and the substance of the Gospel; and of all the graces of the Spirit, in the hearts of his people, faith looks at him, hope is concerned with him, and love has him for its object; and of all the duties believers are concerned in, they all point at him, they are done in his name and strength, through faith in him, and from a principle of love to him, and with a view to his glory; and so he is of their thoughts, affections, and desires: and to this mark they press, or "run", as the Syriac version renders it; they look to Jesus, while they are running their Christian race; they keep him in their view, and follow after him, because he is their forerunner, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-20.htm">Hebrews 6:20</a>, and the Captain of their salvation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-10.htm">Hebrews 2:10</a>; they set him before them as their guide to direct them, according to whom they steer their course, that so they may not lose their way, nor move out of it, to the right hand or the left; and from whom they take great encouragement to go on, and press through the difficulties they do; and besides, they know that there is no coming at the prize, but through the mark, for there is salvation in no other, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-12.htm">Acts 4:12</a>; and that whoever comes up to the mark, or believes in Christ, shall enjoy the prize of eternal life, which is next mentioned: <p>for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus: by which is meant, the incorruptible crown; the crown of life, righteousness, and glory, that fadeth not away, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm">James 1:12</a>, styled "the prize of the calling of God"; because it is what God in the effectual calling calls his people to, even to a kingdom and glory, and to eternal glory and happiness; of which they have a sight, though but a glimmering view of it, and are blessed with hope in it; in which they rejoice, and see their right unto it, in the righteousness of Christ, and have a meetness for it: this is named "the high calling of God", because God is on high, who calls them to it, in allusion to the judge in the Olympic games, who was placed in an exalted situation, near the mark, with the crown in his hand, which he gave to him that came first; and because the grace by which the saints are called is from above, as every good and perfect gift is, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-17.htm">James 1:17</a>; and because the prize they are called unto consists of things above, where Jesus is, and is the hope laid up in heaven, <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5</a>, and the inheritance reserved there, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-4.htm">1 Peter 1:4</a>; and expresses the great honour and dignity of called ones, who are called to a crown and kingdom, are raised from the dunghill, to sit among princes, and to inherit the throne of glory, and are made kings and priests unto God: and may also denote, that the calling to such high honour is from above, and not below; and is owing to the special grace and favour of God, and not to any merits of men; nor is the prize to which they are called, of him that willeth and runneth, but of God's grace and mercy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/9-16.htm">Romans 9:16</a>, and moreover, this calling is said to be "in Christ Jesus"; for both the purpose and grace, according to which men are called, are in him; the grace by which they are called, and which is implanted in them when called, is all in and from Christ; the blessings of grace, which they then in person enjoy, are spiritual blessings in him; and even the glory they are called unto is in his hands; not only the promise of eternal life, but that itself; the gift of it is with him, and it comes through him; yea, they are called by him, and said to be the called of Christ Jesus; now the prize of this calling, which is what God has prepared from all eternity, which Christ has in his hands, and will give to all his, and which is of immense richness and eternal duration, and shall be bestowed on all Christian runners, or true believers, is what the apostle was pressing for, pursuing after, with much difficulty, through great toil and labour, diligent searching of the Scriptures, frequent wrestling with God in prayer, and constant attendance on the means of grace, and ordinances of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/philippians/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/philippians/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-14.htm" title="I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.">Php 3:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">κατὰ σκ</span>. “In the direction of the mark.” Exactly parallel is <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm" title="And the angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south to the way that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza, which is desert.">Acts 8:26</a>, <span class="greekheb">πορεύου κατὰ μεσημβρίαν</span>.

It is needless to distinguish between <span class="greekheb">σκοπόν</span> and <span class="greekheb">βραβεῖον</span> in the Apostle’s thought. Both really point to that unbroken and complete fellowship with Christ which is attained through the power of His resurrection, that resurrection being the condition of the believer’s victory over sin and death, and making it possible for him to enter the “house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens”. The purified life in heaven is, in a word, both the goal and the prize. Contrast with this exulting thought <span class="ital">Omar Khayyám</span>, xxxviii.: “The stars are setting and the caravan starts for the dawn of nothing”.—<span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ βραβ</span>. The word occurs in Comedy, Inscrr[1]. and N.T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize?

It is possibly one of those words which must have been common in colloquial Greek (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the frequent use of <span class="greekheb">βραβεύς</span>), but have survived only in a few books. <span class="greekheb">εἰς</span> must be read with the best authorities, for, as Lft[2]. notes, “the prize marks the position of the goal”. <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span> is an explanatory gloss.—<span class="greekheb">τῆς ἄνω κλ</span>. “The upward calling.” The Apostle seems to mean that the <span class="greekheb">βραβεῖον</span> is the <span class="greekheb">ἄνω κλῆσις</span> (so also Lips[3].). <span class="greekheb">κλῆσις</span> is the technical word in the Epistles for that decisive appeal of God to the soul which is made in Jesus Christ: the offer of salvation. Those who listen are designated <span class="greekheb">κλητοί</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-30.htm" title="Moreover whom he did predestinate, them he also called: and whom he called, them he also justified: and whom he justified, them he also glorified.">Romans 8:30</a> and Hltzm[4]., <span class="ital">N.T. Th.</span>, ii., p. 165 ff. This <span class="greekheb">κλ</span>. is not merely to “the inheritance of the saints in light”. Its effect must be seen in the sanctification of the believer’s life on earth. But here the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἄνω</span> suggests that the Apostle has before him the final issue of the calling which belongs to those who have endured to the end, who have run with patience the race set before them. The phrase seems to carry much the same meaning as <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm" title="Why, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus;">Hebrews 3:1</a>, <span class="greekheb">κλήσεως ἐπουρανίου</span>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the suggestive comment of Chr[5]., <span class="greekheb">τοὺς μάλιστα τιμωμένους τῶν ἀθλητῶν καὶ τῶν ἡνιόχων οὐ στεφανοῦσιν ἐν τῷ σταδίῳ κάτω</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἄνω καλέσας ὁ βασιλεὺς ἐκεῖ στεφανοῖ</span>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐν Χ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἰ</span>. Although it would give a satisfactory sense to take these words with <span class="greekheb">διώκω</span> (so <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, Myr[6]., Ws[7].), it is far more natural to join them closely with <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄνω κλ</span>.

The verse might be roughly but closely rendered, “mark-wards I haste, towards the prize &c.”; I run with a definite aim, and that aim is to win the prize. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-26.htm" title="I therefore so run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beats the air:">1 Corinthians 9:26</a>; “I so run, not as <span class="ital">uncertainly</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the prize</span>] The same word occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-24.htm" title="Know you not that they which run in a race run all, but one receives the prize?

It is very rare in secular Greek, but is connected with the common word for the arbiter or umpire who awarded the athletic prize. In Christian Latin (e.g. in the Latin versions here) it appears transliterated, as <span class="ital">bravium</span> (or <span class="ital">brabium</span>). The “prize” is “the crown,” glory everlasting as the blessed result and triumph of the work of grace, of the life of faith. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a>; and esp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:...">2 Timothy 4:7-8</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the high calling</span>] Lit., “<span class="ital">the upward</span>, or <span class="ital">upper calling</span>.” The Latin versions have <span class="ital">superior vocatio, superna vocatio</span>.

He is dealing with his own <span class="ital">spiritual experience</span> as a general model.—This “calling” is “celestial,” at once in origin, operation, and final issue. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/colossians/3-1.htm" title=" If you then be risen with Christ, seek those things which are above, where Christ sits on the right hand of God....">Colossians 3:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.">2 Thessalonians 2:14</a>.
