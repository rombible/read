It is also to be remembered that Hebron was a city of refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-13.htm" title="Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah with her suburbs,">Joshua 21:13</a>), and that here not even the “Goel” might slay the murderer without a trial (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/35-22.htm" title="But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast on him any thing without laying of wait,">Numbers 35:22-25</a>). The curse falls “on his father’s house,” since Abishai also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm" title="So Joab, and Abishai his brother slew Abner, because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle.">2Samuel 3:30</a>) had been concerned with him in the murder.<p>The phrase, “that leaneth on a staff,” has been understood by many as “holding a distaff,” <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>a person unfit for war. The word has the sense of “distaff” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-19.htm" title="She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.">Proverbs 31:19</a>, and is so rendered here by the Vulgate; but the sense given by the English—which is also that of the LXX. and Targum—is better, and more in accordance with the other particulars.<p>For “<span class= "ital">on </span>the sword” read “<span class= "ital">by </span>the sword,” there being no reference to the idea of suicide. On the violent end of Joab see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/2-31.htm" title="And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall on him, and bury him; that you may take away the innocent blood, which Joab shed, from me, and from the house of my father.">1Kings 2:31-34</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:22-39 Judgments are prepared for such scorners as Abner; but Joab, in what he did, acted wickedly. David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The curse of David proves that Joab was not justified as blood-revenger or Goel <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-27.htm">2 Samuel 3:27</a> in taking away Abner's life.<p>That leaneth on a staff - Rather, a crutch.

Joab came to the king, and said, What hast thou done?&#8212;Joab's knowledge of Abner's wily character might have led him to doubt the sincerity of that person's proposals and to disapprove the policy of relying on his fidelity. But undoubtedly there were other reasons of a private and personal nature which made Joab displeased and alarmed by the reception given to Abner. The military talents of that general, his popularity with the army, his influence throughout the nation, rendered him a formidable rival. In the event of his overtures being carried out, the important service of bringing over all the other tribes to the king of Judah would establish so strong a claim on the gratitude of David, that his accession would inevitably raise a serious obstacle to the ambition of Joab. To these considerations was added the remembrance of the blood feud that existed between them since the death of his brother Asahel (2Sa 2:23). Determined, therefore, to get Abner out of the way, Joab feigned some reason, probably in the king's name, for recalling him, and, going out to meet him, stabbed him unawares; not within Hebron, for it was a city of refuge, but at a noted well in the neighborhood.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let it rest, </span> i.e. this blood, the guilt and punishment of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And on all his father’s house.</span> But children were not to suffer for their parent’s sin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-16.htm" title="The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers: every man shall be put to death for his own sin.">Deu 24:16</a></span>; and therefore either this was only a prediction; or, if it were an imprecation, David may seem to have transgressed his bounds, and mingled his passion with his zeal, that so he might express his utter detestation of this horrid murder, and how far he was from having any hand in it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An issue</span> was not only a troublesome and shameful disease, but also infectious, both to him that had it, and to all that touched him; so that whilst it was upon a man, he was cut off in a great part from converse either with God or men. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That leaneth on a staff, </span> through craziness, or feebleness, or lameness, whereby he is rendered unfit for action and public service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let it rest on the head of Joab,....

The word translated <span class="ital">staff</span> means elsewhere <span class="ital">distaff</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/31-19.htm" title="She lays her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.">Proverbs 31:19</a>), and the phrase may also be rendered as it is in the Vulgate “distaff holder” (<span class="ital">tenens fusum</span>). This would signify ‘a weak, effeminate man, unfit for war,’ as “Hercules with the distaff” was the type of unmanly feebleness among the Greeks. But this explanation seems forced, and the E. V. is supported by the Sept. and Targum.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">that falleth on the sword</span>] Render, “<span class="bld">by</span> the sword.” The E.

The force of the expression thus indicates the great excitement under which David was labouring; yet even so it was no slight matter to utter so bitter a curse upon a man so powerful, and whose military skill was so essential to the maintenance of his throne. To a man of David's strong sense of justice, it was a small matter that by Abner's murder the kingdom of the ten tribes was lost perhaps forever; what he hated was the wickedness of this mean act of personal revenge. And thus his imprecations are all such as would be humiliating to a family so distinguished for great physical as well as mental gifts, as the house of Zeruiah. Nor was David content with this; for we gather from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-6.htm">1 Chronicles 11:6</a> that during the intervening years Joab was deprived of his office, and that he regained it only by an act of daring bravery. (For the miserable condition of one suffering with an issue, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-2.htm">Leviticus 15:2</a>, etc.; and for that of a leper, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13.htm">Leviticus 13, 14</a>.) <span class="cmt_word">Instead of one that leaneth on a staff,</span> some translate "a distaff holder," that is, a poor effeminate creature, fit only for woman's work. The true sense is probably a cripple - one who needs a crutch. <span class="cmt_word">That falleth on the sword;</span> more correctly the Revised Version, <span class="accented">that falleth by the sword.</span> The two last imprecations mean that if any of the race of Joab and Abishai escape these personal blemishes, yet that his fate shall be, in war an inglorious death, and in peace a life of poverty. This curse of David is regarded in the Talmud ('Sanhedr.,' 48.2) as very sinful. Undeniably it was uttered in violent anger, and while Joab's act was utterly base and perfidious, yet he had the excuse for it of Asahel's death and David's double-dealing. The latter made him conclude that the man who had killed his brother was also to usurp his place. Possibly this suspicion was not without reason. As David was strong enough to deprive Joab of his command, it is plain that he had nothing to fear from telling him his plans. Joab would have assented, the blood feud have been appeased by a money payment, and all gone well. But David, it seems, wished to hold Joab in check by giving at least a share in the command to the veteran Abner. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When Joab learned. Lit. they told him) that Abner had been with David, and he had sent him away again, he went to David to reproach him for having done so. "What hast thou done? Behold, Abner came to thee; why then hast thou sent him away, and he is gone quite away?" i.e., so that he could go away again without being detained (for this meaning of the inf. abs., see Ewald, 280, b.). "Thou knowest (or more correctly as a question, Dost thou know?) Abner, the son of Ner, that he came to persuade thee (i.e., to make thee certain of his intentions), and to learn thy going out and in (i.e., all thine undertakings), and to learn all that thou wilt do" (i.e., all thy plans). Joab hoped in this way to prejudice David against Abner, to make him suspected as a traitor, that he might then be able to gratify his own private revenge with perfect impunity.</body></html>
