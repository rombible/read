But it is to be remembered that she was not rightfully his wife, and that David’s claim was prior as well as better. According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm" title="But Saul had given Michal his daughter, David's wife, to Phalti the son of Laish, which was of Gallim.">1Samuel 25:44</a>, Phaltiel was of Gallim, a place thought, from the connection in which it is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-30.htm" title="Lift up your voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard to Laish, O poor Anathoth.">Isaiah 10:30</a>, to have been in Benjamin, and not far from Gibeah; but he had probably crossed the Jordan with the adherents of the house of Saul. Bahurim was on the road from the Mount of Olives to the Jordan valley, and hence on the way from Mahanaim to Hebron, and a long distance from the former. It was the residence of Shimei (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came.">2Samuel 16:5</a>), and the place of concealment of David’s messengers, Jonathan and Ahimaaz (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-18.htm" title="Nevertheless a lad saw them, and told Absalom: but they went both of them away quickly, and came to a man's house in Bahurim, which had a well in his court; where they went down.">2Samuel 17:18</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-21 Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are too proud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While men go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bahurim - Best known as the residence of Shimei, and as the place where Jonathan and Ahimaaz were concealed in a well on the occasion of David's flight from Absalom <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-5.htm">2 Samuel 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-18.htm">2 Samuel 17:18</a>.

Abner sent messengers to David&#8212;Though his language implied a secret conviction, that in supporting Ish-bosheth he had been laboring to frustrate the divine purpose of conferring the sovereignty of the kingdom on David, this acknowledgment was no justification either of the measure he was now adopting, or of the motives that prompted it. Nor does it seem possible to uphold the full integrity and honor of David's conduct in entertaining his secret overtures for undermining Ish-bosheth, except we take into account the divine promise of the kingdom, and his belief that the secession of Abner was a means designed by Providence for accomplishing it. The demand for the restoration of his wife Michal was perfectly fair; but David's insisting on it at that particular moment, as an indispensable condition of his entering into any treaty with Abner, seems to have proceeded not so much from a lingering attachment as from an expectation that his possession of her would incline some adherents of the house of Saul to be favorable to his cause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bahurim; </span> a city of Benjamin, upon the borders of Judah.

It belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, and was on the road from Jerusalem over the Mount of Olives to the Jordan fords. A Jewish tradition in the Targum identifies it with Almon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-18.htm" title="Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four cities.">Joshua 21:18</a>), now <span class="ital">Almît</span>, about 4 miles N.E. of Jerusalem, and a mile beyond Anathoth (<span class="ital">Anâta</span>). According to this view, which is adopted by Lieut. Conder, it was not on the main road through Bethany, but on a road which leads across the saddle north of the principal summit of the Mount of Olives.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Her husband went with her along weeping behind her.</span> "Along weeping" is a very awkward rendering of the Hebrew phrase, "going and weeping." The Revised Version is far better, "weeping as he went and followed her." Phaltiel had been Michal's husband for eight or nine years, and his sorrow at losing her excites sympathy for them both. They had evidently loved one another, and she was now going to be but one of many wives; and though David may have desired her restoration because he valued her and cherished the remembrance of their youthful affection, yet there was a large admixture of political motive in his conduct. At Gallim she had been Phaltiel's one jewel, and had been loved for her own sake; at Hebron she would have many rivals. But women of royal rank have often to pay the price of sacrificed affections for the ends of statecraft. Near <span class="cmt_word">Bahurim</span>, on the road from Jerusalem to Gilgal, in the valley of the Jordan, the convoy approached the borders of Judah, and Abner will not allow the weeping husband to enter David's dominions. Painful as was his fate, he had himself done wrong in marrying another man's wife; and if he was weeping now, we may well believe that David had felt equal anguish when Michal was torn from him and sold to another, - for fathers in those days received instead of giving a dowry upon the marriage of their daughters. Saul in this matter was most to blame, and if he had not committed this wrong, David might never have sought an evil solace in multiplying to himself other wives <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"God do so to Abner, ... as Jehovah hath sworn to David, so will I do to him." The repetition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; serves to introduce the oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-27.htm">2 Samuel 2:27</a>. "To take away the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beersheba." We do not know of any oath with which God had promised the kingdom to David; but the promise of God in itself is equivalent to an oath, as God is the true God, who can neither lie nor deceive (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm">1 Samuel 15:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm">Numbers 23:19</a>).
