David laid Abner's murder deeply to heart, and in many ways expressed his detestation of it. The guilt of blood brings a curse upon families: if men do not avenge it, God will. It is a sad thing to die like a fool, as they do that any way shorten their own days, and those who make no provision for another world. Who would be fond of power, when a man may have the name of it, and must be accountable for it, yet is hampered in the use of it? David ought to have done his duty, and then trusted God with the issue. Carnal policy spared Joab. The Son of David may long delay, but never fails to punish impenitent sinners. He who now reigns upon the throne of David, has a kingdom of a nobler kind. Whatever He doeth, is noticed by all his willing people, and is pleasing to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To eat meat ... - Fasting was a sign of the deepest mourning <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-12.htm">2 Samuel 1:12</a>.

As Abner had stabbed Asahel in open war [2Sa 2:23], Joab had not the right of the Goel. Besides, he had adopted a lawless and execrable method of obtaining satisfaction (see on [258]1Ki 2:5). The deed was an insult to the authority, as well as most damaging to the prospects of the king. But David's feelings and conduct on hearing of the death, together with the whole character and accompaniments of the funeral solemnity, tended not only to remove all suspicion of guilt from him, but even to turn the tide of popular opinion in his favor, and to pave the way for his reigning over all the tribes more honorably than by the treacherous negotiations of Abner.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Took notice of it; </span> observed what the king said and did.

The meaning is, by his carriage herein he gained so great an interest in the hearts of his people, that they judged most favourably of, and put the best construction upon, all his words and actions; as, on the contrary, when people have a prejudice against or an ill will towards their prince, they are apt to judge most harshly of all his counsels and doings. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And all the people took notice of it,....

The people would have been grieved and astonished if David had been guilty of this mean murder; but his indignant disavowal of it was in accordance with his usual justice and uprightness, and so it confirmed their high opinion of him. Thus while the more distant tribes condemned David, those who had the best opportunity for forming a judgment gave their verdict in his favour. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David heard this, he said, "I and my kingdom are innocent before Jehovah for ever of the blood of Abner.

To make the reason for this fearful curse perfectly clear, the historian observes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-30.htm">2 Samuel 3:30</a>, that Joab and his brother Abishai had murdered Abner, "because he had slain their brother Asahel at Gibeon in the battle" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-23.htm">2 Samuel 2:23</a>). This act of Joab, in which Abishai must have been in some way concerned, was a treacherous act of assassination, which could not even be defended as blood-revenge, since Abner had slain Asahel in battle after repeated warnings, and only for the purpose of saving his own life. The principal motive for Joab's act was the most contemptible jealousy, or the fear lest Abner's reconciliation to David should diminish his own influence with the king, as was the case again at a later period with the murder of Amasa (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-10.htm">2 Samuel 20:10</a>).</body></html>
