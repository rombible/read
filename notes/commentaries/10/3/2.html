(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:">1Samuel 14:49-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm" title="And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.">2Samuel 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm" title="And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of the LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round about.">1Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm" title="And Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty and one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD did choose out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was Naamah an Ammonitess.">1Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm" title="Three years reigned he in Jerusalem. and his mother's name was Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom.">1Kings 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm" title="And in the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel reigned Asa over Judah.">1Kings 15:9</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">Amnon.</span>—Written “Aminon” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-20.htm" title="And Absalom her brother said to her, Has Amnon your brother been with you? but hold now your peace, my sister: he is your brother; regard not this thing. So Tamar remained desolate in her brother Absalom's house.">2Samuel 13:20</a>. His great crime and miserable end are related in 2 Samuel 13.<p><span class= "bld">Chileab.</span>—Called “Daniel” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Now these were the sons of David, which were born to him in Hebron; the firstborn Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess; the second Daniel, of Abigail the Carmelitess:">1Chronicles 3:1</a>. None of the attempts to explain these as two forms of the same name have been successful. Either, therefore, “Chileab” is an error of the scribe (all but the first letter being the same as the first three letters of the following word), or, more probably, Chileab had a double name. Nothing further is known of him, and as he does not appear in the subsequent troubles, it is supposed that he died early. These two sons were born of the wives whom David had taken while an outlaw.<p><span class= "bld">Absalom.</span>—His history, rebellion, and death are narrated in 2 Samuel 13-18. His mother was “the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur,” a petty province north-east of Bashan. How David was brought into connection with him, and whether this alliance had any political object or not, we are not told, but the fact that Absalom in his exile naturally sought refuge with his maternal grandmother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm" title="But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day.">2Samuel 13:37</a>) may have had a connection with David’s subsequent campaigns in that region.<p><span class= "bld">Adonijah.</span>—After the death of his three elder brothers, Adonijah considered himself the rightful heir to the throne, and embittered the last days of his father by a rebellion (1 Kings 1). He was at last put to death by Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-25.htm" title="And king Solomon sent by the hand of Benaiah the son of Jehoiada; and he fell on him that he died.">1Kings 2:25</a>).<p>Of the other two sons, Shephatiah and Ithream, and of the mothers of the last three, nothing is known, although there is an absurd Jewish tradition that “Eglah” was another name for “Michal.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-2.htm" title="And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;...">2 Samuel 3:2-3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Unto David sons were born of Ahinoam — </span>He had no children, it seems, by this wife during his exile; or if he had, they were daughters. <span class="ital">The daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur — </span>A part of Syria, northward from the land of Israel. How David came by this wife it is not easy to say. Perhaps he married her out of policy, that he might have a powerful friend and ally in her father, to assist him against Ish-bosheth’s party in the north, while himself opposed them in the south. But if so, he paid dear for making piety give place to policy, as the history of Absalom, whom he had by her, shows.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-6 The length of this war tried the faith and patience of David, and made his settlement at last the more welcome. The contest between grace and corruption in the hearts of believers, may fitly be compared to this warfare. There is a long war between them, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; but as the work of holiness is carried on, corruption, like the house of Saul, grows weaker and weaker; while grace, like the house of David, grows stronger and stronger.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab, having stopped the pursuit, passed the night with his army on the field of battle; the next morning he numbered the missing, and buried the dead; they carried the body of Asahel to Bethlehem and buried him there, and then joined David at Hebron.

For though contrary to the Law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>), it was yet looked upon as part of the state of a king, and as such had been practised by Gideon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/8-30.htm">Judges 8:30</a>), who approached more nearly to the royal dignity than any other of the judges. But it is the rule of the Books of Samuel that they generally abstain alike from praise and 'blame, and allow facts to speak for themselves. But never did a history more clearly deserve the title of  'A Vindication of the Justice of God.' Alike in Eli, in Saul, and in David, their sufferings were the result of their sins, and to the polygamy and lust of the last are due both the crimes which stained his character and the distress of the last twenty years of his life. (For <span class="cmt_word">Amnon</span>, his first born, see ch. 13.) <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joab replied, "If thou hadst not spoken (i.e., challenged to single combat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a>), the people would have gone away in the morning, every one from his brother," i.e., there would have been no such fratricidal conflict at all. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the substance of the oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>; the second gives greater force to it (vid., Ewald, 330, b.). Thus Joab threw all the blame of the fight upon Abner, because he had been the instigator of the single combat; and as that was not decisive, and was so bloody in its character, the two armies had felt obliged to fight it out. But he then commanded the trumpet to be blown for a halt, and the pursuit to be closed. </body></html>
