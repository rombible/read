The following verse brings out clearly the utter weakness of Ish-bosheth.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-10.htm" title="To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul, and to set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan even to Beersheba.">2 Samuel 3:10</a></span>. <span class="ital">To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul — </span>A wonderful change, which the study of revenge had wrought in him, that he who so lately had gone about the country confirming the Israelites in their opposition to David, now resolved to bring them all over to him! But here we see the hand of God. Providence made use of this unjust resentment of Abner to bring about its own designs with regard to David.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-21 Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are too proud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While men go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The words against Judah are very obscure. If the text be correct, the words would seem to be Ish-bosheth's, who in his anger had charged Abner with being a vile partisan of Judah: Abner retorts, "Am I((as you say) a dog's head which belongeth to Judah, or on Judah's side! This day I show you kindness, etc., and this day thou chargest me with a fault, etc." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 3:6-12. Abner Revolts to David.<p>6-11. Abner made himself strong for the house of Saul&#8212;In the East, the wives and concubines of a king are the property of his successor to this extent, that for a private person to aspire to marry one of them would be considered a virtual advance of pretensions to the crown (see 1Ki 2:17). It is not clear whether the accusation against Abner was well or ill founded. But he resented the charge as an indignity, and, impelled by revenge, determined to transfer all the weight of his influence to the opposite party. He evidently set a full value on his services, and seems to have lorded it over his weak nephew in a haughty, overbearing manner.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>To translate the kingdom from the house of Saul,....

The account of the sons who were born to David at Hebron does not break the thread, as Clericus, Thenius, and others suppose, but is very appropriately introduced here, as a practical proof of the strengthening of the house of David, in harmony with the custom of beginning the history of the reign of every king with certain notices concerning his family (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm">2 Samuel 5:13</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-1.htm">1 Kings 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-21.htm">1 Kings 14:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-2.htm">1 Kings 15:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-9.htm">1 Kings 15:9</a>, etc.). We have a similar list of the sons of David in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1-4</a>. The first two sons were born to him from the two wives whom he had brought with him to Hebron (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-42.htm">1 Samuel 25:42-43</a>). The Chethibh &#1493;&#1497;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493; is probably only a copyist's error for &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, which is the reading in many Codices. From Ahinoam - the first-born, Amnon (called Aminon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-20.htm">2 Samuel 13:20</a>); from Abigail - the second, Chileab. The latter is also called Daniel in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-1.htm">1 Chronicles 3:1</a>, and therefore had probably two names. The lamed before Ahinoam and the following names serves as a periphrasis for the genitive, like the German von, in consequence of the word son being omitted (vid., Ewald, 292, a.). The other four were by wives whom he had married in Hebron: Absalom by Maachah, the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur, a small kingdom in the north-east of Bashan (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-14.htm">Deuteronomy 3:14</a>); Adonijah by Haggith; Shephatiah by Abital; and Ithream by Eglah. The origin of the last three wives is unknown. The clause appended to Eglah's name, viz., "David's wife," merely serves as a fitting conclusion to the whole list (Bertheau on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-3.htm">1 Chronicles 3:3</a>), and is not added to show that Eglah was David's principal wife, which would necessitate the conclusion drawn by the Rabbins, that Michal was the wife intended. </body></html>
