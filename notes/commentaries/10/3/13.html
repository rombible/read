Besides the justice of this demand (Michal having been wrongfully taken from him by Saul), and besides all question of affection towards one who had loved him and saved his life (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-20.htm" title="And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul, and the thing pleased him.">1Samuel 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/19-11.htm" title="Saul also sent messengers to David's house, to watch him, and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told him, saying, If you save not your life to night, to morrow you shall be slain.">1Samuel 19:11-17</a>), there were political reasons of importance for the demand. The demand itself showed to all Israel that he bore no malice against the house of Saul, and the restoration would again constitute him Saul’s son-in-law, and thus further his claims to the throne; while it also showed publicly that he was in a condition to enforce his rights as against the house of Saul.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-13.htm" title="And he said, Well; I will make a league with you: but one thing I require of you, that is, You shall not see my face, except you first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face.">2 Samuel 3:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee — </span>David agreed to enter into a treaty with him, but upon condition that he procured the restitution of Michal his wife. Hereby David both showed the sincerity of his conjugal affection to his first and most rightful wife, from whom neither her nor his marrying another had alienated it, and also testified his respect to the house of Saul. “David did right in making this stipulation; for, whatever may be said of his other wives, he had certainly a claim to this, as she was his first wife, and a king’s daughter. And there was something of true generosity in this, both to her and to Saul, in that he received her after she had been another man’s, remembering how once she loved him, and knowing, probably, that she was, without her consent, separated from him; and to show that he did not carry his resentment of Saul’s cruel and unjust persecutions of him to any of his family; whereas many princes, for much less provocation of a wife’s father, would have turned off their consorts, in revenge of them, and even put them to death for having been married to another.” — Chandler.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:7-21 Many, like Abner, are not above committing base crimes, who are too proud to bear reproof, or even the suspicion of being guilty. While men go on in sin, and apparently without concern, they are often conscious that they are fighting against God. Many mean to serve their own purposes; and will betray those who trust them, when they can get any advantage. Yet the Lord serves his own designs, even by those who are thus actuated by revenge, ambition, or lust; but as they intend not to honour him, in the end they will be thrown aside with contempt. There was real generosity both to Michal and to the memory of Saul, in David's receiving the former, remembering probably how once he owed his life to her affection, and knowing that she was separated from him partly by her father's authority. Let no man set his heart on that which he is not entitled to. If any disagreement has separated husband and wife, as they expect the blessing of God, let them be reconciled, and live together in love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David's motive in requiring the restitution of Michal was partly his affection for her, and his memory of her love for him; partly the wish to wipe out the affront put upon him in taking away his wife, by obtaining her return; and partly, also, a politic consideration of the effect on Saul's partisans of a daughter of Saul being David's queen. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12, 13. Abner sent messengers to David&#8212;Though his language implied a secret conviction, that in supporting Ish-bosheth he had been laboring to frustrate the divine purpose of conferring the sovereignty of the kingdom on David, this acknowledgment was no justification either of the measure he was now adopting, or of the motives that prompted it. Nor does it seem possible to uphold the full integrity and honor of David's conduct in entertaining his secret overtures for undermining Ish-bosheth, except we take into account the divine promise of the kingdom, and his belief that the secession of Abner was a means designed by Providence for accomplishing it. The demand for the restoration of his wife Michal was perfectly fair; but David's insisting on it at that particular moment, as an indispensable condition of his entering into any treaty with Abner, seems to have proceeded not so much from a lingering attachment as from an expectation that his possession of her would incline some adherents of the house of Saul to be favorable to his cause.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will make a league with thee, </span> to wit, upon thy terms; which, all circumstances considered, seems to be lawful, to prevent the great effusion of Israelitish blood, which otherwise would certainly have been split. And although the principle of this action of Abner’s was base and wicked, yet the action itself was lawful and commendable, and no more than his duty to God and David obliged him to; and therefore David might well persuade and induce him to it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, well, I will make a league with thee,.... He accepted of the offer, he was ready and willing to enter into a covenant of friendship with him, and forgive all past offences: <p>but one thing I require of thee; as the condition of this covenant: <p>that is, thou shall not see my face; be admitted into my presence, or have any mark of my favour and respect: <p>except thou first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face; he insisted on it that Michal, Saul's daughter, and his wife, should be brought along with him, and presented to him; this was the preliminary to the league and covenant; if this was not complied with, the proposal would not be attended to. This shows the great affection David retained for his first wife, though he had had six since, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>, and though she had lived with another man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>; as also his great regard to the honour of Saul's family, that one of them might share with him in the grandeur of the kingdom; though this also might be a piece of policy in him, to gain the friends of Saul's family to him. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he said, Well; I will make a league with thee: but one thing I require of thee, that is, Thou shalt not see my face, except thou first bring Michal Saul's daughter, when thou comest to see my face.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">except thou first bring</span>] As the text stands it can only be rendered <span class="ital">except on condition of thy bringing</span>.

Saul's despotic act in giving her in marriage to another man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-44.htm">1 Samuel 25:44</a>) had been a public disavowal of David as the son-in-law of the royal house, and equivalent to a proclamation of outlawry. David's rights were all declared null by such an act. But now Ishbosheth must with equal publicity reverse his father's deed, and restore to David his lost position. It must have been a most painful humiliation to him to be driven thus to cancel his father's decree, and declare thereby to all Israel that he was unable to refuse hie assent to whatever his rival demanded.  And for this reason David sent his messengers directly to Ishbosheth, because the importance of Michal's surrender to him lay in its being a public act of the state. For <span class="accented">Michal</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>, we ought to read <span class="accented">Merab</span> (see note there). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Decline of the House of Saul. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-11</a>. Abner's quarrel with Ishbosheth. -  During the war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner adhered firmly to the house of Saul, but he appropriated one of Saul's concubines to himself. When Ishbosheth charged him with this, he fell into so violent a rage, that he at once announced to Ishbosheth his intention to hand over the kingdom to David. Abner had certainly perceived the utter incapacity of Ishbosheth for a very long time, if not from the very outset, and had probably made him king after the death of Saul, merely that he might save himself from the necessity of submitting to David, and might be able to rule in Ishbosheth's name, and possibly succeed in paving his own way to the throne. His appropriation of the concubine of the deceased monarch was at any rate a proof, according to Israelitish notions, and in fact those generally prevalent in the East, that he was aiming at the throne (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-21.htm">1 Kings 2:21</a>). But it may gradually have become obvious to him, that the house of Saul could not possibly retain the government in opposition to David; and this may have led to his determination to persuade all the Israelites to acknowledge David, and thereby to secure for himself an influential post under his government. This will explain in a very simple manner Abner's falling away from Ishbosheth and going over to David.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6-7</a><p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-6.htm">2 Samuel 3:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a> constitute one period, expanded by the introduction of circumstantial clauses, the &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497; (it came to pass) of the protasis being continued in the &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512; (he said) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>. "It came to pass, when there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, and Abner showed himself strong for the house of Saul, and Saul had a concubine named Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, that he (Ishbosheth) said to Abner, Why hast thou gone to my father's concubine?" The subject to "said" is omitted in the apodosis; but it is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-8.htm">2 Samuel 3:8</a>, and the expression "my father," that Ishbosheth is to be supplied. Even in the second circumstantial clause, "and Saul had a concubine," the reason why this is mentioned is only to be gathered from Ishbosheth's words. &#1489;&#1468; &#1492;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;: to prove one's self strong for, or with, a person, i.e., to render him powerful help. &#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; means "to cohabit with." It was the exclusive right of the successor to the throne to cohabit with the concubines of the deceased king, who came down to him as part of the property which he inherited.</body></html>
