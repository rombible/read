The contest between grace and corruption in the hearts of believers, may fitly be compared to this warfare. There is a long war between them, the flesh lusting against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh; but as the work of holiness is carried on, corruption, like the house of Saul, grows weaker and weaker; while grace, like the house of David, grows stronger and stronger.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Joab, having stopped the pursuit, passed the night with his army on the field of battle; the next morning he numbered the missing, and buried the dead; they carried the body of Asahel to Bethlehem and buried him there, and then joined David at Hebron.

The recent battle, though so much in favour of David, did not, put an end to the war between him and Ishbosheth, which lasted five years longer; for it was when Ishbosheth had reigned two years that that battle was fought, and he reigned five years longer; for not till his death, and when David had reigned above seven years in Hebron, was he made king over all Israel; and during this time peace was not made, but the war carried on; though perhaps not in pitched battles, of which we no more read, but in skirmishes: <p>but David waxed stronger and stronger; he having the advantage in all such skirmishes, and persons continually coming over to his side from the several tribes: <p>and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker: being always worsted whenever they skirmished with David's men, and by continual revolts from them. This is reckoned an emblem of the kingdoms of Christ and antichrist, the one increasing more and more, as it has and will do, and the other decreasing, and before long will be consumed; and of the two parties in a regenerate man, grace and indwelling sin, the one as to its exercise growing stronger and stronger, and the other as to its influence on the outward conversation weaker and weaker. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now there was <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker.</span><p>(a) That is, without intermission enduring two years, which was the whole reign of Ishbosheth.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-1.htm" title="Now there was long war between the house of Saul and the house of David: but David waxed stronger and stronger, and the house of Saul waxed weaker and weaker....">2 Samuel 3:1-5</a>.

It appears to interrupt the course of the narrative here, but it is quite in accordance with the usual practice of O.T. historians to insert information about the family of a king at critical points in the history of his reign, and moreover it is in place here as a practical evidence of the strengthening of David’s house. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/14-49.htm" title="Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua: and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:...">1 Samuel 14:49-51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/5-13.htm" title="And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David....">2 Samuel 5:13-16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Amnon</span>] Infamous for the sin which cost him his life, and indirectly proved the source of shame and calamity to his family and nation.

But after the death of this able man matters would go from bad to worse, and, though David probably remained on the defensive, yet the contrast between the peace and good government of Judah and the misery in Israel made all the tribes wish to put an end to a harassing civil war. It is plain, too, that the Philistines, repelled at first by Abner's skill, had again gained the ascendant, and regarded themselves so completely as the rulers of the country, that they resented immediately with summary violence the bold act of the northern tribes in choosing David to be their common king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Joab replied, "If thou hadst not spoken (i.e., challenged to single combat, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-14.htm">2 Samuel 2:14</a>), the people would have gone away in the morning, every one from his brother," i.e., there would have been no such fratricidal conflict at all. The first &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces the substance of the oath, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-34.htm">1 Samuel 25:34</a>; the second gives greater force to it (vid., Ewald, 330, b.). Thus Joab threw all the blame of the fight upon Abner, because he had been the instigator of the single combat; and as that was not decisive, and was so bloody in its character, the two armies had felt obliged to fight it out. But he then commanded the trumpet to be blown for a halt, and the pursuit to be closed. </body></html>
