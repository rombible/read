This example throws light upon God's government of the world, and furnishes a useful lesson. The pride of David's heart, was his sin in numbering of the people. He thought thereby to appear the more formidable, trusting in an arm of flesh more than he should have done, and though he had written so much of trusting in God only. God judges not of sin as we do. What appears to us harmless, or, at least, but a small offence, may be a great sin in the eye of God, who discerns the thoughts and intents of the heart. Even ungodly men can discern evil tempers and wrong conduct in believers, of which they themselves often remain unconscious. But God seldom allows those whom he loves the pleasures they sinfully covet.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div><a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-2.htm">1 Chronicles 21:2</a>, supplies some missing words. This passage should run, as at <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-4.htm">2 Samuel 24:4</a>, "And the king said to Joab and to the princes of the host who were with him," etc. (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-22.htm">1 Chronicles 27:22</a>). They were employed "with Joab" as his assistants in the numbering, exactly as in the previous numbering <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-4.htm">Numbers 1:4</a> when a prince was appointed from each tribe to be "with" Moses and Aaron. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 24<p>2Sa 24:1-9.

God, though He cannot tempt any man (Jas 1:13), is frequently described in Scripture as doing what He merely permits to be done; and so, in this case, He permitted Satan to tempt David. Satan was the active mover, while God only withdrew His supporting grace, and the great tempter prevailed against the king. (See Ex 7:13; 1Sa 26:19; 2Sa 16:10; Ps 105:25; Isa 7:17, &c.). The order was given to Joab, who, though not generally restrained by religious scruples, did not fail to present, in strong terms (see on [279]1Ch 21:3), the sin and danger of this measure. He used every argument to dissuade the king from his purpose. The sacred history has not mentioned the objections which he and other distinguished officers urged against it in the council of David. But it expressly states that they were all overruled by the inflexible resolution of the king.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Joab perceiving the king bent upon it, would not hazard the kingâ€™s favour by further disputing or disobeying his command. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Notwithstanding the king's word prevailed against Joab, and against the captains of the host,....
