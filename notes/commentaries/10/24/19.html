David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying all around, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not to expect and prepare for the close of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare the passage in Chronicles.

"Shall seven years of famine come upon thy land, or three months of flight before thine oppressors that they may pursue thee, or shall there be three days of pestilence in thy land? Now mark and see what answer I shall bring to Him that sendeth me." These three verses form one period, in which &#1490;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-13.htm">2 Samuel 24:13</a>) answers as the consequent to &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1511;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>, and the words from &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm">2 Samuel 24:11</a>) to &#1493;&#1488;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;&#1470;&#1500;&#1468;&#1498;) (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-12.htm">2 Samuel 24:12</a>) form a circumstantial clause inserted between. &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1497;: "and the word of the Lord had taken place (gone forth) to Gad, David's seer, saying, Go ... thus saith Jehovah, I lay upon thee three (things or evils); choose thee one of them that I may do it to thee." Instead of &#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1496;&#1500;, to lay upon, we find &#1504;&#1496;&#1492; in the Chronicles, "to turn upon thee." The three things are mentioned first of all in connection with the execution of Gad's commission to the king. Instead of seven years of famine, we find three years in the Chronicles; the Septuagint has also the number three in the passage before us, and apparently it is more in harmony with the connection, viz., three evils to choose from, and each lasting through three divisions of time. But this agreement favours the seven rather than the three, which is open to the suspicion of being intentionally made to conform to the rest. &#1504;&#1505;&#1498; is an infinitive: "thy fleeing," for that thou fliest before thine enemies. In the Chronicles the last two evils are described more fully, but the thought is not altered in consequence.</body></html>
