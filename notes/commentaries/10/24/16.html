Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-23.htm" title="For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two side posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you.">Exodus 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-49.htm" title="He cast on them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.">Psalm 78:49</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-35.htm" title="And it came to pass that night, that the angel of the LORD went out, and smote in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred fourscore and five thousand: and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses.">2 Kings 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/12-23.htm" title="And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.">Acts 12:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-41.htm" title="The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them which do iniquity;">Matthew 13:41</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the</span> Lord <span class="ital">repented him of the evil</span>] Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-14.htm" title="And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do to his people.">Exodus 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-13.htm" title="Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent him of the evil that he has pronounced against you.">Jeremiah 26:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/26-19.htm" title="Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to death? did he not fear the LORD, and sought the LORD, and the LORD repented him of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls.">Jeremiah 26:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/3-10.htm" title="And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way; and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would do to them; and he did it not.">Jonah 3:10</a>. On the one hand Scripture teaches us that “God is not a man that he should repent” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-19.htm" title="God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that he should repent: has he said, and shall he not do it? or has he spoken, and shall he not make it good?">Numbers 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a>); on the other hand it does not shrink from saying that God repents (<span class="ital">a</span>) when, as here, upon man’s penitence He withdraws or mitigates a punishment: (<span class="ital">b</span>) when, upon man’s faithlessness or disobedience, He cancels a promise or revokes a blessing which He had given. God’s repentance does not mean that He who foreknows all things <span class="ital">regrets</span> His action, nor is it a sign of mutability. Scripture boldly states the two apparently contradictory truths, and leaves conscience to harmonize them. See notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-11.htm" title="It repents me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried to the LORD all night.">1 Samuel 15:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-29.htm" title="And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.">1 Samuel 15:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the threshingplace of Araunah the Jebusite</span>] <span class="bld">The threshingfloor</span>: precisely the same word as in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm" title="And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-21.htm" title="And Araunah said, Why is my lord the king come to his servant? And David said, To buy the threshing floor of you, to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be stayed from the people.">2 Samuel 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-24.htm" title="And the king said to Araunah, No; but I will surely buy it of you at a price: neither will I offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God of that which does cost me nothing. So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.">2 Samuel 24:24</a></span>. Threshingfloors were constructed on eminences, to catch the wind for winnowing the grain. Araunah’s threshingfloor was on Mount Moriah, the hill to the eastward of Jerusalem, and was the site upon which the Temple was afterwards built (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm" title="Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared to David his father, in the place that David had prepared in the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). See Additional Note VI. p. 240. This Mount Moriah was identified by Jewish tradition (e.g. Josephus <span class="ital">Ant.</span> VII. 13. 4) with the mountain in the land of Moriah which was the scene of the sacrifice of Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm" title="And he said, Take now your son, your only son Isaac, whom you love, and get you into the land of Moriah; and offer him there for a burnt offering on one of the mountains which I will tell you of.">Genesis 22:2</a> ff.), but the identification has been questioned. See <span class="ital">Sinai and Pal.</span> p. 251.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It has been supposed by some that the sacred rock of the Moslems, which is the highest point of the Temple hill, and is now covered by the <span class="ital">Kubbet es Sakhrah</span> or “Dome of the Rock,” marks the actual site of Araunah’s threshing-floor. See <span class="ital">Sinai and Pal.</span> p. 178 ff.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Araunah</span>] The name is variously spelt Aravnah (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:16</a></span> <span class="ital">Qrî</span>), Avarnah (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-16.htm" title="And when the angel stretched out his hand on Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented him of the evil, and said to the angel that destroyed the people, It is enough: stay now your hand. And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing place of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:16</a></span> <span class="ital">Kthîbh</span>), Aranyah (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-18.htm" title="And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, Go up, raise an altar to the LORD in the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.">2 Samuel 24:18</a></span> <span class="ital">Kthîbh</span>); in Chron. it is written Ornan; and in the Sept. in both books “<span class="greekheb">Ὄρνα</span> (<span class="ital">Orna</span>). This variety of form is probably due to different attempts to represent a non-Hebraic name. There is no ground for the popular belief (based on a misunderstanding of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-23.htm" title="All these things did Araunah, as a king, give to the king. And Araunah said to the king, The LORD your God accept you.">2 Samuel 24:23</a></span>) that Araunah was the old king of Jebus before its conquest by David, and had been permitted by David to reside on his estate just outside Jerusalem. But his presence there is an evidence that the old inhabitants had been allowed to remain, and even to retain their property. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm" title="And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, which were not of the children of Israel,">1 Kings 9:20</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/24.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 16.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The angel.</span> In the next verse we are told that David saw the angel, and more fully in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21-16.htm">1 Chronicles 21:16</a> that he beheld him "standing between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand." The pestilence plainly was not a natural visitation; though possibly the means used was a simoom, or poisonous wind, advancing with terrible rapidity throughout Israel. <span class="cmt_word">The Lord repented.</span> In all the dealings of God's providence, his actions are made to depend upon human conduct. Looked at from above, from God's side, all things are foreknown and immutably fixed; looked at from man's side, all is perpetually changing as man changes. The rescue of Jerusalem as the result of David's penitence and prayers, is thus to human view a change in the counsels and even in the feelings of him who changeth not. <span class="cmt_word">The threshing place.</span> "The threshing floor," as rightly translated in vers. 18, 21, 24. Threshing floors were constructed, whenever possible, on eminences, that the wind might drive the chaff and dust away. Araunah's was on the east of Jerusalem, outside the walls, upon Mount Moriah, and was the site on which the temple was built (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-1.htm">2 Chronicles 3:1</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Araunah</span>. The name is so spelt seven times in vers. 20-24, for which reason the Massorites have substituted it for <span class="accented">Avarnah</span>, found in this verse in the Hebrew text, and for <span class="accented">Aranyah</span> in ver. 18. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/21.htm">1 Chronicles 21</a> the name is spelt <span class="accented">Ornan</span>; in the Septuagint in all places, <span class="greek">&#x1f48;&#x3c1;&#x3bd;&#x1f71;</span>, <span class="accented">Orna</span>, and in the Syriac, <span class="accented">Oron.</span> The name is, of course, a Jebusite word, and the variation arises from the narrators having written down the sound as it caught their ears. In this, as in many other particulars, it is clear that the chronicler derived his account from independent Sources. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/24.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's heart, i.e., his conscience, smote him, after he had numbered the people, or had given orders for the census to be taken. Having now come to a knowledge of his sin, he prayed to the Lord for forgiveness, because he had acted foolishly. The sin consisted chiefly in the self-exaltation which had led to this step (see the introductory remarks).</body></html>
