It also mentions that when David “offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD,” “He answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt offering.” David then fixed upon this as “the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-1.htm" title="Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.">1Chronicles 22:1</a>).<p>Thus, with David’s repentance and reconciliation to God after his second great sin closes this narrative and this book. David’s reign and life were now substantially ended—a witness to all time of the power of Divine Grace over human infirmity and sin, of God’s faithfulness and mercy to those that trust in Him, and of the triumph of an earnest and humble faith notwithstanding some very great and grievous falls.<p><span class= "bld">#define description=DESC<p>#define abbreviation=ABBR<p>#define comments=CMTS<p>#define version=3<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/24.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm" title="And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.">2 Samuel 24:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">David offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings — </span>Burnt- offerings were, in effect, prayers to God, that he would remove this plague and peace-offerings were acknowledgments of God’s goodness, who had already given David hopes of this mercy. Delaney supposes that the ninety- first Psalm was written by David in commemoration of his deliverance from this calamity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the history of David is the principal subject of the two books of Samuel, and as <span class="ital">his </span>is a very distinguished character, we shall here, in the conclusion of our notes on these books, present our readers with a short sketch of it, drawn by a masterly hand, but, as we think, in rather too glowing colours. “David’s is a character which stands single, in the accounts of the world equally eminent and unrivalled. For, not to insist on his great personal accomplishments, such as beauty, stature, strength, swiftness, and eloquence, his character is sufficiently distinguished by the noblest qualities, endowments, and events. Exalted from an humble shepherd to a mighty monarch, without any tincture of pride, disdain, or envy. Quite otherwise: remarkably humble in exaltation; or, rather, humbled by it. Exalted, unenvied. Exalted himself, and equally exalting the state he ruled: raising it from contempt, poverty, and oppression, to wealth, dignity, and sway. A man experienced in every vicissitude of fortune and life, and equal to them all. Thoroughly tried in adversity, and tempted by success, yet still superior. Cruelly and unjustly persecuted, yet not provoked to revenge. In the saddest and most sudden reverse of fortune, depressed by nothing but the remembrance of guilt; and, in consequence of that, unhumbled to any thing but God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“To sum up all; a true believer, and zealous adorer of God; teacher of his law and worship, and inspirer of his praise; a glorious example, a perpetual and inexhaustible fountain of true piety; a consummate and unequalled hero, a skilful and a fortunate captain; a steady patriot, a wise ruler, a faithful, a generous, and a magnanimous friend; and, what is yet rarer, a no less generous and magnanimous enemy; a true penitent, a divine musician, a sublime poet, and an inspired prophet. By birth, a peasant; by merit, a prince. In youth, a hero; in manhood, a monarch; in age, a saint.” — Delaney. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/24.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>24:18-25 God's encouraging us to offer to him spiritual sacrifices, is an evidence of his reconciling us to himself. David purchased the ground to build the altar. God hates robbery for burnt-offering. Those know not what religion is, who chiefly care to make it cheap and easy to themselves, and who are best pleased with that which costs them least pains or money. For what have we our substance, but to honour God with it; and how can it be better bestowed? See the building of the altar, and the offering proper sacrifices upon it. Burnt-offerings to the glory of God's justice; peace-offerings to the glory of his mercy. Christ is our Altar, our Sacrifice; in him alone we may expect to escape his wrath, and to find favour with God. Death is destroying all around, in so many forms, and so suddenly, that it is madness not to expect and prepare for the close of life.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Fifty shekels of silver - In Chronicles, "six hundred shekels of gold by weight." In explanation, it is supposed - that the fifty shekels here mentioned were gold shekels, each worth twelve silver shekels, so that the fifty gold shekels are equal to the 600 silver; that our text should be rendered, "David bought the threshing-floor and the oxen for money," namely, "fifty shekels;" and that the passage in Chronicles should be rendered, "David qave to Ornan gold shekels of the value" (or weight) "of 600 shekels." What is certain is that our text represents the fifty shekels as the price of the threshing-floor and the oxen.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/24.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25.
