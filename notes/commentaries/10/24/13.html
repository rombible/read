If we confess our sins, we may pray in faith that God would forgive them, and take away, by pardoning mercy, that sin which we cast away by sincere repentance. What we make the matter of our pride, it is just in God to take from us, or make bitter to us, and make it our punishment. This must be such a punishment as the people have a large share in, for though it was David's sin that opened the sluice, the sins of the people all contributed to the flood. In this difficulty, David chose a judgment which came immediately from God, whose mercies he knew to be very great, rather than from men, who would have triumphed in the miseries of Israel, and have been thereby hardened in their idolatry. He chose the pestilence; he and his family would be as much exposed to it as the poorest Israelite; and he would continue for a shorter time under the Divine rebuke, however severe it was. The rapid destruction by the pestilence shows how easily God can bring down the proudest sinners, and how much we owe daily to the Divine patience.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/24.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-13.htm">Ezekiel 14:13-21</a>.

But in Chronicles, it is "three years," which agrees better with the "three" months and "three" days.

Some conceive that here was an error in the transcriber, and that the true reading is three years, as the LXX. read it in this place, being supposed to have found it so in their copies, and that otherwise they durst never have presumed to make so great a change in the text. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. In Chron. he speaks exactly of those years of famine only which came for David’s sin; but here he speaks more confusedly and comprehensively, including those three years of famine sent for Saul’s sin, <span class="bld"> 2Sa 21</span>. And this sin of David’s was committed in the year next after them, which was in a manner a year of famine; either because it was the sabbatical year, wherein they might not sow nor reap; or rather, because not being able to sow in the third year, because of the excessive drought, they were not capable of reaping this fourth year. And three years more being added to these four, make up the seven here mentioned. So the meaning of the words is this, As thou hast already had four years of famine, shall three years more come? And that it is said of these seven years, that they shall come, it is a synecdochical expression frequent in Scripture, because part of the years were yet to come; even as it is said of the Israelites, that they should wander in the wilderness forty years, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-33.htm" title="And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your prostitutions, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.">Numbers 14:33</a></span>, when part of that time was already spent. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/24.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Gad came to David, and told him,....

This is probably right as being in harmony with the rest. Three years of famine, three months of defeat, or three days of pestilence. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a> famine, pestilence, and the sword are mentioned as three of God's four sore judgments. But a fourth judgment is there enumerated, namely, that of the increase of wild beasts, and Joshua the Stylite says that in Mesopotamia, as a result of the desolating war between the Romans and Persians, about A.D. , beasts of prey had become so numerous that they entered the villages and carried off the children from the streets, and were so bold and ferocious that even the men scarcely dared go about their labours in the fields (Jos. Styl., edit.
