He therefore concealed his resentment, and only expostulated with him on the injury done him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:28-33 By his insolent carriage toward Joab, Absalom brought Joab to plead for him. By his insolent message to the king, he gained his wishes. When parents and rulers countenance such characters, they will soon suffer the most fatal effects. But did the compassion of a father prevail to reconcile him to an impenitent son, and shall penitent sinners question the compassion of Him who is the Father of mercies?<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/14.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Three sons - These probably died in infancy (see the marginal reference).

So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face&#8212;Whatever error David committed in authorizing the recall of Absalom, he displayed great prudence and command over his feelings afterwards&#8212;for his son was not admitted into his father's presence but was confined to his own house and the society of his own family. This slight severity was designed to bring him to sincere repentance, on perceiving that his father had not fully pardoned him, as well as to convince the people of David's abhorrence of his crime. Not being allowed to appear at court, or to adopt any state, the courtiers kept aloof; even his cousin did not deem it prudent to go into his society. For two full years his liberty was more restricted, and his life more apart from his countrymen while living in Jerusalem, than in Geshur; and he might have continued in this disgrace longer, had he not, by a violent expedient, determined (2Sa 14:30) to force his case on the attention of Joab, through whose kind and powerful influence a full reconciliation was effected between him and his father.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then Joab arose, and came to Absalom unto his house,....

But, while we cannot acquit Absalom of petulance, we must not regard his act as one of angry revenge; had it been so, Joab would have openly resented it, and he was quite capable of making even the heir apparent feel his anger. It was probably intended as a rough practical joke, which taught Joab better manners, and which he must laugh at, though with inward displeasure. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>There was no man in all Israel so handsome as Absalom. &#1502;&#1488;&#1491; &#1500;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, "to much praising," i.e., so that he was greatly praised. from the sole of the foot even to the crown of his head, there was no fault (&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, bodily blemish) in him.</body></html>
