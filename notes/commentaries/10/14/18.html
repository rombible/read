Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God, &c.&#8212;Her argument may be made clear in the following paraphrase:&#8212;You have granted me the pardon of a son who had slain his brother, and yet you will not grant to your subjects the restoration of Absalom, whose criminality is not greater than my son's, since he killed his brother in similar circumstances of provocation. Absalom has reason to complain that he is treated by his own father more sternly and severely than the meanest subject in the realm; and the whole nation will have cause for saying that the king shows more attention to the petition of a humble woman than to the wishes and desires of a whole kingdom. The death of my son is a private loss to my family, while the preservation of Absalom is the common interest of all Israel, who now look to him as your successor on the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then the king answered and said unto the woman,....

And because the king speaketh this word, he is as one inculpating himself, since the king does not let his own rejected one return." &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "like one who has laden himself with guilt," is the predicate to the clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. These words of the woman were intentionally kept indefinite, rather hinting at what she wished to place before the king, than expressing it distinctly. This is more particularly applicable to the first clause, which needs the words that follow to render it intelligible, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is ambiguous; so that Dathe and Thenius are wrong in rendering it, "Why dost thou propose such things towards the people of God?" and understanding it as relating to the protection which the king was willing to extend to her and to her son. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; with &#1506;&#1500; does not mean to think or reflect "with regard to," but "against" a person. Ewald is quite correct in referring the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; to what follows: such things, i.e., such thoughts as thou hast towards thy son, whose blood-guiltiness thou wilt not forgive. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;, without the article, is intentionally indefinite, "against people of God," i.e., against members of the congregation of God. "This word" refers to the decision which the king had pronounced in favour of the widow. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, literally, in not letting him return.<p>In order to persuade the king to forgive, the crafty woman reminded him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>) of the brevity of human life and of the mercy of God: "For we must die, and (are) as water spilt upon the ground, which is not (cannot be) gathered up, and God does not take a soul away, but thinks thoughts, that He may not thrust from Him one expelled." Although these thoughts are intentionally expressed quite generally, their special allusion to the case in hand can easily be detected. We must all die, and when dead our life is irrevocably gone. Thou mightest soon experience this in the case of Absalom, if thou shouldst suffer him to continue in exile. God does not act thus; He does not deprive the sinner of life, but is merciful, and does not cast off for ever.</body></html>
