The truth is, when Joab had greatly gratified the king and gained credit with him, by bringing back Absalom to Jerusalem, he had little reason, as a minister, to be solicitous to bring him near the king’s person, and restore him to full favour; because, in that case, he might naturally apprehend that Absalom’s interest with his father might impair his own.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:28-33 By his insolent carriage toward Joab, Absalom brought Joab to plead for him.

So Absalom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, and saw not the king's face&#8212;Whatever error David committed in authorizing the recall of Absalom, he displayed great prudence and command over his feelings afterwards&#8212;for his son was not admitted into his father's presence but was confined to his own house and the society of his own family. This slight severity was designed to bring him to sincere repentance, on perceiving that his father had not fully pardoned him, as well as to convince the people of David's abhorrence of his crime. Not being allowed to appear at court, or to adopt any state, the courtiers kept aloof; even his cousin did not deem it prudent to go into his society. For two full years his liberty was more restricted, and his life more apart from his countrymen while living in Jerusalem, than in Geshur; and he might have continued in this disgrace longer, had he not, by a violent expedient, determined (2Sa 14:30) to force his case on the attention of Joab, through whose kind and powerful influence a full reconciliation was effected between him and his father.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">To have sent him to the king; </span> that by his mediation he might be admitted into the king’s favour and presence. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He would not come; </span> partly, because perceiving David’s affections to be cold to Absalom, he would not venture his own interest for him, especially in desiring that which he feared he should be denied; partly, lest by interceding further for Absalom, he should revive the remembrance of his former murder, and meet with the reproach of one murderer’s interceding for another; and partly, because by converse with Absalom he observed his temper to be such, that if once he were fully restored to the king’s favour, he would not only eclipse and oppose Joab’s interest and power with the king, but also attempt high things, not without danger to the king and kingdom, as it happened. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Therefore Absalom sent for Joab, to have sent him to the king,....
