Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God, &c.&#8212;Her argument may be made clear in the following paraphrase:&#8212;You have granted me the pardon of a son who had slain his brother, and yet you will not grant to your subjects the restoration of Absalom, whose criminality is not greater than my son's, since he killed his brother in similar circumstances of provocation. Absalom has reason to complain that he is treated by his own father more sternly and severely than the meanest subject in the realm; and the whole nation will have cause for saying that the king shows more attention to the petition of a humble woman than to the wishes and desires of a whole kingdom. The death of my son is a private loss to my family, while the preservation of Absalom is the common interest of all Israel, who now look to him as your successor on the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable; </span> I doubt not the king will give a gracious and satisfactory answer to my petition. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">As an angel of God, </span> to wit, in wisdom, and justice, and goodness. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To discern good and bad; </span> to hear and judge of causes and requests, whether they be just, and good, and fit to be granted, as mine is; or unrighteous, and unreasonable, and fit to be rejected. So she intimates her confidence in the justice of her cause, and thereby confirms the king in his purpose and promise to grant her request, and withal arms the king against the suggestions of them who should advise him to a rigorous execution of God’s law against Absalom, and be ready to censure him for restoring Absalom, and this for want of that angelical wisdom which the king had, who wisely considered many things far above their reach. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Therefore; </span> because thou art so wise, and just, and pitiful, and gracious to those who in strict justice deserve punishment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The Lord thy God will be with thee; </span> God will own and stand by thee in this thy act of grace; or, God will prosper thee in thy enterprises; or, at least, not be offended with thee. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then thine handmaid said, the word of my lord the king shall now be comfortable,....

She therefore said still further: "I pray thee, let the king remember Jehovah thy God, that the avenger of blood may no more prepare destruction, and that they may not destroy my son." The Chethib &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is probably a copyist's error for &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, for which the Masoretes would write &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, the construct state of &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, - a form of the inf. abs. which is not commonly used, and which may possibly have been chosen because &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; had become altogether an adverb (vid., Ewald, 240, e.). The context requires the inf. constr. &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;: that the avenger of blood may not multiply (make much) to destroy, i.e., may not add to the destruction; and &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is probably only a verbal noun used instead of the infinitive. The king immediately promised on oath that her son should not suffer the least harm.</body></html>
