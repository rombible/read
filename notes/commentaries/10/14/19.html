He knew Joab as “wily and politic and unscrupulous,” but we do not know why he suspected him of this especial interest in Absalom. Perhaps it was only the prosperous courtier’s interest in the heir-apparent, but probably Joab had made the same request before, so that the king recognised its source.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>14:1-20 We may notice here, how this widow pleads God's mercy, and his clemency toward poor guilty sinners. The state of sinners is a state of banishment from God.

Wherefore then hast thou thought such a thing against the people of God, &c.&#8212;Her argument may be made clear in the following paraphrase:&#8212;You have granted me the pardon of a son who had slain his brother, and yet you will not grant to your subjects the restoration of Absalom, whose criminality is not greater than my son's, since he killed his brother in similar circumstances of provocation. Absalom has reason to complain that he is treated by his own father more sternly and severely than the meanest subject in the realm; and the whole nation will have cause for saying that the king shows more attention to the petition of a humble woman than to the wishes and desires of a whole kingdom. The death of my son is a private loss to my family, while the preservation of Absalom is the common interest of all Israel, who now look to him as your successor on the throne.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/14.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?</span> hast thou not said and done this by Joab’s direction and contrivance? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">None can turn to the right hand or to the left from ought that my lord the king hath spoken:</span> as the king is so wise that no man can deceive him by any turnings or windings to the right or left hand, but he quickly searcheth out the truth in every thing; so, (it is a folly to dissemble, or go about to conceal it,) it is even so, thou hast now discovered the truth of this business. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He put all these words in the mouth of thine handmaid, </span> to wit, for the scope and substance of them, but not as to all the expressions which she used, for these were to be varied as the king’s answer gave occasion, which also she did with singular prudence. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/14.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said, is not the hand of Joab with thee in all this?....

The king really was uncertain, and asked dubiously, whereas the Authorized Version admits only of an. affirmative answer. David had seen the general drift of the woman's meaning, but she had involved it in too much obscurity for him to do more than suspect that she was the mouthpiece of Joab, who was standing by, and whose face may have given signs of a more than ordinary interest in the woman's narrative. She now frankly acknowledges the truth, but skilfully interweaves much flattery in her answer. And  her words are far more expressive than what is given in our versions. Literally they are, <span class="accented">By thy life, O my lord the king, there is nothing on the right or on the left of all that my lord the king has spoken.</span> His words had gone straight to the mark, without the slightest deviation on either side. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/14.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the woman had accomplished so much, she asked permission to speak one word more; and having obtained it, proceeded to the point she wanted to reach: "And wherefore thinkest thou such things against people of God? And because the king speaketh this word, he is as one inculpating himself, since the king does not let his own rejected one return." &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, "like one who has laden himself with guilt," is the predicate to the clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. These words of the woman were intentionally kept indefinite, rather hinting at what she wished to place before the king, than expressing it distinctly. This is more particularly applicable to the first clause, which needs the words that follow to render it intelligible, as &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is ambiguous; so that Dathe and Thenius are wrong in rendering it, "Why dost thou propose such things towards the people of God?" and understanding it as relating to the protection which the king was willing to extend to her and to her son. &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; with &#1506;&#1500; does not mean to think or reflect "with regard to," but "against" a person. Ewald is quite correct in referring the word &#1499;&#1468;&#1494;&#1488;&#1514; to what follows: such things, i.e., such thoughts as thou hast towards thy son, whose blood-guiltiness thou wilt not forgive. &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1501;, without the article, is intentionally indefinite, "against people of God," i.e., against members of the congregation of God. "This word" refers to the decision which the king had pronounced in favour of the widow. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, literally, in not letting him return.<p>In order to persuade the king to forgive, the crafty woman reminded him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-14.htm">2 Samuel 14:14</a>) of the brevity of human life and of the mercy of God: "For we must die, and (are) as water spilt upon the ground, which is not (cannot be) gathered up, and God does not take a soul away, but thinks thoughts, that He may not thrust from Him one expelled." Although these thoughts are intentionally expressed quite generally, their special allusion to the case in hand can easily be detected. We must all die, and when dead our life is irrevocably gone. Thou mightest soon experience this in the case of Absalom, if thou shouldst suffer him to continue in exile. God does not act thus; He does not deprive the sinner of life, but is merciful, and does not cast off for ever.</body></html>
