Amasa&#8212;By the genealogy it appears that this captain stood in the same relation to David as Joab, both being his nephews. Of course, Amasa was Absalom's cousin, and though himself an Israelite, his father was an Ishmaelite (1Ch 2:17).<p>Nahash&#8212;is thought by some to be another name of Jesse, or according to others, the name of Jesse's wife.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Ithra an Israelite.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Object.</span> He was an Ishmaelite, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm" title="And Abigail bore Amasa: and the father of Amasa was Jether the Ishmeelite.">1 Chronicles 2:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Answ</span>.

And Amasa is here called an Israelite, either because he was a proselyte; or in opposition to Joab, who was of the tribe of Judah, as Amasa was of one of the ten tribes; or rather, to intimate, that although he or his parents were called Ishmaelites for some reason, yet as to their extraction they were indeed Israelites; which if Amasa had not been, it is not probable that he could have had so powerful an influence upon the tribe of Judah as he had, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm" title="And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return you, and all your servants.">2 Samuel 19:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">That went in to Abigail, </span> i.e. lay with her, whether being first married to her, or not, is uncertain. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The daughter of Nahash.</span> Nahash is either another name of Jesse; or rather, the name of Jesse’s wife; by whom he had this Abigail, as he had Zeruiah by another wife; so they were sisters by the father, but not by the mother; and Nahash is here named to signify so much. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Absalom made Amasa captain of the host instead of Joab,....

And the sons of Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three....">1 Chronicles 2:16-17</a> that Abigail and Zeruiah were Jesse’s daughters. Who then was Nahash? To this three answers may be given. (1) The obvious one, that she was Jesse’s wife, to which the objection is that Nahash is not a woman’s name. (2) That Nahash is another name for Jesse, which is the Jewish tradition, but is not supported by any evidence. (3) That Nahash was the first husband of Jesse’s wife, so that Abigail and Zeruiah were only step-sisters to David. This view has in its favour the guarded statement of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-16.htm" title="Whose sisters were Zeruiah, and Abigail. And the sons of Zeruiah; Abishai, and Joab, and Asahel, three.">1 Chronicles 2:16</a>, which does not say that they were Jesse’s daughters, but <span class="ital">sisters of his sons</span>. To go on to identify Nahash with the king of the Ammonites defeated by Saul is mere conjecture. It should be noted that Amasa and Joab were cousins.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/17.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ithra an Israelite.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a> he is called "Jether the Ishmeelite." The first name is the same, Ithra being the emphatic form of Jether; and as it is difficult to find a reason for mentioning so ordinary a fact as that his father was an Israelite, we may conclude that "Ishmeelite" is the correct reading. Bishop Wordsworth, however, suggests that "Israelite" was in contrast to "Judahite;" but this distinction did not come into use until after the disruption of the kingdom. The Vatican text of the Septuagint has "Jezreelite," which is probably a conjecture to get rid of the obvious error of calling him an Israelite. Amasa was an illegitimate son, which confirms the reading "Ishmeelite" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-17.htm">1 Chronicles 2:17</a>, as a marriage between Abigail and a foreigner would be sure to be opposed by all the members of Jesse's family. <span class="cmt_word">Nahash</span>. Jewish interpreters regard Nahash (equivalent to "serpent") as another name for Jesse, quoting in proof, "Out of the root of Nahash (the serpent) shall come forth the basilisk" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>), which in the Chaldee Paraphrase is explained as meaning, "out of the root of Jesse shall come forth the Messiah." This conceit would scarcely have deserved mention, had it not found a place in the margin of the Authorized Version. Some few commentators regard Nahash as a woman's name, and think that she was a wife of Jesse, and mother of Abigail and Zerniah, but not of David. But Nahash is so constantly a man's name that it is easier to believe that Nahash was the first husband of David's mother, and Abigail and Zerniah his half-sisters, not on the father's, but on the mother's side. Joab and his brothers are always described as sons of Zeruiah, both to mark their relationship to David, and also because the rank was on her side. Amasa was probably the Amasai mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a> as bringing a powerful reinforcement to David while at Ziklag; but the ambition of supplanting Joab made him now forget David's long friendship. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>And the man's wife spread a covering (&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505;&#1498;, the covering which she had close at hand) over the well (over the opening into the cistern), and scattered groats (&#1512;&#1497;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514;, peeled barley: <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-22.htm">Proverbs 27:22</a>) upon it, so that nothing was noticed.
