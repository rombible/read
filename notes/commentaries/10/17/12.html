This is very beautiful and expressive. “The dew in Palestine, as in several other climates, falls fast and sudden; and is therefore an apt emblem of an active and expeditious soldiery. And it was, perhaps, for this reason that the Romans called their light armed forces, <span class="ital">rorarii. </span>The dew falls upon every spot of the earth; not a blade of grass escapes it. A numerous army resembles it in this respect; it is able to search everywhere.” — Delaney.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>17:1-21 Here was a wonderful effect of Divine Providence blinding Absalom's mind and influencing his heart, that he could not rest in Ahithophel's counsel, and that he should desire Hushai's advice. But there is no contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the dew - Like the drops of dew, in the vast number of our host, and in our irresistible and unavoidable descent upon our enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. we will light upon him as the dew falleth on the ground&#8212;No image could have symbolized the sudden onset of an enemy so graphically to an Oriental mind as the silent, irresistible, and rapid descent of this natural moisture on every field and blade of grass.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">As the dew falleth on the ground, </span> i. e. plenteously, suddenly, irresistibly, and on all sides; for so the dew falls. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So shall we come upon him in some place where he shall be found,....

Hushai said, "The advice is not good that Ahithophel hath given this time;" and then still further explained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>): "Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are heroes, and of a ferocious disposition (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>), like a bear in the field robbed of her young; and thy father is a man of war, and will not pass the night with the people," sc., so that it would be possible to come upon him unawares and slay him (&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>). The idea that &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; is to be taken as a Hiphil, in the sense of "and does not let the people lodge for the night" (Bttcher), is quite untenable, since it does not tally with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-9.htm">2 Samuel 17:9</a>, "Behold, he is hid now in one of the pits, or one of the places (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are hiding-places that are strong by nature, &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514; are places rendered strong by art); and it comes to pass that he falls upon them at the first: so will men hear it, and say a defeat has taken place among the people that follow Absalom." &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; with &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-7.htm">Joshua 11:7</a>, to fall upon a person. The subject to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is David, but it is not mentioned as being evident enough from the context; so that there is no necessity for the emendation &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;, which Thenius proposes. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; relates to those making the attack, the hosts of Absalom. Thenius has given the meaning correctly: "The report that David has made an attack will be sufficient to give rise to the belief that our men have sustained a severe defeat."  </body></html>
