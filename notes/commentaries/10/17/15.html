But there is no contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As the dew - Like the drops of dew, in the vast number of our host, and in our irresistible and unavoidable descent upon our enemies. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/17.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 17:15-22.

Hushai said, "The advice is not good that Ahithophel hath given this time;" and then still further explained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-8.htm">2 Samuel 17:8</a>): "Thou knowest thy father and his men, that they are heroes, and of a ferocious disposition (like <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-25.htm">Judges 18:25</a>), like a bear in the field robbed of her young; and thy father is a man of war, and will not pass the night with the people," sc., so that it would be possible to come upon him unawares and slay him (&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; with &#1488;&#1514;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/19-4.htm">Job 19:4</a>). The idea that &#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1503; is to be taken as a Hiphil, in the sense of "and does not let the people lodge for the night" (Bttcher), is quite untenable, since it does not tally with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-9.htm">2 Samuel 17:9</a>, "Behold, he is hid now in one of the pits, or one of the places (&#1508;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; are hiding-places that are strong by nature, &#1502;&#1511;&#1493;&#1502;&#1514; are places rendered strong by art); and it comes to pass that he falls upon them at the first: so will men hear it, and say a defeat has taken place among the people that follow Absalom." &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; with &#1489;&#1468;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-7.htm">Joshua 11:7</a>, to fall upon a person. The subject to &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; is David, but it is not mentioned as being evident enough from the context; so that there is no necessity for the emendation &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493;, which Thenius proposes. The suffix &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501; relates to those making the attack, the hosts of Absalom. Thenius has given the meaning correctly: "The report that David has made an attack will be sufficient to give rise to the belief that our men have sustained a severe defeat."  </body></html>
