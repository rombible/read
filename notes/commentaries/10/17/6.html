But there is no contending with that God who can arm a man against himself, and destroy him by his own mistakes and passions. Ahithophel's former counsel was followed, for God intended to correct David; but his latter counsel was not followed, for God meant not to destroy him. He can overrule all counsels. Whatever wisdom or help any man employs or affords, the success is from God alone, who will not let his people perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/17.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The man whom thou seekest - namely, David.

Ahithophel's Counsel Overthrown by Hushai.<p>1-11. Moreover Ahithophel said unto Absalom&#8212;The recommendation to take prompt and decisive measures before the royalist forces could be collected and arranged, evinced the deep political sagacity of this councillor. The adoption of his advice would have extinguished the cause of David; and it affords a dreadful proof of the extremities to which the heartless prince was, to secure his ambitious objects, prepared to go, that the parricidal counsel "pleased Absalom well, and all the elders of Israel." It was happily overruled, however, by the address of Hushai, who saw the imminent danger to which it would expose the king and the royal cause. He dwelt upon the warlike character and military experience of the old king&#8212;represented him and his adherents as mighty men, who would fight with desperation; and who, most probably, secure in some stronghold, would be beyond reach, while the smallest loss of Absalom's men at the outset might be fatal to the success of the conspiracy. But his dexterity was chiefly displayed in that part of his counsel which recommended a general levy throughout the country; and that Absalom should take command of it in person&#8212;thereby flattering at once the pride and ambition of the usurper. The bait was caught by the vainglorious and wicked prince.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/17.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/17.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when Hushai was come to Absalom,....

For (as the historian adds in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-23.htm">2 Samuel 16:23</a> by way of explanation) the counsel of Ahithophel, which he counselled in those days, was like a divine oracle both with David and with Absalom. The words from &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1514; to &#1492;&#1492;&#1501; are placed at the commencement absolutely: "and (as for) the counsel of Ahithophel, ... as if one inquired the word of God, so was every counsel of Ahithophel." The Masoretes have supplied &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; as the Keri to &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500;. This is correct so far as the sense is concerned, but it is quite unnecessary, as &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; may be taken impersonally. &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; is to be explained from the formula &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1500; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1</a>). </body></html>
