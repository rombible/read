(See Note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-2.htm" title="And to David were sons born in Hebron: and his firstborn was Amnon, of Ahinoam the Jezreelitess;">2Samuel 3:2-5</a>.) This verse may be considered parenthetical:—The king’s sons came . . . and wept sore. (“Only Absalom fled and went to . . . Geshur.”) In this case the omission of “David” in the latter clause of the verse is explained, as the nominative is easily supplied from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-36.htm" title="And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of speaking, that, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept: and the king also and all his servants wept very sore.">2Samuel 13:36</a>.<p><span class= "bld">For his son every day.</span>—Amnon is certainly the son here meant, for whom David continually mourned until his grief was gradually assuaged by the lapse of time.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-37.htm" title="But Absalom fled, and went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur.

Instead of loathing Absalom as a murderer, David, after a time, longed to go forth to him. This was David's infirmity: God saw something in his heart that made a difference, else we should have thought that he, as much as Eli, honoured his sons more than God.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference.<p>Ammihur (see the margin) is found as a Punic name. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 13:37-39.

The cities of refuge could afford him no sanctuary, and he was compelled to leave the kingdom, taking refuge at the court of Geshur, with his maternal grandfather, who would, doubtless, approve of his conduct.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Talmai, the son of Ammihud; </span> his mother’s father, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm" title="And his second, Chileab, of Abigail the wife of Nabal the Carmelite; and the third, Absalom the son of Maacah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;">2 Samuel 3:3</a></span>; that he might have present protection and sustenance from him; and that by his mediation he might obtain his father’s pardon and favour. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/13.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>But Absalom fled,....

Some think it was for Absalom he mourned, but rather for Amnon. The reason why he mourned for him, when he did not for his child by Bathsheba, who died, because that was an infant, this a grown man, and heir to his crown, and was slain by the sword of his brother, and so fulfilled a threatening to himself on account of his own sin, which, hereby no doubt, was brought fresh to his mind. <p>(q)  "cunctis diebus", V.
