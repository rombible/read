Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make me cakes ... a pan - The words here used occur nowhere else, and the etymology is doubtful.

The meaning of the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1502;&#1490;&#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; cannot be more precisely determined. The current rendering, "axes or hatchets," is simply founded upon the circumstance that &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;, to cut, is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-4.htm">2 Kings 6:4</a> to the felling of trees. The reading in the Chronicles, &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, is evidently a copyist's error, as we have already had &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1512;&#1492;, "with the saw." The meaning of the next clause is a disputed point, as the reading itself varies, and the Masoretes read &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1503; instead of the Chethibh &#1489;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, "he made them go through brick-kilns," i.e., burnt them in brick-kilns, as the lxx and Vulgate render it. On the other hand, Thenius takes the Chethibh under his protection, and adopts Kimchi's explanation: "he led them through Malchan, i.e., through the place where the Ammonites burned their children in honour of their idol." Thenius would therefore alter &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; into &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501; or &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;: "he offered them as sacrifices in their image of Moloch. " But this explanation cannot be even grammatically sustained, to say nothing of the arbitrary character of the alteration proposed; for the technical expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1495;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, "to cause to go through the fire for Moloch" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-21.htm">Leviticus 18:21</a>), is essentially different from &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1495;&#1506;&#1489;&#1497;&#1512;, to cause to pass through Moloch, an expression that we never meet with. Moreover, it is impossible to see how burning the Ammonites in the image of Moloch could possibly be "an obvious mode of punishing idolatry," since the idolatry itself consisted in the fact that the Ammonites burned their children to Moloch. So far as the circumstances themselves are concerned, the cruelties inflicted upon the prisoners are not to be softened down, as Daaz and others propose, by an arbitrary perversion of the words into a mere sentence to hard labour, such as sawing wood, burning bricks, etc. At the same time, the words of the text do not affirm that all the inhabitants of Rabbah were put to death in this cruel manner. &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1492;&#1506;&#1501; (without &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;) refers no doubt simply to the fighting men that were taken prisoners, or at the most to the male population of the acropolis of Rabbah, who probably consisted of fighting men only. In doing this, David merely retaliated upon the Ammonites the cruelties with which they had treated their foes; since according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a> they ripped up women who were with child, and according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-2.htm">1 Samuel 11:2</a> their king Nahash would only make peace with the inhabitants of Jabesh upon the condition that the right eye of every one of them should be put out. It is sufficiently evident from this, that the Ammonites had aimed at the most shameful extermination of the Israelites. "Thus did he unto all the cities of the Ammonites," i.e., to all the fortified cities that resisted the Israelites. After the close of this war, David returned to Jerusalem with all the men of war. The war with the Syrians and Ammonites, including as it did the Edomitish war as well, was the fiercest in which David was ever engaged, and was also the last great war of his life. </body></html>
