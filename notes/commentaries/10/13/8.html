Adultery and murder were David's sins, the like sins among his children were the beginnings of his punishment: he was too indulgent to his children. Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse. Let no one ever expect good treatment from those who are capable of attempting their seduction; but it is better to suffer the greatest wrong than to commit the least sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Make me cakes ... a pan - The words here used occur nowhere else, and the etymology is doubtful.

The following occurrences are assigned in a general manner to the times succeeding the Ammonitish war, by the words "And it came to pass after this;" and as David did not marry Maacah the mother of Absalom and Tamar till after he had been made king at Hebron (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-3.htm">2 Samuel 3:3</a>), they cannot well have taken place before the twentieth year of his reign. Amnon, the eldest son of David by Ahinoam the Jezreelite (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>), loved Tamar, the beautiful sister of his step-brother Absalom, so passionately that he became ill in consequence, because he could not get near to her as she was a virgin. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-2.htm">2 Samuel 13:2</a> form one period. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512; is a continuation of &#1488;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;; and the words from &#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1501; to &#1489;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; are a circumstantial clause. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1512;: literally "it became narrow (anxious) to Amnon, even to making himself ill," i.e., he quite pined away, not "he pretended to be ill" (Luther), for it was not till afterwards that he did this according to Jonadab's advice (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-5.htm">2 Samuel 13:5</a>). &#1492;&#1514;&#1492;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;: to make one's self ill, here to become ill, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-5.htm">2 Samuel 13:5</a> to pretend to be ill. The clause &#1492;&#1497;&#1488; &#1489;&#1514;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; is to be joined to the one which follows: "because she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to him to do anything to her." The maidenly modesty of Tamar evidently raised an insuperable barrier to the gratification of his lusts.</body></html>
