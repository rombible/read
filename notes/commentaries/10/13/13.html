Amnon, however, knew the Law too well to have any hope of a legitimate marriage with Tamar, and, therefore, persisted in his violence.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/13-13.htm" title="And I, where shall I cause my shame to go? and as for you, you shall be as one of the fools in Israel.

Thus David might trace the sins of his children to his own misconduct, which must have made the anguish of the chastisement worse.

The Levitical law forbade them (marginal reference), and Tamar may have merely wished to temporize. On the other hand, the debasing and unhumanizing institution of the harem, itself contrary to the law of Moses <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>, may well have led to other deviations from its precepts, and the precedent of Abraham <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/20-12.htm">Genesis 20:12</a> may have seemed to give some sanction to this particular breach of it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/13.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12-14. do not force me&#8212;The remonstrances and arguments of Tamar were so affecting and so strong, that had not Amnon been violently goaded on by the lustful passion of which he had become the slave, they must have prevailed with him to desist from his infamous purpose.
