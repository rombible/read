Benaiah, who commanded them, a hero from Kabzeel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-20.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man, of Kabzeel, who had done many acts, he slew two lion like men of Moab: he went down also and slew a lion in the middle of a pit in time of snow:">2Samuel 23:20</a>), was afterwards promoted by Solomon to be general-in-chief (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-35.htm" title="And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the host: and Zadok the priest did the king put in the room of Abiathar.">1Kings 2:35</a>). But the meaning of the words, “the Che-rethites and the Pelethites,” has been much disputed. On the one hand it is urged that the form of the name indicates a tribal designation, and that there was a tribe of Cherethites living south of Philistia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1Samuel 30:14</a>), who are also mentioned in connection with the Philistines in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. Besides, these names appear as those of bodies of troops only during the reign of David, and the objection that he would have been unlikely to employ foreign mercenaries may be met by the supposition that they had embraced the religion of Israel. On the other hand, the Chaldee (“archers and slingers<span class= "ital">”</span>) and Syriac (“nobles and Tustics”) understood them as appellatives, and it is said that they should properly be translated “executioners and runners,” such offices falling to the chief troops in all Oriental armies; no tribe of “Pelethites” is known, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2Samuel 20:23</a> the expression translated “Cherethites and Pelethites” has another form for “Cherethites,” which again occurs with “Pelethites” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm" title="And the seventh year Jehoiada sent and fetched the rulers over hundreds, with the captains and the guard, and brought them to him into the house of the LORD, and made a covenant with them, and took an oath of them in the house of the LORD, and showed them the king's son.">2Kings 11:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm" title="And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land; and they brought down the king from the house of the LORD, and came by the way of the gate of the guard to the king's house.

Such use of the word had become now almost obsolete, and quite so in the time when the Chronicles were written, since they substitute here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1Chronicles 18:17</a>) “chief about (literally, <span class= "ital">at the hand of</span>) the king.” For this change in the use of the word, “exact analogies may be found in ecclesiastical words, as bishop, priest, deacon, minister, and many others.”—<span class= "ital">Speaker’s Commentary.</span><p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and David's sons were chief rulers.">2 Samuel 8:18</a></span>. <span class="ital">Benaiah, </span>&c. — Benaiah was one of David’s three worthies of the second order; eminent for many great exploits, of which three only are recounted by the sacred historian. <span class="ital">Was over both the Cherethites and the Pelethites — </span>These were undoubtedly soldiers of some kind, and even such as were eminent for their valour and fidelity to the king, as is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2 Samuel 15:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-7.htm" title="And there went out after him Joab's men, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and all the mighty men: and they went out of Jerusalem, to pursue after Sheba the son of Bichri.">2 Samuel 20:7</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-38.htm" title="So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride on king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.">1 Kings 1:38</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-44.htm" title="And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and the Pelethites, and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule:">1 Kings 1:44</a>; yet they were not common soldiers, but probably the constant guards of David’s person; like the Prætorian bands among the Romans. Josephus calls them <span class="ital">keepers of the body, </span>or <span class="ital">body-guards, </span>who never departed from the place where the king was. That <span class="ital">Cherethites </span>is sometimes another word for <span class="ital">Philistines, </span>appears plainly from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; But, “that David’s guards were native Philistines, of his mortal enemies, is not to be imagined, even although we should suppose them proselytes. For how could their being proselyted more effectually recommend the fidelity of any men to him than being natives of his own country, and known and tried subjects? The only question, then, is, why any of his own subjects should be called Cherethites; and the answer is obvious. They were called so from their having gone with him into Philistia, and continued there with him all the time that he was under the protection of Achish. These were they who resorted to him from the beginning, in his utmost distress; and clave to him in all his calamities; and it is no wonder if men of such approved fidelity were in a more intimate degree of favour and confidence with the king, and enjoyed, among other privileges, an exemption from the authority of the captain-general, and were placed under peculiar commanders. And it will be no uncommon thing in the history of any country, to find legions and bands of soldiers, denominated, not from the place of their nativity, but that of their residence; as General Monk’s troops, who sojourned with him in Scotland, were called <span class="ital">Coldstreamers.” </span>— Delaney. The same author apprehends the Pelethites to have been another body of troops, made up of those valiant men who resorted to David when he resided at Ziklag, among whom we find one Pelet, the son of Azmaveth, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-3.htm" title="The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.">1 Chronicles 12:3</a>,) who, it is supposed, became their captain, and from whom they were called Pelethites, as the soldiers disciplined by Fabius and Iphicrates were called Fabians and Iphicratians. “Now, as the Cherethites adhered to David and followed his fortune from the beginning, they justly held the first degree of favour with him, and therefore they are always placed before the Pelethites, who only resorted to him when he was in Ziklag; and for that reason were only entitled to the second degree of favour.” See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1 Samuel 30:14</a>. It must be observed, however, that the Chaldee interpretation of these terms is, <span class="ital">archers </span>and <span class="ital">slingers, </span>an interpretation which is defended by a learned professor abroad, deriving the name <span class="ital">Cherethite </span>from <span class="ital">Caratha, </span>which, in the Arabic language, signifies <span class="ital">to hit the mark, </span>and <span class="ital">Pelethite, </span>from <span class="ital">pelet, </span>which in the same language, among other things, signifies to be <span class="ital">alert, </span>to <span class="ital">leap, </span>to <span class="ital">run swiftly. </span>The latter, therefore, he thinks, were soldiers chosen for their speed, and were light armed, like the Roman <span class="ital">velites, </span>who, with their other weapons, carried very light arrows, which were called <span class="ital">pelles, </span>and the use of which came from the East. <span class="ital">And David’s sons were chief rulers — </span>For so the Hebrew word, <span class="greekheb">כהנים</span>, <span class="ital">cohanim, </span>generally translated <span class="ital">priests, </span>must often be interpreted. Indeed it signifies any ministers, either of God or of man. David’s sons, being of the tribe of Judah, and not of the posterity of Aaron, could not be priests, according to the law. But they were among the principal officers of his court, the prime ministers of his household. Upon the whole, we find by this chapter that so long as David was zealous for the honour of God, and faithful in the discharge of his duty, God defended and protected him against his enemies, and blessed him with glory and happiness; but the scene changed when he provoked God by his sins, as we see in the sequel of his history. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:15-18 David neither did wrong, nor denied or delayed right to any.

To Him let us submit, his friendship let us seek, his service let us count our pleasure, diligently attending to the work he assigns to each of us.

They are supposed to be thus called, either, first, from their office, which was upon the king’s command to cut off or punish offenders, and to preserve the king’s person, as their names in the Hebrew tongue may seem to imply; or, secondly, from some country or place to which they had relation. As for the Cherethites, it is certain they were either a branch of the Philistines, or a people neighbouring to them, and confederate with them, as is manifest from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1 Samuel 30:14</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm" title="For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.">Zephaniah 2:4</a>,5</span>. And so might the Pelethites be too, though that be not related in Scripture. And these Israelites and soldiers of David might be so called, either because they went and lived with David when he dwelt in those parts; or from some notable exploit against or victory over these people; as among the Romans the names of Asiaticus, Africanus, &c. were given for the same reason.

These, according to Josephus (k), were the king's bodyguards, and this man is expressly said to be set over his guards, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-22.htm">2 Samuel 23:22</a>; and which some think were of the nation of the Philistines, famous for archery, and slinging of stones; and so the Targum renders it,"was appointed over the archers and slingers;''so "choriti" in Virgil (l) are quivers for arrows; the great use of which in fighting David had observed, and therefore got a select company of these men, partly to teach Israel, and partly to guard himself: but others are of opinion that David would never suffer such as were Heathens to be so near his person, and therefore take them to be Israelites; and so some Jewish writers say they were two families in Israel; which is much better than to interpret them as others do of the sanhedrim, and even of the Urim and Thummim, as in the Targum on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>; and it is most probable that they were Israelites, who were David's guards, and consisted of the chiefs that were with him in Philistia, and particularly at Ziklag, which lay on the south of the Cherethites, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>; and so had their name from thence; and among the chief of those that came to him at Ziklag there was one named Peleth, from whence might come the Pelethites, and they were all of them archers; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>, <p>and David's sons were chief rulers; princes, princes of the blood, or "chief about the king", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a>; they were constant attendants at court, waiting on the king, ready at hand to do what he pleased to order; they were the chief ministers, and had the management of the principal affairs at court. Abarbinel thinks that this respects not only David's sons, but Benaiah, and the family of the Cherethites and Pelethites, who had none of them particular posts assigned them, which were settled and known, as those before mentioned had, but were always near at hand, to do whatsoever the king commanded them; and which seems better to agree with the literal order and construction of the words; which are: <p>and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites, and Pelethites,  <p>and the sons of David, were princes, or chief rulers; or priests, who according to Gussetius (m) brought the offerings or presents to the king, and did that to him the priests did to the Lord. <p>(k) Ut supra.

In favour of the latter explanation it may be urged (<span class="ital">a</span>) that the names are gentilic in form; (<span class="ital">b</span>) that <span class="ital">Cherethites</span> certainly denotes a Philistine tribe in the other passages where it occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm" title="We made an invasion on the south of the Cherethites, and on the coast which belongs to Judah, and on the south of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire.">1 Samuel 30:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will stretch out my hand on the Philistines, and I will cut off the Cherethims, and destroy the remnant of the sea coast.">Ezekiel 25:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm" title="Woe to the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan, the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy you, that there shall be no inhabitant.">Zephaniah 2:5</a>); (<span class="ital">c</span>) that they are mentioned in conjunction with the Gittites in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-18.htm" title="And all his servants passed on beside him; and all the Cherethites, and all the Pelethites, and all the Gittites, six hundred men which came after him from Gath, passed on before the king.">2 Samuel 15:18</a>, so that David evidently had some foreign troops in his service, whom he had gathered round him during his residence at Ziklag.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">chief rulers</span>] <span class="bld">Ministers.</span> The word is that usually translated <span class="ital">priest</span>. It is derived from a root meaning <span class="ital">to serve</span> or <span class="ital">minister</span>, and in a few instances denotes a civil not an ecclesiastical minister, the king’s confidential adviser. Cp. the paraphrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm" title="And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the king.">1 Chronicles 18:17</a> “chief by the side of the king;” and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm" title="And Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers: and Zabud the son of Nathan was principal officer, and the king's friend:">1 Kings 4:5</a>, where the E. V. renders “principal officer.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 18.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Cherethites and the Pelethites.</span> As we have already seen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-14.htm">1 Samuel 30:14</a>), the Cherethim were an insignificant tribe inhabiting the southern part of the country of the Philistines. Nor is that place the only proof of this fact; for they are connected with the Philistines also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>. David made their acquaintance when at Ziklag; and probably the Pelethim dwelt in the same neighbourhood, and were a still more unimportant clan or family. Much ingenuity has been expended in finding for their names a Hebrew derivation, and Gesenius explains them as meaning "cutters and runners," though for the latter signification he has to go to the Arabic, where he finds a verb <span class="accented">falata</span>, "to run away," "flee." But this craze of explaining the names of aboriginal tribes and their towns by Hebrew words is not only absurd in itself, but bars the way to sounder knowledge. For it is possible that, by the study of names not belonging to the Hebrew language, we might arrive at some correct ideas about the races who had previously occupied Palestine. Instead of this, the whole system of derivation is corrupted, and philology made ridiculous. What can be more ludicrous than to explain these Pelethim as "runners away," unless it be the notion that the Rephaim took their name from the Hebrew word for "a ghost"? In his "mighties" David had a powerful bodyguard of native Israelites, and Saul previously had formed a similar force of three thousand men, not merely for the protection of his own person, but to guard the land from marauding incursions of Amalekites and other freebooting tribes. Such a body of men was of primary importance for police purposes and the safety of the frontiers. How useful such a force would be we can well understand from the history of the marches between England and Scotland (see also note on 2 Samuel 3:22); but I imagine that the Cherethites and Pelethites were used for humbler purposes. While "the mighties" guarded the frontiers, and kept the peace of the kingdom, these men would be used about the court and in Jerusalem, to execute the commands of the king and his great officers. Native Israelites would refuse such servile work, and the conquered Canaanites might become dangerous if trained and armed; while these foreigners, like the Swiss Guard in France, would be trustworthy and efficient. As for the true-born Israelites, they probably did not form the mass of the population, but, like the Franks in France, were the privileged and dominant race. We read that even from Egypt, besides their own dependents, there went up with Israel "a great mixture" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-38.htm">Exodus 12:38</a>, margin). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-4.htm">Numbers 11:4</a> these are even contemptuously designated by a word which answers to our "omnium gatherum;" yet even they, after the conquest of Palestine, would be higher in rank than the subjugated Canaanites, from whom, together with another "mixed multitude" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/13-3.htm">Nehemiah 13:3</a>, are descended the felahin of the present day. David's armies would be drawn from the Israelites, among whom were now reckoned the mixed multitude which went up from Egypt, and which was ennobled by taking part in the conquest of Canaan. In the army "the mighties" would hold the chief place; while the mercenaries, recruited from Ziklag and its neighbourhood, which continued to be David's private property (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>), would be most useful in the discharge of all kinds of administrative duty, and would also guard the king's person. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a> for <span class="accented">Cherethi</span> we find <span class="accented">Cheri</span>, which word also occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4, 19</a>. In the former passage the spelling is a mistake, the letter <span class="accented">t</span> having dropped out, and it is so regarded by the Jews, who read "Cherethi." The versions also translate there just as they do here, namely the Vulgate and LXX., "Cherethi and Pelethi;" and the Syriac by two nouns of somewhat similar sound to the Hebrew, and which signify "freemen and soldiers." In the latter place in Kings it is probable that some other tribe supplied the bodyguard in Queen Athaliah's time. <span class="cmt_word">David's sons were chief rulers;</span> Hebrew and Revised Version, <span class="accented">priests</span>. Similarly, in ch. 20:26, "Ira the Jairite was David's priest," Hebrew, <span class="accented">cohen</span>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a>, "Zabud was Solomon's priest." Gesenius and others suppose that they were domestic chaplains, not ministering according to the Levitical law, but invested with a sort of sacerdotal sacredness in honour of their birth. But if we look again at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-5.htm">1 Kings 4:5</a> we find "Zabud was priest, the king's friend;" and the latter words seem to be an explanation of the title <span class="accented">cohen</span>, added because the word in this sense was already becoming obsolete.  In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-17.htm">1 Chronicles 18:17</a> the language is completely changed, and we read, "and David's sons were chief at the king's hand." We may feel sure that the Chronicler knew what was the meaning of the phrase in the Books of Samuel, and that he was also aware that it had gone out of use, and therefore gave instead the right sense. Evidently the word cohen had at first a wider significance, and meant a "minister and confidant." He was the officer who stood next to his master, and knew his purpose and saw to its execution. And this was the meaning of the term when applied to the confidential minister of Jehovah, whose duty it was to execute his will according to the commands given in the Law; but when so used it gradually became too sacred for ordinary employment. Still, there is a divinity about a king, and so his confidants and the officers nearest to his person were still called cohens; and we find the phrase lingering on for another century and a half. For Jehu puts to death, not only Ahab's great men and kinsfolk, but also "his cohens," the men who had been his intimate friends (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-11.htm">2 Kings 10:11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David also sanctified Toi's presents to the Lord (handed them over to the treasury of the sanctuary), together with the silver and gold which he had sanctified from all the conquered nations, from Aram, Moab, etc. Instead of &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; the text of the Chronicles has &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which he took, i.e., took as booty. Both are equally correct; there is simply a somewhat different turn given to the thought.<p>(Note: Bertheau erroneously maintains that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, which he took, is at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>, as, according to this passage, the golden shields of Hadadezer did not become the property of the Lord. But there is not a word to that effect in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-7.htm">2 Samuel 8:7</a>. On the contrary, his taking the shields to Jerusalem implies, rather than precludes, the intention to devote them to the purposes of the sanctuary.)<p>In the enumeration of the conquered nations in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>, the text of the Chronicles differs from that of the book before us. In the first place, we find "from Edom" instead of "from Aram;" and secondly, the clause "and of the spoil of Hadadezer, son of Rehob king of Zobah," is altogether wanting there. The text of the Chronicles is certainly faulty here, as the name of Aram (Syria) could not possibly be omitted. Edom could much better be left out, not "because the conquest of Edom belonged to a later period," as Movers maintains, but because the conquest of Edom is mentioned for the first time in the subsequent verses. But if we bear in mind that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a> of both texts not only are those tribes enumerated the conquest of which had been already noticed, but all the tribes that David ever defeated and subjugated, even the Ammonites and Amalekites, to the war with whom no allusion whatever is made in the present chapter, we shall see that Edom could not be omitted. Consequently "from Syria" must have dropped out of the text of the Chronicles, and "from Edom" out of the one before us; so that the text in both instances ran originally thus, "from Syria, and from Edom, and from Moab." For even in the text before us, "from Aram" (Syria) could not well be omitted, notwithstanding the fact that the booty of Hadadezer is specially mentioned at the close of the verse, for the simple reason that David not only made war upon Syria-Zobah (the kingdom of Hadadezer) and subdued it, but also upon Syria-Damascus, which was quite independent of Zobah. </body></html>
