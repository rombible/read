David subdued the Philistines. They had long been troublesome to Israel. And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have with the powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son of David shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more than conquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Let the line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians.

Damascus (written Darmesek in marginal references, according to the late Aramean orthography) is first mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-2.htm">Genesis 15:2</a>. According to Nicolaus of Damascus, cited by Josephus, the Syrian king's name was Hadad. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 8:3-14. He Smites Hadadezer and the Syrians.<p>3. Zobah&#8212;(1Ch 18:3). This kingdom was bounded on the east by the Euphrates, and it extended westward from that river, perhaps as far north as Aleppo. It was long the chief among the petty kingdoms of Syria, and its king bore the hereditary title of "Hadadezer" or "Hadarezer" ("Hadad," that is, "helped").<p>as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates&#8212;in accordance with the promises God made to Israel that He would give them all the country as far as the Euphrates (Ge 15:18; Nu 24:17). In the first campaign David signally defeated Hadadezer. Besides a great number of foot prisoners, he took from him an immense amount of booty in chariots and horses. Reserving only a small number of the latter, he hamstrung the rest. The horses were thus mutilated because they were forbidden to the Hebrews, both in war and agriculture. So it was of no use to keep them. Besides, their neighbors placed much dependence on cavalry, but having, for want of a native breed, to procure them by purchase, the greatest damage that could be done to such enemies was to render their horses unserviceable in war. (See also Ge 46:6; Jos 11:6, 9). A king of Damascene-Syria came to Hadadezer's succor; but David routed those auxiliary forces also, took possession of their country, put garrisons into their fortified towns, and made them tributary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Syrians of Damascus, </span> i. e. who were subject to Damascus, the chief city of Syria. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when the Syrians of Damascus came to succour Hadadezer king of Zobah,....

It did not long remain subject to them. In Solomon’s reign a certain Rezon established himself at Damascus, and proved a troublesome enemy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-23.htm" title="And God stirred him up another adversary, Rezon the son of Eliadah, which fled from his lord Hadadezer king of Zobah:...">1 Kings 11:23-25</a>). Benhadad I. was bribed by Asa to break his league with Baasha and invade the Israelite territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm" title="Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and delivered them into the hand of his servants: and king Asa sent them to Benhadad, the son of Tabrimon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, that dwelled at Damascus, saying,">1 Kings 15:18</a>), and actually built a Syrian quarter in Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.">1 Kings 20:34</a>). His son and successor Ben-hadad II. besieged Samaria (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm" title="And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.">1 Kings 20:1</a>), but was defeated, and compelled to submit to Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-34.htm" title="And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities, which my father took from your father, I will restore; and you shall make streets for you in Damascus, as my father made in Samaria. Then said Ahab, I will send you away with this covenant. So he made a covenant with him, and sent him away.">1 Kings 20:34</a>). But the defeat and death of Ahab at Ramoth-gilead again gave Syria the upper hand (1 Kings 22); and in the reign of Jehoram Samaria was once more besieged by them, and only saved by a miraculous interposition (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Benhadad king of Syria gathered all his host, and went up, and besieged Samaria.">2 Kings 6:24</a> to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-20.htm" title="And so it fell out to him: for the people stepped on him in the gate, and he died.">2 Kings 7:20</a>). The rising power of Assyria now began to threaten Syria, but in spite of the defeats he suffered from it, the usurper Hazael, succeeding in repulsing the combined forces of Judah and Israel at Ramoth-gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/8-28.htm" title="And he went with Joram the son of Ahab to the war against Hazael king of Syria in Ramothgilead; and the Syrians wounded Joram....">2 Kings 8:28-29</a>), ravaged the trans-Jordanic territory of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/10-32.htm" title="In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;...">2 Kings 10:32-33</a>), captured Gath, and threatened Jerusalem, which only escaped on payment of a heavy ransom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/12-17.htm" title="Then Hazael king of Syria went up, and fought against Gath, and took it: and Hazael set his face to go up to Jerusalem....">2 Kings 12:17-18</a>), and seriously reduced the power of the Northern Kingdom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/13-3.htm" title="And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of Hazael king of Syria, and into the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael, all their days....">2 Kings 13:3-7</a>). Joash, however, recovered the lost territory (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/13-25.htm" title="And Jehoash the son of Jehoahaz took again out of the hand of Benhadad the son of Hazael the cities, which he had taken out of the hand of Jehoahaz his father by war. Three times did Joash beat him, and recovered the cities of Israel.">2 Kings 13:25</a>), and Jeroboam II. extended his conquests to Damascus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm" title="Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, and all that he did, and his might, how he warred, and how he recovered Damascus, and Hamath, which belonged to Judah, for Israel, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?">2 Kings 14:28</a>). Three quarters of a century later Syria reappears as the ally of Israel against Judah. Rezin, king of Damascus, made a league with Pekah to depose Ahaz and set up a creature of their own in his stead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-5.htm" title="Then Rezin king of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to war: and they besieged Ahaz, but could not overcome him.">2 Kings 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it....">Isaiah 7:1-9</a>); but their attempt to take Jerusalem failed, and Ahaz persuaded Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria, to attack Syria. Rezin was slain and Damascus destroyed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_kings/16-7.htm" title="So Ahaz sent messengers to Tiglathpileser king of Assyria, saying, I am your servant and your son: come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against me....">2 Kings 16:7-9</a>). Damascus now disappears from the O.T. history; but by the fourth century b. c. it had been rebuilt. and has maintained its prosperity down to the present day. It is situated in a fertile plain watered by the river <span class="ital">Barada</span>, which is probably the Abana of Scripture, to the E. of the great mountain chain of the Anti-Libanus, on the edge of the desert. Travellers describe it as “embosomed in a wide forest of fruit trees, intersected and surrounded by sparkling streams, in the midst of an earthly paradise.” This natural beauty and fertility, combined with its importance as a centre of trade, have secured the permanence of its prosperity for nearly 4,000 years. See Robinson’s <span class="ital">Biblical Researches</span>, III. 443 ff; Stanley’s <span class="ital">Sinai and Palestine</span>, p. 414 ff.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">The Syrians of Damascus;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Aram-Dammesek</span>; that is, Aram-Damascus. The inhabitants of these regions and of Mesopotamia were descended from Aram, the son of Shem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-22.htm">Genesis 10:22</a>), and bore his name. Thus Zobah is called Aram-Zobah in the title of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>. As members of a kindred race, and speaking the same language, all the clans of the Aramean family would naturally combine to check the growing power of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then briefly sums up the two parts of his prayer of thanksgiving in the two clauses commencing with &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, "and now." - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-28.htm">2 Samuel 7:28</a> he sums up the contents of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-18.htm">2 Samuel 7:18-24</a> by celebrating the greatness of the Lord and His promise; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-29.htm">2 Samuel 7:29</a> the substance of the prayer in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25-27</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1498; &#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1500;, may it please Thee to bless (&#1492;&#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-5.htm">Deuteronomy 1:5</a>).
