He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line. Let the line of mercy be stretched to the utmost. He smote the Syrians.

After David had rest from his enemies for a time, and after the conversation he had had with Nathan about building the house of God, and after the message sent to him from the Lord by that prophet, forbidding him to build, and David's prayer to the Lord upon it, the following events happened; and which are recorded to show that David's rest from his enemies did not last long, and that he had other work to do than to build the house of God: <p>that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them; these had been long and implacable enemies of Israel; Samson began to weaken them in his days; a war was waged between them and Israel in the times of Samuel and Saul, and the battle sometimes went on one side and sometimes on the other; but now David made an entire conquest of them: before they had used to come into the land of Israel, and there fight with Israel, but now David entered into their land, and took it from them: <p>and David took Methegammah out of the hands of the Philistines; the name of a province in Palestine, and from the parallel place in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>, it appears to be Gath, and its adjacent towns; but why that was called the bridle of Ammah, or the bridle of a cubit, as it may be rendered, is not easy to say. The conjecture of Kimchi is, that there was a pool or river of water, so Ammah is thought to signify; and Aquila renders it a water course, which passed through the city, having been brought from without it into it, the communication of which from place to place it may be David cut off, by stopping or turning its stream; but interpreters more generally suppose that Gath was built upon an hill called Ammah, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-24.htm">2 Samuel 2:24</a>; thought to be the same with the Amgaris of Pliny (d) though that is sometimes read Angaris, a mountain he places in Palestine; and that it was called Metheg, a bridle, because being a frontier city, and being very strong and powerful, erected into a kingdom, it was a curb and bridle upon the Israelites; but now David taking it out of their hands, opened his way for the more easy subduing the rest of their country: or the word may be rendered Metheg and her mother, that is, Gath, the metropolis, since that and her daughters, or towns, are said to be taken, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>; and Metheg might be one of them. <p>(d) Nat.

The Development of David’s Kingdom<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>&nbsp;= 1 Chronicles 18<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1, 2. Conquest of the Philistines and Moabites<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">1</span>. <span class="ital">And after this it came to pass</span>] This chapter contains a summary account of the wars by which David established the supremacy of Israel among the surrounding nations. At what periods of his reign they were waged is not stated. As has been already implied in the note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when the king sat in his house, and the LORD had given him rest round about from all his enemies;">2 Samuel 7:1</a>, it seems best to consider the words “and after this it came to pass” as a general formula of transition and connexion, not necessarily indicating a strict chronological sequence. It may possibly be derived from the annals which were the original source of the history. Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.">2 Samuel 10:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that Absalom the son of David had a fair sister, whose name was Tamar; and Amnon the son of David loved her.">2 Samuel 13:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">took Metheg-ammah</span>, &c.] The most probable explanation of this obscure expression is <span class="ital">took the bridle of the metropolis out of the hand of the Philistines</span>, i.e. wrested from them the control of their chief city. This is equivalent to the statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm" title="Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines.">1 Chronicles 18:1</a> that “David took Gath and her towns out of the hand of the Philistines;” and it may be noticed that the metaphor of the ‘mother-city’ is employed there, for the word translated “towns” literally means <span class="ital">daughters</span>. Gath was allowed to retain its king as a tributary (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-39.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish son of Maachah king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, your servants be in Gath.">1 Kings 2:39</a>). On its site and history see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/5-8.htm" title="They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried the ark of the God of Israel about thither.">1 Samuel 5:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 1.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">David smote the Philistines.</span> In the previous chapter we have seen that the empire of David not only marked an era in the development of Israel nationally, but was also the reaching of a new stage in the preparation for the advent of the Messiah; and we saw that without this the development of prophecy would have been impossible, and the people have remained unfit for the high mission to which they were called as the witnesses to the unity of Cod. We have in this chapter a brief summary of the wars which raised Israel from the position of a struggling and oppressed race to the possession of widespread empire. With this narrative the first history of David ends, and in the subsequent narratives many of the events referred to here are more fully detailed, and given with additional incidents. <span class="cmt_word">David took Metheg-ammah out of the hand of the Philistines.</span> Metheg-ammah means "the bridle of the mother city." We learn from the parallel place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-1.htm">1 Chronicles 18:1</a>) that the city of Gath is meant by this phrase. Gath was at this time the metropolis of Philistia, and had reduced the other four chief towns to a state of vassalage. Thus by taking Gath, his old city of refuge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>), David acquired also the supremacy which she had previously exercised over the whole country, and by placing a strong garrison there, as previously  the Philistines had done in the towns of Israel, he kept that martial race in awe. It denotes great progress in the arts of war that David could besiege and capture a town so strong as Gath. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Thou hast established to thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever: and Thou, Jehovah, hast become a God to them." The first clause does not refer merely to the liberation of Israel out of Egypt, or to the conquest of Canaan alone, but to all that the Lord had done for the establishment of Israel as the people of His possession, from the time of Moses till His promise of the eternal continuance of the throne of David. Jehovah had thereby become God to the nation of Israel, i.e., had thereby attested and proved himself to be its God.<p>To this praise of the acts of the Lord there is attached in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25</a>. the prayer for the fulfilment of His glorious promise. Would Jehovah set up (i.e., carry out) the word which He had spoken to His servant that His name might be great, i.e., be glorified, through its being said, "The Lord of Sabaoth is God over Israel," and "the house of Thy servant will be firm before Thee." The prayer is expressed in the form of confident assurance.</body></html>
