The course of affairs appears to have been as follows:—the war was originally undertaken against the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/10-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after this, that the king of the children of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead.">2Samuel 10:1-12</a>), who had obtained the aid of the Syrians.

David first inflicted a crushing defeat upon the allies near Hamath, and then “returned” to the south, where he again met them in “the valley of salt”—the <span class= "ital">Arabalt </span>south of the Dead Sea, this latter army being naturally chiefly composed of Edomites, and so called in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1Chronicles 18:12</a>, and in the title of Psalms 60, but here spoken of as Syrians because the whole confederacy is called by the name of its most powerful member. David himself returned from the southern campaign; but what was done by his general, Abishai, under his orders, is naturally said to have been done by him. Meantime, when this first battle, attended with the slaughter of 18,000 men, had been won by Abishai, Joab, the general-in-chief, being set free by the victories in the north, gained another battle in the same locality, killing 12,000 (Psalms 60, title). The power of Edom was now completely broken, and the whole forces of Israel were mustered under Joab to overrun their country and destroy all its male inhabitants (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-15.htm" title="For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;">1Kings 11:15-16</a>), certain of them, however, excepted (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-17.htm" title="That Hadad fled, he and certain Edomites of his father's servants with him, to go into Egypt; Hadad being yet a little child.">1Kings 11:17</a>), and their descendants in after ages were relentless foes of Israel. (Comp. the prophecy of Isaac, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-40.htm" title="And by your sword shall you live, and shall serve your brother; and it shall come to pass when you shall have the dominion, that you shall break his yoke from off your neck.">Genesis 27:40</a>.)<p>In this summary of David’s reign the historian here turns from his wars and victories over other nations to the internal affairs of his kingdom. Substantially the same list of officers is again given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-23.htm" title="Now Joab was over all the host of Israel: and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites:">2Samuel 20:23-26</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:9-14 All the precious things David was master of, were dedicated things; they were designed for building the temple.

Thus, in the conquest of a soul by the grace of the Son of David, what stands in opposition to God must be destroyed, every lust must be mortified and crucified, but what may glorify him must be dedicated; thus the property of it is altered. God employs his servants in various ways; some, as David, in spiritual battles; others, as Solomon, in spiritual buildings; and one prepares work for the other, that God may have the glory of all.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Syrians - Read the Edomites, as in marginal references (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a> title), and as the context <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-14.htm">2 Samuel 8:14</a> requires.

The war with Edom was of some duration, not without serious reverses and dangers to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a> note).

David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians&#8212;Instead of Syrians, the Septuagint version reads "Edomites," which is the true reading, as is evident from 2Sa 8:14. This conquest, made by the army of David, was due to the skilful generalship and gallantry of Abishai and Joab. (1Ch 18:12; compare Ps 60:1, title.) The valley was the ravine of salt (the Ghor), adjoining the Salt Mountain, at the southwestern extremity of the Dead Sea, separating the ancient territories of Judah and Edom [Robinson].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Gat him a name, </span> i.e. much increased his reputation. <span class="ital">The Syrians</span>, or <span class="ital">Edomites</span>, as they are said to be, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1 Chronicles 18:12</a></span>. It is likely these two people were confederates, and that divers of the Syrians whom David had defeated in Syria fled to Edom, and there joined with them against their common enemy, and made up together a very great army, (as the number of the men slain in it showeth,) consisting of the veteran soldiers of both countries; although the slaughter here following may seem not to have been of the Syrians, as the words at first reading seem to intimate, but of the Edomites; (it not being probable that the Syrians would come so far from their own country, as to the valley of salt, to fight;) and this verse may be read thus, and that very agreeably to the Hebrew: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And David gat him a name when he returned from smiting of the Syrians, </span> in smiting (which is easily repeated out of the last clause, according to the common usage of Scripture) <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the valley of salt eighteen thousand men, </span> who were <span class="ital">Edomites</span>, as is sufficiently implied here in the next verse, and expressed <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm" title="Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in the valley of salt eighteen thousand.">1 Chronicles 18:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The valley of salt; </span> a place in Edom so called, either from its neighbourhood to the Salt Sea, or for some other cause now unknown.

But why may not that be another history and battle? So the Edomites and Syrians together did first fight with Abishai, and lost 18,000 men, and afterwards recruited their forces and fought with Joab, and lost other 12,000 men. Nor is it strange if two battles were fought in one place; of which there are divers instances in historians. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/8.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David gat him a name,.... Fame and reputation in the several nations of the world for valour and courage, for the many and signal victories that he obtained; the Jewish writers generally refer this to his humanity in burying the dead bodies of his enemies slain in war, which gained him great esteem among all, and even his very enemies; but nothing of that kind is pointed at here, but his conquests: or "he made himself a name"; erected a triumphal arch (b) in memory of his victories: <p>when he returned from smiting of the Syrians in the valley of salt,  <p>being eighteen thousand men; in the relation of this fact in different places some difficulties arise, both as to the people smitten, and their numbers, and by whom; in this place they are said to be Syrians, but in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, and in the title of <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1</a>, which was composed on account of these victories, they are called Edomites, and said to be of Edom; which may be reconciled by observing, that the Syrians and Edomites were confederates in this war; and that whereas the latter were auxiliaries to the former, the whole body of the army might be called Syrians, of which twenty two thousand were slain that were properly Syrians, and eighteen thousand Edomites, in all forty thousand; which was a very great slaughter: or the sense is, that when he had smitten the twenty two thousand Syrians, and was upon the return, he met with a body of Edomites, who came to the assistance of the Syrians, and he slew eighteen thousand of them; and the Jews say, as Jarchi observes, there were two battles; and if so, this would remove all the difficulties started; as for the numbers slain, here eighteen thousand, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1</a>, twelve thousand, it is reconciled by observing, that Abishai first began the attack upon the Edomites, and slew six thousand of them; and then Joab fell upon them, and slew twelve thousand more, in all eighteen thousand; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>, this slaughter is ascribed to Abishai, because he began it, even the whole number; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1</a>, to Joab, the twelve thousand slain by him, who seconded Abishai; and the whole is here attributed to David, because he was king, under whom Abishai and Joab served as generals: and no less difficult is it to ascertain the place where this slaughter was made, called "the valley of salt": it seems by our text that it was in Syria, but in other places as if it was in Edom; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>; but in Edom itself is no such valley to be found, though there is in Syria; one traveller (c) tells us, that in the way from Aleppo to the banks of Euphrates are many villages, among which is one of note, called Tedith, famous for a synod held here by the Jews, in the year from the creation 3498, of which Ezra was the scribe; when were placed the books of the Old Testament in the order in which they now are; and near this town, he says, is the valley of salt, memorable for the victory here recorded: others say (d) about three or four hours' journey from Aleppo is the valley of salt, near which is a salt spring, whose waters running over the place leave, when dried by the sun, a great quantity of excellent salt; this salt is thrown together in the Gabboul, or salt house; but by others (e) we are informed, that near about an hour's distance from the city of Tadmor, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-18.htm">1 Kings 9:18</a> <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-3.htm">2 Chronicles 8:3</a>, is to be seen a large valley of salt, affording great quantities thereof; and it is thought that this is more probably the valley of salt mentioned here, than another which lies about four hours from Aleppo, and has sometimes passed for it; and which the above accounts show: but a modern writer (f), in his account of Palmyra, the same with Tadmor, speaks of a great plain, all covered with salt, from whence the whole country round is supplied. This plain is about a league from Palmyra, and extends itself towards the eastern part of Idumea (or Edom) the capital city of which was Bozra; and indeed this valley being both in Syria, and reaching to the borders of Edom, bids fair to be the valley here spoken of. <p>(b) So Hieron.

This, and not “erected a monument,” as some render, is the right meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when he returned from smiting of the Syrians</span>] The text is certainly corrupt. Chr. reads, “And Abishai the son of Zeruiah smote Edom in the valley of salt, (to the number of) eighteen thousand men.” The Sept. has, “And David made a name: and as he returned he smote Edom in Gebelem [a corrupt transliteration of the words meaning <span class="ital">valley of salt</span>] to the number of eighteen thousand.” Moreover the Valley of Salt was nowhere in the neighbourhood of Syria, but on the ancient border between Judah and Edom, to the S. of the Dead Sea. It was the scene of Amaziah’s victory over the Edomites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm" title="He slew of Edom in the valley of salt ten thousand, and took Selah by war, and called the name of it Joktheel to this day.">2 Kings 14:7</a>). We must therefore either adopt the Sept. reading, or insert after <span class="ital">Syrians</span> the words <span class="ital">and he smote Edom</span>, which may easily have dropped out, as the second of two similarly ending clauses.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Psalms 60 is referred to this occasion by its title; “Michtam of David. When he fought with Aram of the two rivers [Mesopotamia] and Aram of Zobah, and Joab returned and smote Edom in the Valley of Salt (to the number of) twelve thousand men.” The genuineness of this title is disputed, chiefly on the ground that the Psalm speaks of heavy disasters, of which there is no mention in the history. But we should scarcely expect defeat to be chronicled in such an extremely brief summary as the present, which records only the final results of the war. We may conjecture that while David was occupied with his campaign against the Ammonites and Syrians, Edom seized the opportunity for invading the south of Judah, and succeeded in inflicting serious damage, until David sent back part of his forces under Joab or Abishai, and repulsed their attack, following up his victory by the complete subjugation of Edom. We learn further from <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/11-15.htm" title="For it came to pass, when David was in Edom, and Joab the captain of the host was gone up to bury the slain, after he had smitten every male in Edom;...">1 Kings 11:15-16</a>, that the war was pursued with relentless severity, and signal vengeance taken upon the Edomites. That the successful campaign is here attributed to David, in Chr. to Abishai, in the Psalm and in 1 Kings to Joab, need cause no difficulty. David was concerned in it as king, Joab as general of the army, Abishai probably as commander of the division sent forward in advance. The variations as to the number of slain, here put at 18,000, in the Psalm at 12,000, may be due either to a textual error, or to some difference in the mode of reckoning.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">From smiting of the Syrians;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">of Aram.</span> Here "Edom" is certainly right (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>), unless we accept Keil's conjecture, and suppose that "he smote Edom" has dropped out of the text, and must be inserted. In the superscription of Psalm we find the wars with Aram-Naharaim (Mesopotamia) and Aram-Zobah coupled with this smiting of Edom in the valley of salt, which lay to the south of the Dead Sea, and was a fatal place to the Edomitos in their war subsequently with Amaziah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>). Such a double victory over the Arameans first, and immediately afterwards over Edom, would account for the "name," that is, the reputation, which David gained. The course of events seems to have been as follows. The Edomites, believing that David was engaged in a struggle beyond his powers with the Syrians, took the opportunity to invade Israel. But the campaign in Aram was quickly decided, and David was able to send Abishai with a detachment of his forces to repel the Edomites. On hearing of his approach, they retired before him, and, making a stand in their own territories, were defeated in the valley of salt, with the loss of eighteen thousand men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-12.htm">1 Chronicles 18:12</a>). In this place the victory is ascribed to David, because it was won by his general acting under his orders. For some unexplained reason, the feelings of the Israelites against Edom were very vindictive, and Joab followed with larger forces, and not only slew twelve thousand in a second battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60.htm">Psalm 60</a>, title), but remained six months in the country, ruthlessly putting every male to death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15, 16</a>). From this time the Edomites and Israelites were implacable foes, and in later Jewish literature the Jews gave vent to their intense hatred of the Roman empire by giving it the name of Edom. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Of the booty taken in these wars, David carried the golden shields which he took from the servants, i.e., the governors and vassal princes, of Hadadezer, to Jerusalem.<p>(Note: The lxx has this additional clause: "And Shishak the king of Egypt took them away, when he went up against Jerusalem in the days of Rehoboam the son of Solomon," which is neither to be found in the Chronicles nor in any other ancient version, and is merely an inference drawn by the Greek translator, or by some copyists of the lxx, from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-25.htm">1 Kings 14:25-28</a>, taken in connection with the fact that the application of the brass is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-8.htm">1 Chronicles 18:8</a>. But, in the first place, the author of this gloss has overlooked the fact that the golden shields of Rehoboam which Shishak carried away, were not those captured by David, but those which Solomon had had made, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-16.htm">1 Kings 10:16</a>, for the retainers of his palace; and in the second place, he has not observed that, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a> of this chapter, and also of the Chronicles, David dedicated to the Lord all the gold and silver that he had taken, i.e., put it in the treasury of the sanctuary to be reserved for the future temple, and that at the end of his reign he handed over to his son and successor Solomon all the gold, silver, iron, and brass that he had collected for the purpose, to be applied to the building of the temple (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-14.htm">1 Chronicles 22:14</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-2.htm">1 Chronicles 29:2</a>.).
