And after the long and frequent struggles the saints have with the powers of darkness, like Israel with the Philistines, the Son of David shall tread them all under foot, and make the saints more than conquerors. He smote the Moabites, and made them tributaries to Israel. Two parts he destroyed, the third part he spared. The line that was to keep alive, though it was but one, is ordered to be a full line.

Hadadezer, is the true form, as seen in the names Benhadad, Hadad (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-18.htm">1 Kings 15:18</a>, etc.; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>, etc.). Hadad was the chief idol, or sun-god, of the Syrians.<p>To recover his border - literally, to cause his hand to return. The phrase is used sometimes literally, as e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-7.htm">Exodus 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/13-4.htm">1 Kings 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-24.htm">Proverbs 19:24</a>; and sometimes figuratively, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-25.htm">Isaiah 1:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-27.htm">Isaiah 14:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-11.htm">Psalm 74:11</a>. The exact force of the metaphor must in each case be decided by the context. If, as is most probable, this verse relates to the circumstances more fully detailed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-15.htm">2 Samuel 10:15-19</a>, the meaning of the phrase here will be when he (Hadadezer) went to renew his attack (upon Israel), or to recruit his strength against Israel, at the river Euphrates. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 8:3-14. He Smites Hadadezer and the Syrians.<p>3. Zobah&#8212;(1Ch 18:3). This kingdom was bounded on the east by the Euphrates, and it extended westward from that river, perhaps as far north as Aleppo. It was long the chief among the petty kingdoms of Syria, and its king bore the hereditary title of "Hadadezer" or "Hadarezer" ("Hadad," that is, "helped").<p>as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates&#8212;in accordance with the promises God made to Israel that He would give them all the country as far as the Euphrates (Ge 15:18; Nu 24:17). In the first campaign David signally defeated Hadadezer. Besides a great number of foot prisoners, he took from him an immense amount of booty in chariots and horses. Reserving only a small number of the latter, he hamstrung the rest. The horses were thus mutilated because they were forbidden to the Hebrews, both in war and agriculture. So it was of no use to keep them. Besides, their neighbors placed much dependence on cavalry, but having, for want of a native breed, to procure them by purchase, the greatest damage that could be done to such enemies was to render their horses unserviceable in war. (See also Ge 46:6; Jos 11:6, 9). A king of Damascene-Syria came to Hadadezer's succor; but David routed those auxiliary forces also, took possession of their country, put garrisons into their fortified towns, and made them tributary.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Hadadezer, </span> called <span class="ital">Hadarezer</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm" title="And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.">1 Chronicles 18:3</a></span>, the Hebrew letters <span class="ital">daleth</span> and <span class="ital">reseh</span> being alike, and so oft interchanged. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Zobah; </span> a part of Syria, lying north-east from Canaan, towards Hamath, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm" title="And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.">1 Chronicles 18:3</a></span>.

Called sometimes Aramzobah, and was a part of Syria, as its name shows. Benjamin, of Tudela (h) takes it to be the same with Haleb or Aleppo; Josephus (i) calls it Sophene; but that is placed by Ptolemy (k) beyond the Euphrates; whereas this country must be between that river and the land of Israel, and was contiguous to it, and near Damascus; and it was so near the land of Israel, and being conquered by David, that it became a controversy with the Jews, whether it was not to be reckoned part of it, and in several things they allow it to be equal to it (l). Rehob was the first king of this part of Syria, and then his son the second and last; he is called Hadarezer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>; the letters "D" and "R", being frequently changed in the Hebrew tongue: him David fought with, and overcame: <p>as he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates; which some understand of Hadadezer, so Jarchi and Kimchi, who attempted to recover part of his dominions that had been taken by some one or another from him, which lay upon the river Euphrates; or he endeavoured to enlarge his dominions, and carry them as far as the river, and establish the borders of them; and while he was doing this, or attempting it, David fell upon him, and routed him; or rather this refers to David, who considering that the ancient border of the land of Israel, as given to Abraham, reached to the river Euphrates, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-18.htm">Genesis 15:18</a>; he set out on an expedition to recover this border, and whereas the country of this king lay in his way, he invaded that; upon which Hadadezer rose up against him, and was conquered by him, and by this means the border was recovered to the kingdom of Israel, and reached so far, as is plain it did in Solomon's time, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>. <p>(h) Itinerar. p. 59.

It seems to have been north-east of Damascus and south of Hamath, between the Orontes and Euphrates. Saul waged wars with its “kings,” who were probably independent chieftains (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm" title="So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines: and wherever he turned himself, he vexed them.">1 Samuel 14:47</a>), but now it was consolidated under one ruler, and was a country of considerable wealth and power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to recover his border</span>] The phrase cannot be thus rendered, but means probably either <span class="bld">to renew his attack</span> or <span class="bld">to re-establish his power.</span> The parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm" title="And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah to Hamath, as he went to establish his dominion by the river Euphrates.">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> has a different verb, meaning <span class="ital">to set up his power</span>. The subject of the sentence is Hadadezer, and the occasion referred to is probably that which is described more fully in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/10-15.htm" title="And when the Syrians saw that they were smitten before Israel, they gathered themselves together....">2 Samuel 10:15-19</a>. The Ammonites had hired the Syrians to help them against David, who defeated their combined forces. Hadadezer thereupon summoned the Syrians from beyond the Euphrates to his assistance, but was totally defeated.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">at the river Euphrates</span>] <span class="ital">Euphrates</span> is not in the written text, but according to the Jewish tradition is to be read (see Introd. p. 15). But the addition is unnecessary. “The River” by itself was understood to mean the Euphrates. Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm" title="And Hadarezer sent, and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river: and they came to Helam; and Shobach the captain of the host of Hadarezer went before them.">2 Samuel 10:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-8.htm" title="He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.">Psalm 72:8</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Hadadezer</span>. The name is spelt Hadarezer in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a> and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a>, and such is the reading of the versions here and of many Hebrew manuscripts. The other reading has been defended on the ground that Hadad is the name of the Syrian sun-god, but the cuneiform inscriptions show that his real name was Hadar. The King of Syria, mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm">1 Kings 20:1</a>, is called in Assyrian Ben-Hidri. <span class="cmt_word">Zobah</span>. Ewald identifies Zobah with the "Sabo" mentioned by Ptolemy. This is uncertain, but evidently Zobah lay northeast of Damascus and south of Hamath, in the region between the rivers Orontes and Euphrates. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> it appears as a powerless country governed by a multitude of petty kings; but evidently now Hadarezer had made himself supreme, and become a powerful monarch whose authority extended even across the river into Mesopotamia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-16.htm">2 Samuel 10:16</a>). Having crushed his rivals at home, he had next endeavoured to extend his dominion abroad. <span class="cmt_word">As he went to recover his border at the river Euphrates.</span> The word "Euphrates" is inserted in the Authorized Version, because the margin says, "Euphrates read but not written." In the Revised Version it is omitted, because the unauthoritative nature of these directions to read something not in the text has been demonstrated. Technically these readings are called <span class="accented">K'ri</span>, and the written text <span class="accented">K'tib.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> the reading is, "as he went to stablish his dominion by the river" - a change which involves the alteration of only one letter, as the word rendered here "his border," and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/18-3.htm">1 Chronicles 18:3</a> "his dominion," is the same, signifying literally, "his hand." For this reason the Revised Version renders it correctly in both places "his dominion." Now, David never had possessed up to this time any dominion upon the Euphrates, but in the fuller narrative in ch. 10. we learn that these Syrians of Zobah had sent powerful reinforcements to the Ammonites in their war with David; and he might reasonably, therefore, determine to follow up his victory over. them by extending his power up to the river, so as to guard the fords, and prevent all future invasions. And this Hadarezer would resent. As an able and enterprising man, he had succeeded in making Zobah a powerful realm, and was not likely to submit to having a bridle put upon his adventurous spirit by the posting of an Israelitish garrison on the borders. We learn from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-19.htm">2 Samuel 10:19</a> that David's object was to prevent aid coming to Ammon from Zobah, and that he succeeded in putting a barrier in Hadarezer's way. We can scarcely doubt, therefore, that the reading in the Chronicles is to be preferred. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-47.htm">1 Samuel 14:47</a> we read that Saul had waged war with Zobah, and as David had probably served in it, he would have thereby acquired both a knowledge of the country, very useful in this present more serious expedition, and also have learned the necessity of guarding his dominions against perpetual invasions from that quarter.  <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And Thou hast established to thyself Thy people Israel to be a people unto Thee for ever: and Thou, Jehovah, hast become a God to them." The first clause does not refer merely to the liberation of Israel out of Egypt, or to the conquest of Canaan alone, but to all that the Lord had done for the establishment of Israel as the people of His possession, from the time of Moses till His promise of the eternal continuance of the throne of David. Jehovah had thereby become God to the nation of Israel, i.e., had thereby attested and proved himself to be its God.<p>To this praise of the acts of the Lord there is attached in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-25.htm">2 Samuel 7:25</a>. the prayer for the fulfilment of His glorious promise. Would Jehovah set up (i.e., carry out) the word which He had spoken to His servant that His name might be great, i.e., be glorified, through its being said, "The Lord of Sabaoth is God over Israel," and "the house of Thy servant will be firm before Thee." The prayer is expressed in the form of confident assurance.</body></html>
