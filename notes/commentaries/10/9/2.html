Yet persons of real godliness will have no rest till they have discharged them. And the most proper objects of kindness and charity, frequently will not be found without inquiry. Jonathan was David's sworn friend, therefore he shows kindness to his son Mephibosheth. God is faithful to us; let us not be unfaithful to one another. If Providence has raised us, and our friends and their families are brought low, we must look upon that as giving us the fairer opportunity of being kind to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Cherethites and the Pelethites - See the marginal reference note.<p>Chief rulers - The word &#1499;&#1492;&#1503;  ko&#770;he&#770;n, here rendered a "chief ruler," is the regular word for a priest.

David Sends for Mephibosheth.<p>1-7. David said, Is there yet any that is left of the house of Saul&#8212;On inquiry, Saul's land steward was found, who gave information that there still survived Mephibosheth, a son of Jonathan who was five years old at his father's death, and whom David, then wandering in exile, had never seen. His lameness (2Sa 4:4) had prevented him from taking any part in the public contests of the time. Besides, according to Oriental notions, the younger son of a crowned monarch has a preferable claim to the succession over the son of a mere heir-apparent; and hence his name was never heard of as the rival of his uncle Ish-bosheth. His insignificance had led to his being lost sight of, and it was only through Ziba that David learned of his existence, and the retired life he passed with one of the great families in trans-jordanic Canaan who remained attached to the fallen dynasty. Mephibosheth was invited to court, and a place at the royal table on public days was assigned him, as is still the custom with Eastern monarchs. Saul's family estate, which had fallen to David in right of his wife (Nu 27:8), or been forfeited to the crown by Ish-bosheth's rebellion (2Sa 12:8), was provided (2Sa 9:11; also 2Sa 19:28), for enabling Mephibosheth to maintain an establishment suitable to his rank, and Ziba appointed steward to manage it, on the condition of receiving one-half of the produce in remuneration for his labor and expense, while the other moiety was to be paid as rent to the owner of the land (2Sa 19:29).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/9.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A servant; </span> one who had been a servant, and, as it may seem, a steward to Saul. <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-10.htm" title="You therefore, and your sons, and your servants, shall till the land for him, and you shall bring in the fruits, that your master's son may have food to eat: but Mephibosheth your master's son shall eat bread always at my table.

It then became the title of the Phoenician sun god; and Jezebel's shameless worship of this deity, and her cruelty to Jehovah's prophets, made the people henceforth change the name Baal into Bosheth, "the shameful thing" (see note on 2 Samuel 2:8). Mephibosheth had not changed his name, but had lived in obscurity in the wild region beyond Mahanaim. Meanwhile Ziba had probably taken care of Saul's property in the tribe of Benjamin. There is no reason to doubt that he had been steward there for Saul, and after his master's death had continued in possession of the estate. David, we may feel sure, would not interfere with it, and Ziba would hold it for Saul's heirs, who could not themselves take possession. To him David now sends, not because he expected to hear of a son of his dear friend Jonathan, but because he was ready to show kindness to any representative of the fallen monarch. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/8.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And David made (himself) a name, when he returned from smiting (i.e., from the defeat of) Aram, (and smote Edom) in the valley of Salt, eighteen thousand men." The words enclosed in brackets are wanting in the Masoretic text as it has come down to us, and must have fallen out from a mistake of the copyist, whose eye strayed from &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; to &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501;; for though the text is not "utterly unintelligible" without these words, since the passage might be rendered "after he had smitten Aram in the valley of Salt eighteen thousand men," yet this would be decidedly incorrect, as the Aramaeans were not smitten in the valley of Salt, but partly at Medeba (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-7.htm">1 Chronicles 19:7</a>) and Helam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-17.htm">2 Samuel 10:17</a>), and partly in their own land, which was very far away from the Salt valley. Moreover, the difficulty presented by the text cannot be removed, as Movers supposes, by changing &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1512;&#1501; (Syria) into &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; (Edom), as the expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493; ("when he returned") would still be unexplained. The facts were probably these: Whilst David, or rather Israel, was entangled in the war with the Ammonites and Aramaeans, the Edomites seized upon the opportunity, which appeared to them a very favourable one, to invade the land of Israel, and advanced as far as the southern extremity of the Dead Sea. As soon, therefore, as the Aramaeans were defeated and subjugated, and the Israelitish army had returned from this war, David ordered it to march against the Edomites, and defeated them in the valley of Salt. This valley cannot have been any other than the Ghor adjoining the Salt mountain on the south of the Dead Sea, which really separates the ancient territories of Judah and Edom (Robinson, Pal. ii. 483). There Amaziah also smote the Edomites at a later period (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-7.htm">2 Kings 14:7</a>). We gather more concerning this war of David from the text of the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-12.htm">2 Samuel 8:12</a>) taken in connection with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15-16</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/60-2.htm">Psalm 60:2</a>. According to the Chronicles, it was Abishai the son of Zeruiah who smote the Edomites. This agrees very well not only with the account in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-10.htm">2 Samuel 10:10</a>., to the effect that Abishai commanded a company in the war with the Syrians and Ammonites under the generalship of his brother Joab, but also with the heading to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a>, in which it is stated that Joab returned after the defeat of Aram, and smote the Edomites in the valley of Salt, twelve thousand men; and with <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-15.htm">1 Kings 11:15-16</a>, in which we read that when David was in Edom, Joab, the captain of the host, came up to bury the slain, and smote every male in Edom, and remained six months in Edom with all Israel, till he had cut off every male in Edom. From this casual but yet elaborate notice, we learn that the war with the Edomites was a very obstinate one, and was not terminated all at once. The difference as to the number slain, which is stated to have been 18,000 in the text before us and in the Chronicles, and 12,000 in the heading to <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a>, may be explained in a very simple manner, on the supposition that the reckonings made were only approximative, and yielded different results;<p>(Note: Michaelis adduces a case in point from the Seven Years' War. After the battle of Lissa, eight or twelve thousand men were reported to have been taken prisoners; but when they were all counted, including those who fell into the hands of the conquerors on the second, third, and fourth days of the flight, the number amounted to 22,000.)<p>and the fact that David is named as the victor in the verse before us, Joab in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/60-1.htm">Psalm 60:1-12</a>, and Abishai in the Chronicles, admits of a very easy explanation after what has just been observed. The Chronicles contain the most literal account. Abishai smote the Edomites as commander of the men engaged, Joab as commander-in-chief of the whole army, and David as king and supreme governor, of whom the writer of the Chronicles affirms, "The Lord helped David in all his undertakings." After the defeat of the Edomites, David placed garrisons in the land, and made all Edom subject to himself. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm">2 Samuel 8:15-18</a>.
