Though Mephibosheth ate at the king's table, he would have a household to maintain - for he had a wife and son - and other expenses; and his having "food to eat" includes everything necessary, as does our prayer for "daily bread." He would live at Jerusalem as a nobleman and Ziba would cultivate his estates, paying, as is usual in the East, a fixed proportion of the value of the produce to his master. <span class="cmt_word">Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants</span> (slaves). He had evidently thriven; for, beginning as a slave in Saul's household, he had now several wives and many slaves of his own, and had become a person of considerable importance. He would still remain so, though somewhat shorn both of wealth and dignity in becoming only Mephibosheth's farmer. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David inquired whether there was any one left of the house of Saul to whom he could show favour for Jonathan's sake (&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1470;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;: is it so that there is any one?  equals  there is certainly some one left), a servant of Saul named Ziba was summoned, who told the king that there was a son of Jonathan living in the house of Machir at Lodebar, and that he was lame in his feet. &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1492;&#1488;&#1508;&#1505;, "is there no one at all besides?" The &#1500; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is a roundabout way of expressing the genitive, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, etc., and is obviously not to be altered into &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, as Thenius proposes. "The kindness of God" is love and kindness shown in God, and for God's sake (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-36.htm">Luke 6:36</a>). Machir the son of Ammiel was a rich man, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, who, after the death of Saul and Jonathan, had received the lame son of the latter into his house. Lodebar (&#1500;&#1493;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512;, written &#1500;&#1488;&#1491;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-27.htm">2 Samuel 17:27</a>, but erroneously divided by the Masoretes into two words in both passages) was a town on the east of Mahanaim, towards Rabbath Amman, probably the same place as Lidbir (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-26.htm">Joshua 13:26</a>); but it is not further known.</body></html>
