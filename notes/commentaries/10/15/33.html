David therefore, conceives the idea of employing him in endeavouring to defeat or render abortive the counsel of Ahithophel.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:31-37 David prays not against Ahithophel's person, but against his counsel. He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and in death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render ...

Comparing the prayer against Ahithophel with the counsel to Hushai, we see how strongly a spirit of fervent piety was combined in his character with the devices of an active and far-seeing policy.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Increasing my charge, and care, and sorrow for what may befall thee, and being but of little use to me: for it may seem he was an old man, and fitter for counsel than for war. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Unto whom David said,....

Consequently the word must be pointed thus, &#1492;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; (with the article), and rendered as a vocative, as it has been by Jerome and Luther. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, seer, is equivalent to prophet. He applies this epithet to Zadok, as the high priest who received divine revelations by means of the Urim. The meaning is, Thou Zadok art equal to a prophet; therefore thy proper place is in Jerusalem (O. v. Gerlach). Zadok was to stand as it were upon the watch there with Abiathar, and the sons of both to observe the events that occurred, and send him word through their sons into the plain of the Jordan. "Behold, I will tarry by the ferries of the desert, till a word comes from you to show me," sc., what has taken place, or how the things shape themselves in Jerusalem. Instead of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, the earlier translators as well as the Masoretes adopted the reading &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;, "in the steppes of the desert." The allusion in this case would be to the steppes of Jericho (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-5.htm">2 Kings 25:5</a>). But Bttcher has very properly defended the Chethib on the strength of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>, where the Keri has &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; again, though &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; is the true reading (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-19.htm">2 Samuel 19:19</a>). The "ferries of the desert" are the places where the Jordan could be crossed, the fords of the Jordan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-7.htm">Joshua 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a>).</body></html>
