He took this resolve, as a penitent submitting to the rod. Before unrighteous Absalom he could justify himself, and stand out; but before the righteous God he must condemn himself, and yield to his judgments. Thus he accepts the punishment of his sin. And good men, when they themselves suffer, are anxious that others should not be led to suffer with them. He compelled none; those whose hearts were with Absalom, to Absalom let them go, and so shall their doom be. Thus Christ enlists none but willing followers. David cannot bear to think that Ittai, a stranger and an exile, a proselyte and a new convert, who ought to be encouraged and made easy, should meet with hard usage. But such value has Ittai for David's wisdom and goodness, that he will not leave him. He is a friend indeed, who loves at all times, and will adhere to us in adversity. Let us cleave to the Son of David, with full purpose of heart, and neither life nor death shall separate us from his love.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahithophel - It has been with great probability supposed that Ahithophel was estranged from David by personal resentment for his conduct in the matter of Bath-sheba and Uriah (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-3.htm">2 Samuel 11:3</a>).<p>While he offered sacrifices - Rather, that Absalom sent for Ahithophel to be present when he offered the sacrifices; the intention being that all who partook of the sacrifice should be bound together to prosecute the enterprise. Absalom, too, would take advantage of the excitement of the great feast to inflame the ardour of the guests, and pledge them irrevocably to his cause. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/15.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 15:13-37.

Or, secondly, The people, whose temper is generally unstable, weary of old things, and desirous of changes, and apt to expect great benefits thereby. Or, thirdly, Absalom, whose noble birth, and singular beauty, and most obliging carriage, and ample promises, had won the people’s hearts; considering also that he was David’s first-born, to whom the kingdom of right belonged, and yet that David intended to give away his right to Solomon, which the people thought might prove the occasion of a civil and dreadful war, which hereby they designed to prevent. Or, fourthly, The just and holy God, who ordered and overruled all these things for David’s chastisement, and the instruction and terror of sinners in all future ages. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And there came a messenger to David,....

After the lapse of forty (?) years Absalom said to the king, "Pray I will go (i.e., pray allow me to go) and perform a vow in Hebron which I vowed to the Lord during my stay at Geshur" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-8.htm">2 Samuel 15:8</a>). The number forty is altogether unsuitable, as it cannot possibly be understood either as relating to the age of Absalom or to the year of David's reign: for Absalom was born at Hebron after David had begun to reign, and David only reigned forty years and a half in all, and Absalom's rebellion certainly did not take place in the last few weeks of his reign. It is quite as inappropriate to assume, as the terminus a quo of the forty years, either the commencement of Saul's reign, as several of the Rabbins have done, as well as the author of the marginal note in Cod. 380 of De Rossi (&#1513;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500; &#1500;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1493;&#1514;), or the anointing of David at Bethlehem, as Luther (in the marginal note) and Lightfoot do; for the word "after" evidently refers to some event in the life of Absalom, to which allusion has previously been made, namely, either to the time of his reconciliation with David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-33.htm">2 Samuel 14:33</a>), or (what is not so probable) to the period of his return from Geshur to Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-23.htm">2 Samuel 14:23</a>). Consequently the reading adopted by the Syriac, Arabic, and Vulgate, also by Theodoret and others, viz., "four years," must certainly be the correct one, and not "forty days," which we find in Codd. 70 and 96 in Kennicott, since forty days would be far too short a time for maturing the rebellion. It is true, that with the reading &#1488;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506; we should expect, as a rule, the plural &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;. At the same time, the numbers from two to ten are sometimes construed with a singular noun (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-1.htm">2 Kings 22:1</a>; cf. Gesenius, 120, 2). The pretended vow was, that if Jehovah would bring him back to Jerusalem, he would serve Jehovah. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1506;&#1489;&#1491;, "to do a service to Jehovah," can only mean to offer a sacrifice, which is the explanation given by Josephus. The Chethib &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489; is not the infinitive, but the imperfect Hiphil: si reduxerit, reduxerit me, which is employed in an unusual manner instead of the inf. absol., for the sake of emphasis. The Keri &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; would have to be taken as an adverb "again;" but this is quite unnecessary. </body></html>
