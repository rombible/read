It was impossible for the king to hear every case in detail; certain persons were therefore appointed to hear causes and report the facts to the king, who thereupon pronounced his judgment. Absalom uses the same arts which have been used by the demagogue in all ages. He does not accuse the king himself of wrong, but insinuates that the <span class= "ital">system </span>of government is detective, and expresses his own earnest wish to set things right.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-3.htm" title="And Absalom said to him, See, your matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear you.">2 Samuel 15:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Absalom said, See, thy matters are good and right — </span>Upon some very slight hearing of any man’s cause he approved of it, that he might oblige him; flattering all that they had right on their side, so that, if their causes should go against them, they might conclude, if Absalom had been judge, it would have been otherwise. <span class="ital">There is no man deputed of the king to hear thee — </span>None that will do thee justice. The other sons and relations of the king, and the rest of the judges and rulers under him and them, are wholly corrupt; or, at least, not careful and diligent as they should be, and my father, being grown in years, is negligent of public affairs. So Absalom said, or insinuated. And it is always the way of turbulent, aspiring men, to reproach the government they are under. Even David, we see, one of the best of kings, could not escape the worst of censures, and that even from his own son; for what could be worse than that which is here thrown out against him, that he neglected to administer true and impartial justice and judgment to his people? It is marvellous that David did not observe and nip this growing insurrection in its bud. But Delaney is of opinion that he was dangerously ill at this time, and that therefore Absalom seized this as a fit opportunity to take the steps here mentioned to increase his popularity, and draw the people after him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:1-6 David allows Absalom's pomp.

Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate&#8212;Public business in the East is always transacted early in the morning&#8212;the kings sitting an hour or more to hear causes or receive petitions, in a court held anciently, and in many places still, in the open air at the city gateway; so that, as those whose circumstances led them to wait on King David required to be in attendance on his morning levees, Absalom had to rise up early and stand beside the way of the gate. Through the growing infirmities of age, or the occupation of his government with foreign wars, many private causes had long lain undecided, and a deep feeling of discontent prevailed among the people. This dissatisfaction was artfully fomented by Absalom, who addressed himself to the various suitors; and after briefly hearing their tale, he gratified everyone with a favorable opinion of his case. Studiously concealing his ambitious designs, he expressed a wish to be invested with official power, only that he might accelerate the course of justice and advance the public interests. His professions had an air of extraordinary generosity and disinterestedness, which, together with his fawning arts in lavishing civilities on all, made him a popular favorite. Thus, by forcing a contrast between his own display of public spirit and the dilatory proceedings of the court, he created a growing disgust with his father's government, as weak, careless, or corrupt, and seduced the affections of the multitude, who neither penetrated the motive nor foresaw the tendency of his conduct.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thy matters are good and right:</span> upon some very slight hearing of their case he approved it, that he might oblige all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">No man deputed of the king to hear thee, </span> to wit, none such as will do thee justice.

After some further talk, and finding he had a suit at law to bring on, and either seeing it drawn up in writing, or hearing his account of it, at once declared, without hearing the other party: <p>see, thy matters are good and right; thy cause is a good cause, and if it could be heard by proper persons there is no doubt but things would go on thy side, and thou wouldest carry thy cause: <p>but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee; the king is grown old himself and his sons are negligent, and do not attend to business, and there are none besides them appointed to hear causes; and he suggested, as appears by what follows, that he was not in commission, but if he was, or should he appointed a judge, he would attend to business, and people should not go away after this manner, without having justice administered unto them, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/15.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Absalom said unto him, See, thy matters are good and right; but there is no man deputed of the king to hear thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/15.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">See, thy matters</span>, &c.] He artfully flatters each suitor by pronouncing a favourable decision on his case, condoles with him on the improbability of his obtaining a hearing, and hints how differently matters would be managed if he were in power.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">there is no man</span>, &c.] This and not the marginal alternative <span class="ital">none will hear thee from the king downward</span> is the correct rendering. There was no one appointed to investigate the evidence and lay it before the king. He implies that decisions were given hastily and arbitrarily, and that his father needed assessors to help him. There is no reason to suppose that David was neglecting his duty as a judge; but the task was growing too heavy for one man to perform it.

But as Joab would not come to him, even after he had sent for him twice, Absalom commanded his servants to set fire to one of Joab's fields which adjoined his own and was then full of barley, for the purpose of compelling him to come, as he foresaw that Joab would not take this destruction of his property quietly, but would come to him to complain. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1488;&#1500;, literally "at my hand," i.e., by the side of my field or property.
