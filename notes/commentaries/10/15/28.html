It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art not those a seer? - If the text be correct, the sense would be, "Art thou not a seer? therefore go back to the city, and observe, and certify me of what thou seest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>.

This conjecture is the substitution of <span class="accented">arboth</span> for <span class="accented">abroth</span>, and they have made the same alteration at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-16.htm">2 Samuel 17:16</a>. But the substitution is uncalled for and mischievous; for David would not halt indefinitely in the plain, the Arabah (of which Arboth is the plural), but would press on to the fords, where some delay must take place, and where the king's presence would be important in giving instructions for what was by no means an easy operation (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-18.htm">2 Samuel 19:18</a>). At the river, moreover, David could be assailed only in front, where his "mighties" would make a strong defence, while in the Arabah they might be surrounded; and, encumbered as they were with women, their line must be so extended as to be weakened. We find, too, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-28.htm">Judges 3:28</a> that the fords of the Jordan formed a good military position. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-22.htm">2 Samuel 17:22</a> it is expressly said that the fording of the river did not take place until Jonathan and Ahimaaz came with their reports; and their words there, in ver, 21, show that David was on the bank when they arrived, with his preparations so complete, that, in the next few hours, all his company were safely carried over to the other side. Ahimaaz was a famous runner (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>), and, if David was ready, the time gained by him upon any body of troops leaving Jerusalem at the same hour, would have enabled the king to get his people across; but if he had still some miles to march, with a number of women and children, Ahimaaz's fleetness would have been rendered useless. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>After this assurance of his devotedness, David let Ittai do as he pleased. &#1493;&#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1500;&#1498;, "go and pass on." &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; does not mean to pass by, but to go forward. Thus Ittai and his men and all his family that was with him went forward with the king. By "the little ones" (taph) we are to understand a man's whole family, as in many other instances (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-37.htm">Exodus 12:37</a>).<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-22.htm">2 Samuel 15:22-23</a><p>The king crosses the Kidron, and sends the priests back with the ark to Jerusalem. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-23.htm">2 Samuel 15:23</a>. All the land (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25</a>) wept aloud when all the people went forward; and the king went over the brook Kidron, and all the people went over in the direction of (lit. in the face of) the way to the desert. The brook Kidron is a winter torrent, i.e., a mountain torrent which only flows during the heavy rains of winter (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). It is on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives, and derives its name from the appearance of the water when rendered muddy through the melting of the snow (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>). In summer it is nothing more than a dry channel in the valley of Jehoshaphat (see Robinson, Pal. i. 396, and v. Raumer, Pal. p. 309, note 81). "The wilderness" (midbar) is the northern part of the desert of Judah, through which the road to Jericho and the Jordan lay.</body></html>
