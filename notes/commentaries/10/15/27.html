Nothing is said in any part of this narrative of Nathan and Gad, both of whom were certainly still living (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-11.htm" title="For when David was up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,">2Samuel 24:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/24-13.htm" title="So Gad came to David, and told him, and said to him, Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? or will you flee three months before your enemies, while they pursue you? or that there be three days' pestilence in your land? now advise, and see what answer I shall return to him that sent me.">2Samuel 24:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm" title="Why Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith does reign, and David our lord knows it not?">1Kings 1:11</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Your two sons with you.</span>—Zadok only has been mentioned, and probably Abiathar was not present at the moment, but David shows by this way of speaking that he means to address them both.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/15.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-27.htm" title="The king said also to Zadok the priest, Are not you a seer? return into the city in peace, and your two sons with you, Ahimaaz your son, and Jonathan the son of Abiathar.">2 Samuel 15:27</a></span>. <span class="ital">Art thou not a seer? Return into the city in peace </span>— “It should seem from hence,” says Delaney, “that Zadok was a prophet: however, as a priest, he was a teacher; and as such, bound to stay with his people in the greatest exigencies, and instruct them in their duty: besides that, by staying to do his duty to his people, he might also do good offices to his prince.” Indeed, the word <span class="greekheb">ראה</span>, <span class="ital">roeh, </span>here rendered <span class="ital">seer, </span>means also a <span class="ital">seeing, discerning </span>and <span class="ital">observing </span>man: an interpretation which suits well with the present state of David’s mind and affairs. As if he had said, Thou art a wise man, fit to make observations on what is passing in Jerusalem, and to give me information thereof. Accordingly David concerted a plan, both with Zadok and Abiathar, of corresponding with him, and sending him intelligence of all his enemies’ measures by their sons, Ahimaaz and Jonathan.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>15:24-30 David is very careful for the safety of the ark. It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art not those a seer? - If the text be correct, the sense would be, "Art thou not a seer? therefore go back to the city, and observe, and certify me of what thou seest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>.

Art not <span class="ital">thou a seer</span>] An obscure expression variously explained. (1) <span class="ital">Art thou a seer</span>? The high-priest is supposed to be called a <span class="ital">seer</span>, because he received divine revelations by means of the Urim and Thummim; but there is no trace of such a use of the term elsewhere. (2) <span class="ital">Dost thou see</span>? i.e. understand: an untenable rendering. (3) The Vulg. gives different vowels to the consonants, and renders, <span class="ital">O seer, return</span>, &c. (4) The Sept. reads, <span class="ital">See! thou shalt return</span>, which requires but a small change in the Heb. text, and is probably the best solution of the difficulty.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/15.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 27.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Art thou</span> (not) <span class="cmt_word">a seer?</span> Both the Authorized Version and the Revised Version evade the difficulty of this passage  by inserting the word "not." It is one of the merits of the Revised Version that usually it does not take these liberties. But "Art thou a seer?" is meaningless; and the attempts, moreover, to show that Zadok was a seer fail entirely in proof. The receiving revelations by Urim and Thummim was a priestly, and not a prophetic, function. Without altering the text, the words may be correctly translated, "Seest thou?" This was probably a colloquial phrase, of which the Septuagint gives the sense by rendering it in the imperative, "See;" while the Syriac, regarding it as an expletive, boldly omits it. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But Ittai replied with a solemn oath, "Assuredly at the place where my lord the king shall be (stay), whether for death or life, there will thy servant be." &#1488;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; means "only," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/40-14.htm">Genesis 40:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/42-8.htm">Job 42:8</a>; here, in a declaration on oath, it is equivalent to assuredly (vid., Ewald, 356, b.). The Chethib is therefore correct, and the erasure of &#1488;&#1501; in the Keri is a bad emendation.
