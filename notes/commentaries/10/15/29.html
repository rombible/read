It is right to be more concerned for the church's prosperity than our own; to prefer the success of the gospel above our own wealth, credit, ease, and safety. Observe with what satisfaction and submission David speaks of the Divine disposal. It is our interest, as well as our duty, cheerfully to acquiesce in the will of God, whatever befalls us. Let us see God's hand in all events; and that we may not be afraid of what shall be, let us see all events in God's hand. David's sin was ever before him, Ps 51:3; but never so plain, nor ever appearing so black as now. He never wept thus when Saul hunted him, but a wounded conscience makes troubles lie heavy, Ps 38:4.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Art not those a seer? - If the text be correct, the sense would be, "Art thou not a seer? therefore go back to the city, and observe, and certify me of what thou seest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-28.htm">2 Samuel 15:28</a>.

Zadok also, and all the Levites &#8230;, bearing the ark&#8212;Knowing the strong religious feelings of the aged king, they brought it to accompany him in his distress. But as he could not doubt that both the ark and their sacred office would exempt them from the attacks of the rebels, he sent them back with it&#8212;not only that they might not be exposed to the perils of uncertain wandering, for he seems to place more confidence in the symbol of the divine presence than in God Himself&#8212;but that, by remaining in Jerusalem, they might render him greater service by watching the enemy's movements.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Zadok therefore and Abiathar carried the ark of God again to Jerusalem,....

All the land (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-25.htm">1 Samuel 14:25</a>) wept aloud when all the people went forward; and the king went over the brook Kidron, and all the people went over in the direction of (lit. in the face of) the way to the desert. The brook Kidron is a winter torrent, i.e., a mountain torrent which only flows during the heavy rains of winter (&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#787;&#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x39a;&#x3b5;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/18-1.htm">John 18:1</a>). It is on the eastern side of Jerusalem, between the city and the Mount of Olives, and derives its name from the appearance of the water when rendered muddy through the melting of the snow (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/6-16.htm">Job 6:16</a>). In summer it is nothing more than a dry channel in the valley of Jehoshaphat (see Robinson, Pal. i. 396, and v. Raumer, Pal. p. 309, note 81). "The wilderness" (midbar) is the northern part of the desert of Judah, through which the road to Jericho and the Jordan lay.</body></html>
