He prayed this, in firm belief that God has all hearts in his hand, and tongues also. But we must second our prayers with endeavours, and David did so, else we tempt God. But we do not find wisdom and simplicity so united in any mere man, that we can perceive nothing which needs forgiveness. Yet, when the Son of David was treated with all possible treachery and cruelty, his wisdom, meekness, candour, and patience, were perfect. Him let us follow, cleave to, and serve, in life and in death.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/15.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Render ...

Comparing the prayer against Ahithophel with the counsel to Hushai, we see how strongly a spirit of fervent piety was combined in his character with the devices of an active and far-seeing policy.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/15.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/15.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So Hushai David's friend came into the city,....

Evidently he entered it on the day of David's flight (ch. 17:1), and Ahithophers proposal to select twelve thousand men from Absalom's followers shows how very powerful the conspiracy was. Had this advice been followed, the decisive battle would have been fought that evening at the fords of the Jordan, a few miles only from Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/15.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Ahithophel and Hushai. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-31.htm">2 Samuel 15:31</a>. When David was going by the height of the olive-trees, i.e., the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered, and barefooted, as a sign of grief and mourning (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/6-12.htm">Esther 6:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>), and with the people who accompanied him also mourning, he received intelligence that Ahithophel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-12.htm">2 Samuel 15:12</a>) was with Absalom, and among the conspirators. &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491; gives no sense; for David cannot be the subject, because the next clause, "and David said," etc., contains most distinctly an expression of David's on receiving some information. Thenius would therefore alter &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; into the Hophal &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;, whilst Ewald (131, a) would change it into &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, an unusual form of the Hophal, "David was informed," according to the construction of the Hiphil with the accusative. But although this construction of the Hiphil is placed beyond all doubt by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/31-37.htm">Job 31:37</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/26-4.htm">Job 26:4</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a>, the Hiphil is construed as a rule, as the Hophal always is, with &#1500; of the person who receives information. Consequently &#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1491; must be altered into &#1500;&#1491;&#1493;&#1491;, and &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; taken as impersonal, "they announced to David." Upon receipt of this intelligence David prayed to the Lord, that He would "turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness," make it appear as folly, i.e., frustrate it, - a prayer which God answered (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>.). </body></html>
