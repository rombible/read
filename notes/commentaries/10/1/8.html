During the period of the judges they had also repeatedly joined the foes of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-13.htm" title="And he gathered to him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.">Judges 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm" title="And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even they came up against them;">Judges 6:3</a>), but some years before this they had been terribly defeated by Saul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/15-4.htm" title="And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.">1Samuel 15:4-9</a>). and it is possible that the present messenger may either have attached himself to the army of the conqueror, or have been compelled, according to ancient custom, to serve in its ranks. One of their bands had also just received a severe blow at the hands of David, but of this last attack the Amalekite could not have known.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-10 The blow which opened David's way to the throne was given about the time he had been sorely distressed.

David's question, "How went the matter?" evinces the deep interest he took in the war, an interest that sprang from feelings of high and generous patriotism, not from views of ambition. The Amalekite, however, judging him to be actuated by a selfish principle, fabricated a story improbable and inconsistent, which he thought would procure him a reward. Having probably witnessed the suicidal act of Saul, he thought of turning it to his own account, and suffered the penalty of his grievously mistaken calculation (compare 2Sa 1:9 with 1Sa 31:4, 5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said unto me, who art thou?....

After the death of Saul, and David's return to Ziklag from his campaign against the Amalekites, there came a man to David on the third day, with his clothes torn and earth strewed upon his head (as a sign of deep mourning: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>), who informed him of the flight and overthrow of the Israelitish army, and the death of Saul and Jonathan.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1-3</a><p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a> may be regarded as the protasis to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2</a>, so far as the contents are concerned, although formally it is rounded off, and &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; forms the apodosis to &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1497;: "It came to pass after the death of Saul, David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-1.htm">1 Samuel 30:1-26</a>), that David remained at Ziklag two days. And it came to pass on the third day," etc. Both of these notices of the time refer to the day, on which David returned to Ziklag from the pursuit and defeat of the Amalekites. Whether the battle at Gilboa, in which Saul fell, occurred before or after the return of David, it is impossible to determine. All that follows from the juxtaposition of the two events in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-1.htm">2 Samuel 1:1</a>, is that they were nearly contemporaneous. The man "came from the army from with Saul," and therefore appears to have kept near to Saul during the battle.</body></html>
