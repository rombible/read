The man who brought the tidings, David put to death, as a murderer of his prince. David herein did not do unjustly; the Amalekite confessed the crime. If he did as he said, he deserved to die for treason; and his lying to David, if indeed it were a lie, proved, as sooner or later that sin will prove, lying against himself. Hereby David showed himself zealous for public justice, without regard to his own private interest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Amalekite was one of those who came "to strip the slain" on "the morrow" after the battle <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8</a>, and had the luck to find Saul and possess himself of his crown and bracelet.

Then I went to him, and slew him, because I knew that after his fall he would not live; and took the crown upon his head, and the bracelet upon his arm, and brought them to my lord" (David). "After his fall" does not mean "after he had fallen upon his sword or spear" (Clericus), for this is neither implied in &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493; nor in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; ("supported, i.e., leaning upon his spear"), nor are we at liberty to transfer it from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a> into this passage; but "after his defeat," i.e., so that he would not survive this calamity. This statement is at variance with the account of the death of Saul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>.; and even apart from this it has an air of improbability, or rather of untruth in it, particularly in the assertion that Saul was leaning upon his spear when the chariots and horsemen of the enemy came upon him, without having either an armour-bearer or any other Israelitish soldier by his side, so that he had to turn to an Amalekite who accidentally came by, and to ask him to inflict the fatal wound. The Amalekite invented this, in the hope of thereby obtaining the better recompense from David. The only part of his statement which is certainly true, is that he found the king lying dead upon the field of battle, and took off the crown and armlet; since he brought these to David. But it is by no means certain whether he was present when Saul expired, or merely found him after he was dead.</body></html>
