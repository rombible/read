David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship.

Abarbinel interprets these words thus, that he, who was the shield of the mighty, even Saul himself, was vilely cast away, or become loathsome; and that his shield was anointed, not with oil, but with the blood of the slain, and the fat of the mighty, connecting them with the words following. <p>(t) Cippi Heb. p. 34.

Nature is as it were summoned to share in the mourning. The scene of such a terrible disaster should be unvisited by fertilizing dew and rain, and lie smitten with eternal barrenness. For the thought that nature can sympathize with man compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; In the day when he went down to the grave I caused a mourning: I covered the deep for him, and I restrained the floods thereof, and the great waters were stayed: and I caused Lebanon to mourn for him, and all the trees of the field fainted for him.">Ezekiel 31:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nor fields of offerings</span>] An expansion of the preceding thought. Gilboa should no longer possess fruitful fields, to produce tithes and offerings for Jehovah. The greatest curse which can befall it is to be cut off from rendering service to Jehovah. Compare the description of extreme famine in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm" title="The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.">Joel 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is vilely cast away</span>] This rendering seems to be an attempt to combine two possible meanings of the Heb. word, <span class="ital">(a) was cast away, (b) was defiled</span> with blood and dust, of which the latter is probably right.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>as though he had <span class="ital">not</span> been <span class="ital">anointed with oil</span>] The original, which might be rendered exactly <span class="bld">the shield of Saul unanointed with oil</span>, leaves it uncertain whether the epithet <span class="ital">anointed</span> belongs to the shield or to Saul. (<span class="ital">a</span>) Most commentators understand it to refer to the shield, left upon the battle-field, uncared for, uncleansed from the stains of the combat. Shields made of metal were oiled to polish them; those made of wood and leather, to preserve them, and make missiles glide off easily. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm" title="Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise, you princes, and anoint the shield.">Isaiah 21:5</a>; and Verg. <span class="ital">Aen.</span> VII. 626:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“Pars leves clypeos et spicula lucida tergunt<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Arvina pingui.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>“With unctuous lard their shields they clean,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And make their javelins bright and sheen.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(<span class="ital">b</span>) On the other hand this term <span class="ital">anointed</span> is everywhere else applied to persons—in the books of Samuel always to the King—and not to things, and it is certainly grammatically possible to connect it with Saul, as is done by the E. V. The sense thus gained is much more forcible. ‘There the shield of mighty heroes was defiled—yea even the shield of Saul, whose consecrated person shared the common fate as though he had never been set apart as the Anointed of Jehovah.’<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 21.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Fields of offerings;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">fields of terumoth.</span> The terumoth were heave offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-14.htm">Leviticus 7:14, 32</a>), and the Vulgate, regarding these as thank offerings, translates, "Fields of firstfruits." The sense would thus be, "Fields of corn such as was used for heave offerings." Still, this gives us no suitable meaning; for Gilboa was not a place fit for the growth of corn; and Theodoret, in his version, has preserved a different reading, which is probably right, namely, "Ye fields and mountains of death." <span class="cmt_word">The shield...is vilely east away.</span> This rendering contains a classical idea derived from the Greeks and Romans, among whom it was a disgrace for a soldier to return without his shield. But this imputes personal cowardice to Saul - a reproach which is entirely undeserved; for he did not east away his shield, but remained steadfast unto death. The right translation is, "For there the shield of heroes, yea, the shield of Saul, was defiled," stained, that is, with blood. We have no proof whatsoever that the Israelites had the same notion as the Greeks, and if they had, David would certainly not have put such a stigma upon the fallen king. [As though he had] not [been] <span class="cmt_word">anointed with oil.</span> By rejecting the inserted words, we get the original, with all its simplicity, but with all its difficulty.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"There the shield of the heroes was defiled:<br />The shield of Saul not anointed with oil."</span> The interpretation put upon these words in the Authorized Version is taken from the Vulgate, no mean authority, but it is one which cannot be reconciled with the Hebrew, where it is not Saul, but his shield, which is referred to. It was a Jewish custom to anoint the shield with oil before a battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-5.htm">Isaiah 21:5</a>), in order probably to make the missiles of the enemy glance off from it without injury. And bearing this in mind, David now contrasts the sad issue of the battle with the hopes with which the warrior had in old times gone forth to war. Then his shield glistened brightly; now it was defiled with blood. In the Revised Version the rendering, "vilely cast away," is retained, the Revisers not having perceived that "defiled," which they have placed in the margin, is absolutely required for the text by the contrast with "the shield not anointed with oil." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David then reproached him for what he had done: "How wast thou not afraid to stretch forth thine hand to destroy the Lord's anointed?" and commanded one of his attendants to slay him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-15.htm">2 Samuel 1:15</a>.), passing sentence of death in these words: "Thy blood come upon thy head (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/2-1.htm">Joshua 2:1</a>;(1); for thy mouth hath testified against thee, saying, I have slain the Lord's anointed."<p>(Note: "Thy mouth hath testified against thee, and out of it thou art judged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-22.htm">Luke 19:22</a>), whether thou hast done it or not. If thou hast done it, thou receivest the just reward of thy deeds. If thou hast not done it, then throw the blame upon thine own lying testimony, and be content with the wages of a wicked flatterer; for, according to thine own confession, thou art the murderer of a king, and that is quite enough to betray thine evil heart. David could see plainly enough that the man was no murderer: he would show by his example that flatterers who boast of such sins as these should get no hearing from their superiors." - Berleb. Bible.)<p>David regarded the statement of the Amalekite as a sufficient ground for condemnation, without investigating the truth any further; though it was most probably untrue, as he could see through his design of securing a great reward as due to him for performing such a deed (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-10.htm">2 Samuel 4:10</a>), and looked upon a man who could attribute such an act to himself from mere avarice as perfectly capable of committing it. Moreover, the king's jewels, which he had brought, furnished a practical proof that Saul had really been put to death. This punishment was by no means so severe as to render it necessary to "estimate its morality according to the times," or to defend it merely from the standpoint of political prudence, on the ground that as David was the successor of Saul, and had been pursued by him as his rival with constant suspicion and hatred, he ought not to leave the murder of the king unpunished, if only because the people, or at any rate his own opponents among the people, would accuse him of complicity in the murder of the king, if not of actually instigating the murderer. David would never have allowed such considerations as these to lead him into unjust severity. And his conduct requires no such half vindication. Even on the supposition that Saul had asked the Amalekite to give him his death-thrust, as he said he had, it was a crime deserving of punishment to fulfil this request, the more especially as nothing is said about any such mortal wounding of Saul as rendered his escape or recovery impossible, so that it could be said that it would have been cruel under such circumstances to refuse his request to be put to death. If Saul's life was still "full in him," as the Amalekite stated, his position was not so desperate as to render it inevitable that he should fall into the hands of the Philistines. Moreover, the supposition was a very natural one, that he had slain the king for the sake of a reward. But slaying the king, the anointed of the Lord, was in itself a crime that deserved to be punished with death. What David might more than once have done, but had refrained from doing from holy reverence for the sanctified person of the king, this foreigner, a man belonging to the nation of the Amalekites, Israel's greatest foes, had actually done for the sake of gain, or at any rate pretended to have done. Such a crime must be punished with death, and that by David who had been chosen by God and anointed as Saul's successor, and whom the Amalekite himself acknowledge in that capacity, since otherwise he would not have brought him the news together with the royal diadem. </body></html>
