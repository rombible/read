The man who brought the tidings, David put to death, as a murderer of his prince. David herein did not do unjustly; the Amalekite confessed the crime. If he did as he said, he deserved to die for treason; and his lying to David, if indeed it were a lie, proved, as sooner or later that sin will prove, lying against himself. Hereby David showed himself zealous for public justice, without regard to his own private interest.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whether David believed the Amalekite's story, or not, his anger was equally excited, and the fact that the young man was an Amalekite, was not calculated to calm or check it. That David's temper was hasty, we know from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-13.htm">1 Samuel 25:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-32.htm">1 Samuel 25:32-34</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13-15. David said unto the young man &#8230; Whence art thou?&#8212;The man had at the outset stated who he was. But the question was now formally and judicially put. The punishment inflicted on the Amalekite may seem too severe, but the respect paid to kings in the West must not be regarded as the standard for that which the East may think due to royal station. David's reverence for Saul, as the Lord's anointed, was in his mind a principle on which he had faithfully acted on several occasions of great temptation. In present circumstances it was especially important that his principle should be publicly known; and to free himself from the imputation of being in any way accessory to the execrable crime of regicide was the part of a righteous judge, no less than of a good politician.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Whence art thou?</span> David heard and knew before what he was, but he asked it again judicially, in order to his trial and punishment. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David said unto the young man that told him, whence art thou?....

Then I went to him, and slew him, because I knew that after his fall he would not live; and took the crown upon his head, and the bracelet upon his arm, and brought them to my lord" (David). "After his fall" does not mean "after he had fallen upon his sword or spear" (Clericus), for this is neither implied in &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1493; nor in &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;&#1493; &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1503; ("supported, i.e., leaning upon his spear"), nor are we at liberty to transfer it from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-4.htm">1 Samuel 31:4</a> into this passage; but "after his defeat," i.e., so that he would not survive this calamity. This statement is at variance with the account of the death of Saul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-3.htm">1 Samuel 31:3</a>.; and even apart from this it has an air of improbability, or rather of untruth in it, particularly in the assertion that Saul was leaning upon his spear when the chariots and horsemen of the enemy came upon him, without having either an armour-bearer or any other Israelitish soldier by his side, so that he had to turn to an Amalekite who accidentally came by, and to ask him to inflict the fatal wound. The Amalekite invented this, in the hope of thereby obtaining the better recompense from David. The only part of his statement which is certainly true, is that he found the king lying dead upon the field of battle, and took off the crown and armlet; since he brought these to David. But it is by no means certain whether he was present when Saul expired, or merely found him after he was dead.</body></html>
