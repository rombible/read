It also applies truthfully to them both in their relations to each other.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-23.htm" title="Saul and Jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in their death they were not divided: they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.">2 Samuel 1:23</a></span>. <span class="ital">Saul and Jonathan were lovely — </span>Hebrew, <span class="greekheb">הנאהבים</span>, <span class="ital">hanneehabim, were loved, </span>namely, by each other, and by the people. <span class="ital">And pleasant in their lives — </span>Amiable and obliging in their carriage and conversation, both toward one another and toward others: for, as for Saul’s fierce behaviour toward Jonathan, it was only a sudden passion, by which his ordinary temper was not to be measured; and as for his carriage toward David, it proceeded from that jealousy, and those reasons of state, which too often engage even well-natured princes in similar hostilities. <span class="ital">And in their death they were not divided — </span>They were united in life and death; in life by the same common affection; in death by the same common fate. This is just what David intends to express. He does not, by any means, appear to design a commendation of their lives in any other respect. Nor does he speak, a word of Saul’s piety; he only commends him for those qualities which he really possessed; a fit pattern for all preachers in their funeral commendations. Dr. Lowth has beautifully expressed David’s meaning: —<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld"><span class="ital">“Nobile par, quos junxit, amor, quos gloria junxit, Una nunc fato jungit acerba dies.”</span></span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>We will not attempt to give our readers a translation of this elegant couplet, but we will present them below with a paraphrase not inferior, perhaps, in elegance or spirit, on this and two or three of the other stanzas of this elegy, from a poetical version of it by Thomas Roberts, Esq., late of Bristol, with which he has kindly favoured us, and in which both the beauty and force of the original seem to be well imitated. We wish the narrow limits of our work would admit of our inserting the whole.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">They were swifter than eagles — </span>In pursuing their enemies, and executing their designs: which is a great commendation in a prince, and a requisite quality in a warrior. <span class="ital">They were stronger than lions — </span>Or, rather, more courageous than lions. According to Agur’s observation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-30.htm" title="A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turns not away for any;">Proverbs 30:30</a>, the lion never betakes himself to flight, but faces his foe to the last. Courage then seems the most remarkable property of the lion. And since David uses the same word here in speaking of Saul and Jonathan which Agur uses in speaking of this property of the lion, he evidently means to celebrate the courage of his heroes rather than their strength; and to say that, in facing the enemy and braving of danger, they were undaunted as lions.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:17-27 Kasheth, or the bow, probably was the title of this mournful, funeral song. David does not commend Saul for what he was not; and says nothing of his piety or goodness. Jonathan was a dutiful son, Saul an affectionate father, therefore dear to each other. David had reason to say, that Jonathan's love to him was wonderful. Next to the love between Christ and his people, that affection which springs form it, produces the strongest friendship. The trouble of the Lord's people, and triumphs of his enemies, will always grieve true believers, whatever advantages they may obtain by them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let there be no dew ... - For a similar passionate form of poetical malediction, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/3-3.htm">Job 3:3-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/20-14.htm">Jeremiah 20:14-18</a>.<p>Nor fields of offerings - He imprecates such complete barrenness on the soil of Gilboa, that not even enough may grow for an offering of first-fruits.

Yet, on that fatal battle of Gilboa, many of the Jewish soldiers, who had displayed unflinching valor in former battles, forgetful of their own reputation and their country's honor, threw away their shields and fled from the field. This dishonorable and cowardly conduct is alluded to with exquisitely touching pathos.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Pleasant; </span> amiable and obliging in their carriage and conversation, both towards one another, and towards their people; for as for Saul’s fierce behaviour towards Jonathan, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-30.htm" title="Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, You son of the perverse rebellious woman, do not I know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own confusion, and to the confusion of your mother's nakedness?">1 Samuel 20:30</a>,33</span>, it was only a sudden passion, by which his ordinary temper was not to be measured; and for his carriage towards David, that was from that jealousy and reason of state which usually engageth even good-natured and well-nurtured princes to the same hostilities in like cases.

It is one of the finest odes of the Old Testament; full of lofty sentiment, and springing from deep and sanctified emotion, in which, without the slightest allusion to his own relation to the fallen king, David celebrates without envy the bravery and virtues of Saul and his son Jonathan, and bitterly laments their loss. "He said to teach," i.e., he commanded the children of Judah to practise or learn it. &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;, bow; i.e., a song to which the title Kesheth or bow was given, not only because the bow is referred to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-22.htm">2 Samuel 1:22</a>), but because it is a martial ode, and the bow was one of the principal weapons used by the warriors of that age, and one in the use of which the Benjaminites, the tribe-mates of Saul, were particularly skilful: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-40.htm">1 Chronicles 8:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-2.htm">1 Chronicles 12:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/14-7.htm">2 Chronicles 14:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/17-17.htm">2 Chronicles 17:17</a>. Other explanations are by no means so natural; such, for example, as that it related to the melody to which the ode was sung; whilst some are founded upon false renderings, or arbitrary alterations of the text, e.g., that of Ewald (Gesch. i. p. 41), Thenius, etc. This elegy was inserted in "the book of the righteous" (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-13.htm">Joshua 10:13</a>), from which the author of the books of Samuel has taken it. </body></html>
