They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

It is no “gross anthropomorphism,” for the Psalmist did not intend that the mind’s eye should clothe his figure in a concrete form. His aim is vividly to express the manifestation of the wrath of God, and he does so in figures which are intended to remain as purely mental conceptions, not to be realised as though God appeared in any visible shape. See some excellent remarks in Archbishop Trench’s <span class="ital">Comm. on the Epistles to the Seven Churches</span>, p. 43.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a smoke</span>] The outward sign of the pent-up fires of wrath. So anger is said <span class="ital">to smoke</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-1.htm" title="O God, why have you cast us off for ever? why does your anger smoke against the sheep of your pasture?">Psalm 74:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-4.htm" title="O LORD God of hosts, how long will you be angry against the prayer of your people?">Psalm 80:4</a> <span class="ital">marg.</span>). This bold figure is suggested by the panting and snorting of an angry animal. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/41-20.htm" title="Out of his nostrils goes smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.">Job 41:20</a>; in illustration of which Mr Cox quotes from Bertram’s <span class="ital">Travels in Carolina</span>: “I perceived a crocodile rush from a small lake … Thick smoke came with a thundering noise from his nostrils.” Martial speaks of <span class="ital">fumantem nasum ursi</span> “the smoking nostril of an angry bear” (<span class="ital">Epigr.</span> vi. 64. 28).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fire</span>] Compare again Job’s description of Leviathan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/41-19.htm" title="Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out....">Job 41:19-21</a>). Fire is the constant emblem of the consuming wrath of God. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm" title="For a fire is kindled in my anger, and shall burn to the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-3.htm" title="A fire goes before him, and burns up his enemies round about.">Psalm 97:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-29.htm" title="For our God is a consuming fire.">Hebrews 12:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">coals</span>] The fiery messengers of vengeance.

He designates God "the God" and "The Rock" (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a>) of Israel, to indicate that the contents of his prophecy relate to the salvation of the people of Israel, and are guaranteed by the unchangeableness of God. The saying which follows bears the impress of a divine oracle even in its enigmatical brevity. The verbs are wanting in the different sentences of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-4.htm">2 Samuel 23:4</a>. "A ruler over men," sc., "will arise," or there will be. &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; does not mean "among men," but "over men;" for &#1489;&#1468; is to be taken as with the verb &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, as denoting the object ruled over (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a>, etc.). &#1492;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501; does not mean certain men, but the human race, humanity. This ruler is "just" in the fullest sense of the word, as in the passages founded upon this, viz., <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-5.htm">Jeremiah 23:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-9.htm">Zechariah 9:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-2.htm">Psalm 72:2</a>. The justice of the ruler is founded in his "fear of God." &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; &#1497;&#1512;&#1488;&#1514; is governed freely by &#1502;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;. (On the fact itself, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-2.htm">Isaiah 11:2-3</a>.) The meaning is, "A ruler over the human race will arise, a just ruler, and will exercise his dominion in the spirit of the fear of God." </body></html>
