They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For thou art my lamp, O Lord: and the Lord will lighten my darkness.

God’s faithfulness attested by the Psalmist’s experience<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>After celebrating God’s goodness in delivering him from all the dangers which threatened his life, David goes on to describe how God had made him victorious over all his enemies.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 29-31.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">"For thou, Jehovah, art my Lamp;<br />And Jehovah will make my darkness light.<br />For by thee do I run upon a troop;<br />In my God I leap over a wall.<br />God - his way is perfect;<br />The word of Jehovah is purified.<br />He is a Shield to all that trust in him."</span> <span class="cmt_word">Lamp</span>. The lamp burning in the house is the proof of life and activity present there; and thus the extinguishing of the lamp means ruin and desolation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-17.htm">Job 21:17</a>). So David is called "the lamp of Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm">2 Samuel 21:17</a>), because the active life of the nation centred in him. In a still higher sense the life and being of his people centres in God, and without him the soul is waste and void, like the universe before God said, "Let there be light." <span class="cmt_word">I run.</span> To the warrior in old time speed was as important as strength, and thus Homer constantly calls Achilles "fleet of foot." It was his fleetness which gave Asahel a high place among the mighties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18</a>), and to this quality David now refers. The <span class="cmt_word">troop</span> signifies a light armed band of marauders, whom with God's aid David could overtake, and stop in their course of rapine. The <span class="cmt_word">wall</span> means fortifications like those of Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>). Sieges were tedious affairs in old time, but David had captured that city with a rapidity so great that the metaphor in the text is most appropriate. <span class="cmt_word">Purified</span>; or, <span class="accented">refined.</span> This does not mean that it is proved by experience and found true, but that it is absolutely good and perfect like refined gold (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/12-6.htm">Psalm 12:6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>21  Jehovah rendered to me according to my righteousness,<p>According to the cleanness of my hands He recompensed me.<p>22  For I have observed the ways of Jehovah,<p>And have not wickedly departed from my God.<p>23  For all His rights are before my eyes;<p>And His statutes,-I do not depart from them.<p>24  And I was innocent towards Him,<p>And kept myself from mine iniquity.<p>&#1490;&#1468;&#1502;&#1500; signifies to do to a person good or evil, like the Greek &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#834; and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;. The righteousness and cleanness of hands, i.e., the innocence, which David attributed to himself, were not perfect righteousness or holiness before God, but the righteousness of his endeavours and deeds as contrasted with the unrighteousness and wickedness of his adversaries and pursuers, and consisted in the fact that he endeavoured earnestly and sincerely to walk in the ways of God and to keep the divine commandments. &#1502;&#1503; &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to be wicked from, is a pregnant expression, signifying to depart wickedly from God. &#1500;&#1504;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;, i.e., as a standard before my eye. In the psalm we find &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, innocent in intercourse with the Lord, instead of &#1500;&#1493; &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-13.htm">Deuteronomy 18:13</a>); and for the fact itself, David's own testimony in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-23.htm">1 Samuel 26:23-24</a>, the testimony of God concerning him in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-8.htm">1 Kings 14:8</a>, and the testimony of history in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-5.htm">1 Kings 15:5</a>. &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, from mine iniquity, i.e., from the iniquity which I might have committed. </body></html>
