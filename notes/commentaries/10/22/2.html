They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer.

The imagery, by which David describes so emphatically all that Jehovah had been to him as a Deliverer from his enemies, is derived from the experiences of his warlike life, and particularly of his flight from Saul. The <span class="bld">cliff</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-25.htm" title="Saul also and his men went to seek him. And they told David; why he came down into a rock, and stayed in the wilderness of Maon. And when Saul heard that, he pursued after David in the wilderness of Maon.">1 Samuel 23:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-28.htm" title="Why Saul returned from pursuing after David, and went against the Philistines: therefore they called that place Selahammahlekoth.">1 Samuel 23:28</a>) where he had escaped from Saul, the <span class="bld">strong-hold</span> in the wilderness of Judah or the fastnesses of Engedi (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-14.htm" title="And David stayed in the wilderness in strong holds, and remained in a mountain in the wilderness of Ziph. And Saul sought him every day, but God delivered him not into his hand.">1 Samuel 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-19.htm" title="Then came up the Ziphites to Saul to Gibeah, saying, Does not David hide himself with us in strong holds in the wood, in the hill of Hachilah, which is on the south of Jeshimon?">1 Samuel 23:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/23-29.htm" title="And David went up from there, and dwelled in strong holds at Engedi.">1 Samuel 23:29</a>), “the rocks of the wild goats” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/24-2.htm" title="Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men on the rocks of the wild goats.">1 Samuel 24:2</a>), were all emblems of Him who had been throughout his true Refuge and Deliverer.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/22.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 2-4.</span> - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="accented">Jehovah is my Cliff and my Stronghold and my Deliverer:<br />The God of my rock, in whom I take refuge;<br />My Shield and the Horn of my salvation,<br />My Fastness and my Place of refuge:<br />My Saviour: thou savest me from violence.<br />I call upon Jehovah, the praised One,<br />And I am saved from my enemies."</span> The Syriac in ver. 2 inserts, "Fervently do I love thee, Jehovah my Strength;" but it probably only borrows the words from <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-1.htm">Psalm 18:1</a>. For we may well believe that it was at a later period of his life, after deeper and more heart searching trials, that David thus felt his love to Jehovah only strengthened and made more necessary to him by the loss of his earthly happiness. In ver. 3, <span class="cmt_word">The God of my rock</span> is changed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a> into "My God my Rock" (Authorized Version, "strength") - probably an intentional alteration, as being far less rugged and startling than this bold metaphor of the Deity being his rock's God. In the original the words present each its distinct idea. Thus in ver. 2 the <span class="accented">rock</span> is a high cliff or precipice. It is the word <span class="accented">sela</span>, which gave its name to the crag city of Idumea. <span class="cmt_word">Fortress</span> really means a rock, difficult of access, and forming a secure retreat. It is entirely a natural formation, and not a building. In ver. 3 <span class="accented">rock</span> is a vast mountainous mass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/18-4.htm">Job 18:4</a>), and, as it suggests the ideas of grandeur and immovable might, it is often used for God's glory as being the Strength and Protection of his people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15, 31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-29.htm">Isaiah 30:29</a>, margin). Next follow two ordinary metaphors, the <span class="accented">shield</span> for defence, and the horn for attack; after which David, who had so often sought safety among the cliffs and fastnesses of the mountains, returns to the same circle of thoughts, and calls God his <span class="cmt_word">High Tower,</span> the word signifying, not a building, but a height, a lofty natural stronghold; and finally <span class="accented">his Refuge</span>, a place of safe retreat among the mountains. This and the rest of the verse are omitted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-2.htm">Psalm 18:2</a>. In ver. 4 the words are as literally translated above, and signify, "Whenever call, I am saved." In all times of difficulty, prayer brings immediate deliverance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>). In a second war, Sibbechai and Hushathite slew Saph the Rephaite at Gob. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-11.htm">1 Chronicles 27:11</a>, Sibbechai, one of the gibborim of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-29.htm">1 Chronicles 11:29</a>), was the leader of the eighth division of the army (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-27.htm">2 Samuel 23:27</a>). &#1492;&#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497; is a patronymic from &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/4-4.htm">1 Chronicles 4:4</a>. The scene of conflict is called Gob in our text, and Gezer in the Chronicles. As Gob is entirely unknown. Thenius supposes it to be a slip of the pen for Gezer; but this is improbable, for the simple reason that Gob occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-19.htm">2 Samuel 21:19</a>. It may possibly have been a small place somewhere near to Gezer, which some suppose to have stood on the site of el Kubab, on the road from Ramleh to Yalo (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/10-33.htm">Joshua 10:33</a>). The name Saph is written Sippai in the Chronicles.</body></html>
