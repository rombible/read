They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>God is my strength and power: and he maketh my way perfect.

The vav cons. in &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; expresses the logical consequence. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497; is used instead of &#1497;&#1491;&#1497; &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-21.htm">2 Samuel 22:21</a>, which is repeated in the psalm simply for the sake of variation. The truth that God treats every man in accordance with his conduct towards Him, is expounded in four parallel clauses, in which the conduct of God is expressed in verbs in the Hithpael, formed from the adjectives used to describe the conduct of men towards God. To the &#1495;&#1505;&#1497;&#1491;, the pious or devoted to God, He also shows himself pious; and innocent, blameless, to the &#1514;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, the man strong in innocence, who walks in perfect innocence. &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;, a Niphal participle, from &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, he who keeps himself pure, strives after purity of walk. &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;, an anomalous contraction of &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512; (Ps.), analogous to the formation of &#1504;&#1489;&#1512; for &#1504;&#1489;&#1512;&#1512;. The form &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1500;, to show one's self perverse of crooked, is still more anomalous. God shows himself so towards the perverse, by giving him up to his perverseness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-28.htm">Romans 1:28</a>). This general truth is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-28.htm">2 Samuel 22:28</a> to the congregation of God, in the contrast which it presents of humble and haughty, and is expounded from the conduct of God, as displayed in the history of Israel, towards these two classes of men, into which the nation was divided. In the psalm, therefore, we find &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, for which the simple &#1493; is substituted here, because the verse does not contain any actual reason for what goes before. &#1506;&#1504;&#1497; &#1506;&#1501;, afflicted people, is used to denote the pious and depressed in the nation; &#1512;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, the high, i.e., the haughty, or godless rich and mighty in the nation. &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; is to be taken as a relative: whom Thou humblest (see Ewald, 332, b.; and for the thought, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-11.htm">Isaiah 2:11</a>). In the psalm the unusual mode of expression in the second clause is changed into the more common phrase, "Thou bringest down high, i.e., proud looks" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/6-17.htm">Proverbs 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-4.htm">Proverbs 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-13.htm">Proverbs 30:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/131-1.htm">Psalm 131:1</a>, etc.). </body></html>
