They that trust God in the way of duty, shall find him a present help in their greatest dangers: David did so. Remarkable preservations should be particularly mentioned in our praises. We shall never be delivered from all enemies till we get to heaven. God will preserve all his people, 2Ti 4:18. Those who receive signal mercies from God, ought to give him the glory. In the day that God delivered David, he sang this song. While the mercy is fresh, and we are most affected with it, let the thank-offering be brought, to be kindled with the fire of that affection. All his joys and hopes close, as all our hopes should do, in the great Redeemer.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>. For a commentary on the separate verses the reader is referred to the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>. <p>The last words of David - i. e., his last Psalm, his last "words of song" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-1.htm">2 Samuel 22:1</a>. The insertion of this Psalm, which is not in the Book of Psalms, was probably suggested by the insertion of the long Psalm in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22.htm">2 Samuel 22</a>.<p>David the son of Jesse said ... - The original word for "said" is used between 200 and 300 times in the phrase, "saith the Lord," designating the word of God in the mouth of the prophet. It is only applied to the words of a man here, and in the strikingly similar passage <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3-4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15-16</a>, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-1.htm">Proverbs 30:1</a>; and in all these places the words spoken are inspired words. The description of David is divided into four clauses, which correspond to and balance each other. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 22<p>2Sa 22:1-51. David's Psalm of Thanksgiving for God's Powerful Deliverance and Manifold Blessings.<p>The song contained in this chapter is the same as the eighteenth Psalm, where the full commentary will be given [see on [278]Ps 18:1, &c.]. It may be sufficient simply to remark that Jewish writers have noticed a great number of very minute variations in the language of the song as recorded here, from that embodied in the Book of Psalms&#8212;which may be accounted for by the fact that this, the first copy of the poem, was carefully revised and altered by David afterwards, when it was set to the music of the tabernacle. This inspired ode was manifestly the effusion of a mind glowing with the highest fervor of piety and gratitude, and it is full of the noblest imagery that is to be found within the range even of sacred poetry. It is David's grand tribute of thanksgiving for deliverance from his numerous and powerful enemies, and establishing him in the power and glory of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy gentleness hath made me great.
