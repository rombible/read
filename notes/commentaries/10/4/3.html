The Beerothites here appear as of the tribe of Benjamin, and it is probable that they fled from the incursions of the Philistines, and that Gittaim is the place mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-35.htm" title="Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.">Nehemiah 11:35</a> as occupied by the Benjamites returning from Babylon. The expression “until this day” makes it likely that the time of the writer was not very far removed from the events which he relates.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-3.htm" title="And the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and were sojourners there until this day.)">2 Samuel 4:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">The Beerothites fled to Gittaim — </span>When Saul was slain, several Israelites left their cities and fled, and the Philistines took possession of them.

When those difficulties dispirit us, which should sharpen our endeavours, we betray both our heavenly crowns and our earthly lives. Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty and ruin. The idle soul is an easy prey to the destroyer. We know not when and where death will meet us. When we lie down to sleep, we are not sure that we may not sleep the sleep of death before we awake; nor do we know from what hand the death-blow may come.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Beeroth - See the marginal reference. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9-17.htm">Joshua 9:17</a>, it might have been expected that the population of Beeroth would be Canaanite. But from some unknown cause the Canaanite inhabitants of Beeroth had fled to Gittaim - perhaps the same as Gath - and continued there as sojourners. If this flight of the Beerothites took place at the time of Saul's cruel attack upon the Gibeonites <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm">2 Samuel 21:1-2</a>, Baanah and Reehab may have been native Beerothites, and have been instigated to murder the son of Saul by a desire to avenge the blood of their countrymen. The fact of their being reckoned as Benjamites is quite compatible with their being Canaanites by blood. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>2Sa 4:1, 2.

The name is the dual form of Gath, meaning “two wine-presses,” which suggests that it may possibly have been in Philistia.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/4.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Gittaim</span>. This word is a dual, and means "the two Gaths;" the one being, probably, the acropolis, or upper town, at the foot of which nestled a new Gath, protected by the ancient stronghold. It is mentioned as belonging to Benjamin in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/11-33.htm">Nehemiah 11:33</a>; but could not have been an Israelite town at this time, as the Beerothites are described as <span class="accented">sojourners</span>, that is, dwellers in a foreign country. When expelled from Beeroth, they probably seized Gittaim by force, and, on the reconciliation effected by the execution of Saul's sons, returned to their allegiance to Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/3.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And all the people perceived it (i.e., his trouble), and it pleased them, as everything that the king did pleased all the people." </body></html>
