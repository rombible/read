Any possible ambiguity in the phrase “<span class= "ital">out of </span>Jerusalem” is removed by the expression in the parallel place (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-3.htm" title="And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more sons and daughters.">1Chronicles 14:3</a>), “<span class= "ital">at </span>Jerusalem.” Altogether, here and in Chronicles, the names of nineteen sons are mentioned; those of the daughters are not given, although one, Thamar, is mentioned in the story in 2 Samuel 13.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-13.htm" title="And David took him more concubines and wives out of Jerusalem, after he was come from Hebron: and there were yet sons and daughters born to David.">2 Samuel 5:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">David took him more concubines and wives — </span>This may well be reckoned among David’s miscarriages, the multiplication of wives being expressly forbidden to the kings of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-17.htm" title="Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.">Deuteronomy 17:17</a>. It may however be observed, perhaps in extenuation of this fault of David, that it has always been looked upon as a piece of political wisdom in princes to endeavour to have many children; that by matching them into potent families, they might strengthen their interest, and have the more supporters of their authority. And this seems to have been the reason why David took so many wives. Some of his first wives had no children, and he was induced to take others that he might obtain an issue, enlarge his family, and thereby strengthen his interest. But the many wives and concubines he took did not preserve him from coveting his neighbour’s wife. On the contrary, they inclined him to it; for men who have once broken the fence, will wander carelessly.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:11-16 David's house was not the worse, nor the less fit to be dedicated to God, for being built by the sons of the stranger. It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hiram king of Tyre - Now mentioned for the first time.

Well for him would it have been if, like Saul, he had been content with one wife. But this enlargement of his harem was gradual, and the list includes all the sons born at Jerusalem. Of these four, namely, Shammuah, Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon. were his children by Bathsheba (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>, where the names are differently spelt). Besides a variation in the spelling, two sons are mentioned in Chronicles, Nogah and an earlier Eliphelet, whose names are not given here, perhaps because they died young. From <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-9.htm">1 Chronicles 3:9</a> we learn that only the names of the sons of wives are given in these tables. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>However, David took the citadel Zion, i.e., "the city of David." This explanatory remark anticipates the course of events, as David did not give this name to the conquered citadel, until he had chosen it as his residence and capital (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>). &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; (Sion), from &#1510;&#1497;&#1492;, to be dry: the dry or arid mountain or hill. This was the name of the southern and loftiest mountain of Jerusalem. Upon this stood the fortress or citadel of the town, which had hitherto remained in the possession of the Jebusites; whereas the northern portion of the city of Jerusalem, which was upon lower ground, had been conquered by the Judaeans and Benjaminites very shortly after the death of Joshua (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/1-8.htm">Judges 1:8</a>). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a> we have one circumstance mentioned which occurred in connection with this conquest. On that day, i.e., when he had advanced to the attack of the citadel Zion, David said, "Every one who smites the Jebusites, let him hurl into the waterfall (i.e., down the precipice) both the lame and blind, who are hateful to David's soul." This is most probably the proper interpretation of these obscure words of David, which have been very differently explained. Taking up the words of the Jebusites, David called all the defenders of the citadel of Zion "lame and blind," and ordered them to be cast down the precipice without quarter. &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; signifies a waterfall (catarracta) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/42-8.htm">Psalm 42:8</a>, the only other passage in which it occurs, probably from &#1510;&#1504;&#1512;, to roar. This meaning may also be preserved here, if we assume that at the foot of the steep precipice of Zion there was a waterfall probably connected with the water of Siloah. It is true we cannot determine anything with certainty concerning it, as, notwithstanding the many recent researches in Jerusalem, the situation of the Jebusite fortress and the character of the mountain of Zion in ancient times are quite unknown to us. This explanation of the word zinnor is simpler than Ewald's assumption that the word signifies the steep side of a rock, which merely rests upon the fact that the Greek word &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2; originally signifies a plunge.<p>(Note: The earliest translators have only resorted to guesses. The Seventy, with their &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3be;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;, have combined &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512; with &#1510;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;, which they render now and then &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; or &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;. This is also done by the Syriac and Arabic. The Chaldee paraphrases in this manner: "who begins to subjugate the citadel." Jerome, who probably followed the Rabbins, has et tetigisset domatum fistulas (and touched the water-pipes); and Luther, "und erlanget die Dachrinnen" (like the English version, "whosoever getteth up to the gutter:" Tr.). Hitzig's notion, that zinnor signifies ear ("whosoever boxes the ears of the blind and lame") needs no refutation; nor does that of Fr. Bttcher, who proposes to follow the Alexandrian rendering, and refer zinnor to a "sword of honour or marshal's staff," which David promised to the victor.)<p>&#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1506; should be pointed as a Hiphil &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506;. The Masoretic pointing &#1493;&#1497;&#1490;&#1468;&#1506; arises from their mistaken interpretation of the whole sentence. The Chethibh &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1493; might be the third pers. perf., "who hate David's soul;" only in that case the omission of &#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; would be surprising, and consequently the Keri &#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1488;&#1497; is to be preferred. "From this," adds the writer, "the proverb arose, 'The blind and lame shall not enter the house;' " in which proverb the epithet "blind and lame," which David applied to the Jebusites who were hated by him, has the general signification of "repulsive persons," with whom one does not wish to have anything to do. In the Chronicles not only is the whole of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a> omitted, with the proverb to which the occurrence gave rise, but also the allusion to the blind and lame in the words spoken by the Jebusites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-6.htm">2 Samuel 5:6</a>); and another word of David's is substituted instead, namely, that David would make the man who first smote the Jebusites, i.e., who stormed their citadel, head and chief;<p>(Note: This is also inserted in the passage before us by the translators of the English version: "he shall be chief and captain." - Tr.)<p>and also the statement that Joab obtained the prize. The historical credibility of the statement cannot be disputed, as Thenius assumes, on the ground that Joab had already been chief (sar) for a long time, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-13.htm">2 Samuel 2:13</a> : for the passage referred to says nothing of the kind; and there is a very great difference between the commander of an army in the time of war, and a "head and chief," i.e., a commander-in-chief. The statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-8.htm">2 Samuel 5:8</a> with regard to Joab's part, the fortification of Jerusalem, shows very clearly that the author of the Chronicles had other and more elaborate sources in his possession, which contained fuller accounts than the author of our books has communicated.</body></html>
