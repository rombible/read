Here a Divine signal was to be given him in “the sound of a going,” or, rather, of a march. The word is used of the march of the hosts of the Lord in <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm" title="LORD, when you went out of Seir, when you marched out of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds also dropped water.">Judges 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-7.htm" title="O God, when you went forth before your people, when you did march through the wilderness; Selah:">Psalm 68:7</a>.

So that God gives David for a sign, the sound of many men’s feet walking, not on the tops of the trees, (for men do not walk there,) but on the ground amidst the trees, though nobody should be seen among them by any in David’s army. Probably the sound was to be heard by the Philistines, to whom it might appear as if a vast number of men were marching to fall upon them. The Hebrew, however, may be rendered, <span class="ital">When thou hearest the sound of a moving in the tops, </span>&c. And it may imply nothing more than a rushing and extraordinary sound among the trees, which was to be a signal for David’s attack. <span class="ital">Then bestir thyself — </span>Fall upon the Philistines. <span class="ital">For then the Lord shall go before thee — </span>By making such a noise either of a mighty host coming to assault them, or of something very extraordinary, that they shall be amazed, and confounded, and put to flight. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:17-25 The Philistines considered not that David had the presence of God with him, which Saul had forfeited and lost. The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, &c. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The mulberry trees - Rather, the Bacah-tree, and found abundantly near Mecca.

A rustling in the tops of the trees like the marching of an army was to be the signal that Jehovah Himself would lead David’s army to victory. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/7-6.htm" title="For the LORD had made the host of the Syrians to hear a noise of chariots, and a noise of horses, even the noise of a great host: and they said one to another, See, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of the Egyptians, to come on us.">2 Kings 7:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">bestir thyself</span>] In Chron. less forcibly “go out to battle.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">then shall the</span> Lord <span class="ital">go out before thee</span>] The use of the perfect tense in the original gives an emphasis to the assurance. “Then <span class="bld">hath Jehovah gone forth</span> before thee.” The E.

It would be in the morning that the wind would shake the treetops, but the sound was to be something more than the soft whispers of a gentle breeze. A gale was to put them into sudden motion, and then the soldiers would know that their Jehovah had gone forth to battle, and David must immediately <span class="accented">bestir</span> himself. The enthusiasm of his men must not cool down, but as soon as the wind rustled he must charge the enemy, and his warriors, feeling that they were going with the host of God, would break down all resistance by their impetuous onset. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David gains two Victories over the Philistines (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-8.htm">1 Chronicles 14:8-17</a>). - Both these victories belong in all probability to the interval between the anointing of David at Hebron over all Israel and the conquest of the citadel of Zion. This is very evident, so far as the first is concerned, from the words, "When the Philistines heard that they had anointed David king over Israel" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>), not when David had conquered the citadel of Zion. Moreover, when the Philistines approached, David "went down to the hold," or mountain fortress, by which we cannot possibly understand the citadel upon Zion, on account of the expression "went down." If David had been living upon Zion at the time, he would hardly have left this fortification when the Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim on the west of Jerusalem, but would rather have attacked and routed the enemy from the citadel itself. The second victory followed very soon after the first, and must therefore be assigned to the same period. The Philistines evidently resolved, as soon as the tidings reached them of the union of all the tribes under the sovereignty of David, that they would at once resist the growing power of Israel, and smite David before he had consolidated his government.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-18</a><p>"The Philistines went up to seek David," i.e., to seek him out and smite him. The expression &#1500;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; presupposes that David had not yet taken up his abode upon Zion. He had probably already left Hebron to make preparations for his attack upon the Jebusites. When he heard of the approach of the Philistines, he went down into the mountain fortress. "The hold" cannot be the citadel of Zion (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-9.htm">2 Samuel 5:9</a>), because this was so high that they had to go up to it on every side; and it is impossible to sustain the opinion advanced by Bertheau, that the verb &#1497;&#1512;&#1491; (to go down) is used for falling back into a fortification. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492; (the hold), with the definite article, is probably the mountain stronghold in the desert of Judah, into which David withdrew for a long time to defend himself from Saul (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-14.htm">2 Samuel 23:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-8.htm">1 Chronicles 12:8</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-18.htm">2 Samuel 5:18</a> the position of the Philistines is more minutely defined. The verse contains a circumstantial clause: "The Philistines had come and spread themselves out in the valley of Rephaim," a valley on the west of Jerusalem, and only separated from the valley of Ben-hinnom by a narrow ridge of land (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-8.htm">Joshua 15:8</a>). Instead of &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1496;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; the Chronicles have &#1497;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468;, they had invaded, which is perfectly equivalent so far as the sense is concerned.</body></html>
