But the pride and insolence of the Jebusites animated David, and the Lord God of hosts was with him. Thus in the day of God's power, Satan's strong-hold, the human heart, is changed into a habitation of God through the Spirit, and into a throne on which the Son of David rules, and brings every thought into obedience to himself. May He thus come, and claim, and cleanse, each of our hearts; and, destroying every idol, may he reign there for ever!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>David dwelt in the fort - or stronghold, (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-7.htm">2 Samuel 5:7</a>) i. e. eventually, when the buildings were completed, which may not have been for two or three years. Millo appears to have been a fortress of some kind, the northern defense of the city of David, and to have been a part of the original Canaanite defenses of Zion, as appears probable also from there having been a fortress called the house of Millo in the Canaanite city of Shechem. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a> note, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1-13</a> :20.) Millo may be the native name. Some identify it with the great platform called the Haram es Sherif.<p>David built round about - Probably meaning built his own house and other houses and streets, all, in short, that caused it to be coiled the city of David. (Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>.) The buildings were within, on the south of Millo, so as to be protected by it on the north, as they were east, west. and south, by the precipitous ravines. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. David dwelt in the fort, &c.&#8212;Having taken it by storm, he changed its name to "the city of David," to signify the importance of the conquest, and to perpetuate the memory of the event.<p>David built round about from Millo and inward&#8212;probably a row of stone bastions placed on the northern side of Mount Zion, and built by David to secure himself on that side from the Jebusites, who still lived in the lower part of the city. The house of Millo was perhaps the principal corner tower of that fortified wall.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Grew great</span> in reputation and power. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David went on, and grew great,....

In this and the six following verses (10-16) we have a summary of David's reign, telling us how he increased in prosperity because of the blessing of "Jehovah God of hosts." The birth of Solomon even is recorded in it, though it took place long afterwards. The insertion in this summary of Hiram's acknowledgment of David proves that this event made a great impression upon the minds of the people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The age of David when he began to reign is given here, viz., thirty years old; also the length of his reign, viz., seven years and a half at Hebron over Judah, and thirty-three years at Jerusalem over Israel and Judah. In the books of Chronicles these statements occur at the close of David's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/29-27.htm">1 Chronicles 29:27</a>). </body></html>
