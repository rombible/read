It is prophesied of the gospel church, The sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their kings shall minister unto thee, Isa 60:10. David's government was rooted and built up. David was established king; so is the Son of David, and all who, through him, are made to our God kings and priests. Never had the nation of Israel appeared so great as it began now to be. Many have the favour and love of God, yet do not perceive it, and so want the comfort of it; but to be exalted to that, and to perceive it, is happiness. David owned it was for his people's sake God had done great things for him; that he might be a blessing to them, and that they might be happy under him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hiram king of Tyre - Now mentioned for the first time.

David may have been induced to select the citadel of Zion as his palace, and by so doing to make Jerusalem the capital of the whole kingdom, partly by the natural strength of Zion, and partly by the situation of Jerusalem, viz., on the border of the tribes of Benjamin and Judah, and tolerably near to the centre of the land. "And David built, i.e., fortified (the city of Zion), round about from Millo and inwards." In the Chronicles we have &#1493;&#1506;&#1491;&#1470;&#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;, "and to the environs or surroundings," i.e., to the encircling wall which was opposite to the Millo. The fortification "inwards" must have consisted in the enclosure of Mount Zion with a strong wall upon the north side, where Jerusalem joined it as a lower town, so as to defend the palace against the hostile attacks on the north or town side, which had hitherto been left without fortifications. The "Millo" was at any rate some kind of fortification, probably a large tower or castle at one particular part of the surrounding wall (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-6.htm">Judges 9:6</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/9-46.htm">Judges 9:46</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/9-49.htm">Judges 9:49</a>, where Millo is used interchangeably with Migdal). The name ("the filling") probably originated in the fact that through this tower or castle the fortification of the city, or the surrounding wall, was filled or completed. The definite article before Millo indicates that it was a well-known fortress, probably one that had been erected by the Jebusites. With regard to the situation of Millo, we may infer from this passage, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-8.htm">1 Chronicles 11:8</a>, that the tower in question stood at one corner of the wall, either on the north-east or north-west, "where the hill of Zion has the least elevation and therefore needed the greatest strengthening from without" (Thenius on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a>). This is fully sustained both by <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-27.htm">1 Kings 11:27</a>, where Solomon is said to have closed the breach of the city of David by building (fortifying) Millo, and by <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-5.htm">2 Chronicles 32:5</a>, where Hezekiah is said to have built up all the wall of Jerusalem, and made Millo strong, i.e., to have fortified it still further (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-15.htm">1 Kings 9:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-24.htm">1 Kings 9:24</a>).</body></html>
