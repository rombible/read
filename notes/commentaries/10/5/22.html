The kingdom of the Messiah, as soon as it was set up in the world, was thus attacked by the powers of darkness. The heathen raged, and the kings of the earth set themselves to oppose it; but all in vain, Ps 2:1, &c. The destruction will turn, as this did, upon Satan's own kingdom. David owns dependence on God for victory; and refers himself to the good pleasure of God, Wilt thou do it? The assurance God has given us of victory over our spiritual enemies, should encourage us in our spiritual conflicts. David waited till God moved; he stirred then, but not till then. He was trained up in dependence on God and his providence. God performed his promise, and David failed not to improve his advantages. When the kingdom of the Messiah was to be set up, the apostles, who were to beat down the devil's kingdom, must not attempt any thing till they received the promise of the Spirit; who came with a sound from heaven, as of a rushing, mighty wind, Ac 2:2.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And there they left their images - An indication of the precipitancy of their flight, and the suddenness with which the Israelites burst upon them like a "breach of waters."

Retreating then to some distance, the Philistines called in their garrisons, and waited also for reinforcements from home, and then advanced again to the same spot. And as David was prepared to attack them in front, he also must now  have gathered round him the chivalry of Israel. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Elishua is written incorrectly in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6</a> as Elishama, because Elishama follows afterwards. There are two names after Elishua in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-6.htm">1 Chronicles 3:6-7</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-6.htm">1 Chronicles 14:6-7</a>, viz., Eliphalet and Nogah, which have not crept into the text from oversight or from a wrong spelling of other names, because the number of the names is given as nine in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-8.htm">1 Chronicles 3:8</a>, and the two names must be included in order to bring out that number. And, on the other hand, it is not by the mistake of a copyist that they have been omitted from the text before us, but it has evidently been done deliberately on account of their having died in infancy, or at a very early age. This also furnishes a very simple explanation of the fact, that the name Eliphalet occurs again at the end of the list, namely, because a son who was born later received the name of his brother who had died young. Eliada, the last but one, is called Beeliada in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/14-7.htm">1 Chronicles 14:7</a>, another form of the name, compounded with Baal instead of El. David had therefore nineteen sons, six of whom were born in Hebron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-2.htm">2 Samuel 3:2</a>.), and thirteen at Jerusalem. Daughters are not mentioned in the genealogical accounts, because as a rule only heiresses or women who acquired renown from special causes were included in them. There is a daughter named Thamar mentioned afterwards in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/13-1.htm">2 Samuel 13:1</a>. </body></html>
