He was willing to bear the shame of it, to have it ever before him, to be continually upbraided with it. God gives us leave to be earnest with him in prayer for particular blessings, from trust in his power and general mercy, though we have no particular promise to build upon. David patiently submitted to the will of God in the death of one child, and God made up the loss to his advantage, in the birth of another. The way to have creature comforts continued or restored, or the loss made up some other way, is cheerfully to resign them to God. God, by his grace, particularly owned and favoured that son, and ordered him to be called Jedidiah, Beloved of the Lord. Our prayers for our children are graciously and as fully answered when some of them die in their infancy, for they are well taken care of, and when others live, beloved of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon - Or "peaceable," a name given to him at his circumcision. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>. The giving of the name Jedidiah, by the Lord through Nathan, signified God's favor to the child, as in the cases of Abraham, Sarah, and Israel. The name Jedidiah (which contains the same root as the name David, namely, "to love") indicated, prophetically, what God's Providence brought about actually, namely, the succession and glorious reign of Solomon over Israel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 12:24, 25.

But Nathan gave him the name of Jedediah, by command of God, or perhaps only as an expression of God's love. This love and the noble gifts with which he was endowed, considering the criminality of the marriage from which he sprang, is a remarkable instance of divine goodness and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Either because of the Lord’s love to him, as the name signifies; or because the Lord commanded him to do so. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet,.... Either David did; he sent by him to Bathsheba, to acquaint her with the name of the child, that it was to be Solomon; which is not so likely: or "he, David, delivered it into the hand of Nathan the prophet"; to educate it, instruct it, and bring it up in the nurture of the Lord; or rather the Lord sent a message by Nathan the prophet to David, that he loved Solomon: <p>and he called his name Jedidiah, because of the Lord: that is, David also called him by this name, because of the love of the Lord unto him; for Jedidiah signifies "the beloved of the Lord"; a name and character which well agrees with the Messiah, Solomon's antitype, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-17.htm">Matthew 3:17</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/12.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And he sent by the hand of Nathan the <span class="cverse3">{p}</span> prophet; and <span class="cverse3">{q}</span> he called his name Jedidiah, because of the LORD.</span><p>(p) To call him Solomon.<p>(q) Meaning, David.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/12.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">he sent by the hand of Nathan</span>, &c.] Jehovah commissioned Nathan (for the phrase cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm" title="And he said, O my LORD, send, I pray you, by the hand of him whom you will send.">Exodus 4:13</a>) to give the boy a second name, which he did accordingly. This is the meaning of the text as it stands: but some commentators would alter it slightly in accordance with the Vulgate, and render <span class="ital">he</span> (David) <span class="ital">committed him to the hand of Nathan</span>, that he might take charge of his education. But the explanation is doubtful, and there is no further trace of the fact, though it has been very generally supposed that Nathan was Solomon’s tutor.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Jedidiah</span>] That is <span class="ital">Beloved of Jah.</span> Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-12.htm" title="And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.">Deuteronomy 33:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/127-2.htm" title="It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows: for so he gives his beloved sleep.">Psalm 127:2</a>. It is derived from the same root as David, which means <span class="ital">beloved</span> or <span class="ital">darling</span>. The name was given “because of the Lord,” i.e. because Jehovah loved the child; and it served as a pledge to David that he was again fully received into God’s favour.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He sent.</span> Some commentators make David the subject of the sentence, and translate, "And he, David, sent in the hand of Nathan, and called," etc. They suppose that this means that Nathan was entrusted with Solomon's education; but "in the hand" is the ordinary Hebrew preposition, meaning "by," and the sense plainly is that God sent a message by Nathan. David had already called the child Solomon, and now Jehovah, some years afterwards, gives him an indication of his special favour by naming him Yedidyah. The word is formed from the same root as <span class="accented">David</span>, that is, "lovely," with the addition of the Divine name. As we have already pointed out, this was no slight matter, but the virtual selection of Solomon to be David's successor, and probably, therefore, was delayed until he had given indica of his great intellectual gifts. His elder brothers would not be passed over without valid reasons. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David saw at once what had happened from their whispering conversation, and asked whether the child was dead. When they answered in the affirmative, he rose up from the ground, washed and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; that is to say, he laid aside all the signs of penitential grief and mourning, went into the house of the Lord (the holy tent upon Mount Zion) and worshipped, and then returned to his house, and had food set before him.</body></html>
