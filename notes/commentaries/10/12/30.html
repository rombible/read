Moreover, the weight of the crown, which is calculated to be equal to 100 or 125 pounds weight, is far too great for a man to wear. On the whole, it seems most probable that the idol Malcam is here meant. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>30. he took their king's crown from off his head&#8212;While the treasures of the city were given as plunder to his soldiers, David reserved to himself the crown, which was of rarest value. Its great weight makes it probable that it was like many ancient crowns, not worn, but suspended over the head, or fixed on a canopy on the top of the throne.<p>the precious stones&#8212;Hebrew, "stone"; was a round ball composed of pearls and other jewels, which was in the crown, and probably taken out of it to be inserted in David's own crown.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The weight whereof was a talent of gold, </span> or rather, <span class="ital">the price whereof</span>, &c.

And the addition of <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">precious stones, </span> which are never valued by the weight of gold, makes this signification here most proper and probable. Moreover, the weight might seem too great, either for the king of Ammon or for David, to wear it upon his head. Although, if this were meant of the weight, it might be said that this was not a crown to be worn ordinarily, but merely to be put on upon the king’s head at his coronation, or upon solemn occasions, as here where this was done, in token of the translation of this kingdom to David; and, it may be, it was held up or supported by two officers of state, that it might not be too burdensome to him, and after a little while taken off. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/12.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he took their king's crown from off his head,.... The crown of Hanun the king of the Ammonites, who now fell into his hands, and whom he stripped of his ensigns of royalty, who had so shamefully abused his ambassadors, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-4.htm">2 Samuel 10:4</a>, <p>(the weight whereof was a talent of gold with the precious stones): or, "and a precious stone"; there might be more, as our version suggests, but there was one in it remarkably large and valuable; Josephus (b) says it had in it a very precious stone, a sardonyx; and this, according to the Talmud (c) was of the value of a talent of gold. A talent was equal to three thousand shekels, as appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-25.htm">Exodus 38:25</a>; and was in value, according to Brerewood (d) of our money, 4500 pounds; but according to Bishop Cumberland (e) 5067 pounds, three shillings and ten pence. This crown was of the same value with the golden candlestick in the tabernacle, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-39.htm">Exodus 25:39</a>; and some think that value here is meant, and not the weight, a talent of gold being very heavy; according to Bishop Cumberland (f), ninety three and three quarter pounds; some say an hundred thirteen pounds ten ounces, and more; too great a weight to be borne on the head by Hanun or David; but, what with the gold and precious stones about it, it might be equal in value to a talent of gold; but weight is expressly mentioned, and the crowns of the eastern princes were of great bulk and weight, as well as value: Athenaeus (g) makes mention of one made of ten thousand pieces of gold, placed on the throne of King Ptolemy, and of some of two cubits, of six, yea, of sixteen cubits. Some (h) are of opinion that this crown was not the crown of the king of Ammon, but of Milcom or Molech, their idol, and that the proper name should be retained in the version, and that David had a crown made of it he could bear; but if, as others (i), the Syriac talent is meant, which was but the fourth part of an Hebrew one, the difficulty is greatly lessened; for it seems to be the same crown David afterwards wore, as follows: <p>and it was set on David's head; to show that the kingdom was translated to him, or was become subject to him; as Alexander, on the conquest of Darius, put the Persian diadem on his own head (k), in token of that monarchy being translated to him: though, after all, the phrase, "from off", may be rendered "from above" or "over" (l) his head, and so it was set "above" or "over" the head of David, being supported by some means or other, that its weight did not bear thereon however, Paschalius, who wrote a learned work, "De Coronis", must be mistaken when be says (m) this seems to be the first use of a crown in the kingdom of Judah, there being no mention of a crown before, either of Saul or David, only of anointing; since express mention is made of Saul's crown, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-10.htm">2 Samuel 1:10</a>; though his observation may be just, that this crown, allowed to be worn by David, was a pledge of the renewal of his royal dignity, and of his acceptance with God upon his repentance for his above sins: <p>and he brought forth the spoil of the city in great abundance; which, or at least part of it, was dedicated to the building of the sanctuary, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-11.htm">2 Samuel 8:11</a>. <p>(b) Ut supra.

The Sept. now reads <span class="ital">Molchom their king</span>, “their king” being probably a gloss, and “Molchom” the original reading. A Jewish tradition recorded by Jerome tells how the crown was snatched from the head of Milcom by Ittai the Gittite, because it was unlawful for a Hebrew to take spoil from an idol (<span class="ital">Quaest. Hebr.</span> on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-2.htm" title="And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious stones in it; and it was set on David's head: and he brought also exceeding much spoil out of the city.">1 Chronicles 20:2</a>). But while it was natural for David to take and wear the king’s crown, as the symbol of the subjection of the Ammonites to his rule, would he not have regarded the idol’s crown with abhorrence, and have shrunk from wearing it?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">a talent of gold</span>] Estimated at more than 100 pounds. If this estimate is correct, it can never have been habitually worn, and must have been placed on David’s head for a few moments only.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 30.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Malcam.</span> This is another mode of spelling Milcom, the god of the Ammonites, and is found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-5.htm">Zephaniah 1:5</a>, and probably in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. Strictly, Milcom or Malcom is a proper name for the supreme deity, formed from the word <span class="accented">melec</span>, a king, or, as it was pronounced in other Semitic dialects, Moloch. Grammatically, <span class="accented">Malcam</span> also means "their king," and even so belongs to Milcom. For the crown weighed a hundred pounds, a ponderous mass, which no man could possibly bear, and, least of all, when making, as was the case with the Ammonite king, his last stand for his life. But after the capture of the city, it was lifted from the head of the idol, and placed formally upon David's head, and held there for a few moments, as a sign of victory and of rejoicing over the fall of the false god. There is no reason for supposing that there is any exaggeration in the weight, nor will the Hebrew allow us to understand the talent of gold as referring to its value. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-23.htm">2 Samuel 12:23</a> is paraphrased very correctly by Clericus: "I shall go to the dead, the dead will not come to me." - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>. David then comforted his wife Bathsheba, and lived with her again; and she bare a son, whom he called Solomon, the man of peace (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). David gave the child this name, because he regarded his birth as a pledge that he should now become a partaker again of peace with God, and not from any reference to the fact that the war with the Ammonites was over, and peace prevailed when he was born; although in all probability Solomon was not born till after the capture of Rabbah and the termination of the Ammonitish war. His birth is mentioned here simply because of its connection with what immediately precedes. The writer adds (in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-24.htm">2 Samuel 12:24</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-25.htm">2 Samuel 12:25</a>), "And Jehovah loved him, and sent by the hand (through the medium) of Nathan the prophet; and he called his son Jedidiah (i.e., beloved of Jehovah), for Jehovah's sake." The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; (he sent) cannot be David, because this would not yield any appropriate sense, but must be Jehovah, the subject of the clause immediately preceding. "To send by the hand," i.e., to make a mission by a person (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-13.htm">Exodus 4:13</a>, etc.), is equivalent to having a commission performed by a person, or entrusting a person with a commission to another. We learn from what follows, in what the commission with which Jehovah entrusted Nathan consisted: "And he (Nathan, not Jehovah) called his (the boy's) name Jedidiah." And if Nathan is the subject to "called," there is nothing to astonish in the expression "because of the Lord." The idea is this: Nathan came to David according to Jehovah's instructions, and gave Solomon the name Jedidiah for Jehovah's sake, i.e., because Jehovah loved him. The giving of such a name was a practical declaration on the part of Jehovah that He loved Solomon, from which David could and was intended to discern that the Lord had blessed his marriage with Bathsheba. Jedidiah, therefore, was not actually adopted as Solomon's name. </body></html>
