It is without doubt mentioned here (after the custom of Scripture narrative) to close the story of Bath-sheba in its proper connection. The birth of that son who should succeed to the kingdom, and through whom should pass the line to the Messiah, was too important to be overlooked.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/12.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-24.htm" title="And David comforted Bathsheba his wife, and went in to her, and lay with her: and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon: and the LORD loved him....">2 Samuel 12:24-25</a></span>. <span class="ital">And David comforted Bath-sheba his wife — </span>Who, no doubt, was deeply afflicted for the loss of her child, and dejected for her sin. It is observable, however, that there is not one word said to her in all this relation, either concerning her guilt or her punishment. She was punished in the calamities that befell David; who enticed her, and not she him, to commit the foul sin of adultery, and was innocent in the murder of Uriah. <span class="ital">She bare a son, and he called his name Solomon — </span>Probably his mother, with the consent of David, gave him this name as soon as he was born. <span class="ital">And the Lord loved him — </span>That is, the Lord declared to David, probably by Nathan the prophet, that he loved this his son, notwithstanding the just cause which David had given to God to withdraw his love from him and his. Perhaps after his great humiliation, Nathan was sent to comfort him with this good hope, that God would have a peculiar regard for this son, and make him very famous. Such is the wonderful goodness of God to truly penitent sinners, who manifest the sincerity of their repentance by an humble submission to whatsoever punishments God sees fit to inflict upon them, (as David did to the death of the former child,) and thereby induce that goodness to show them still further mercy, <span class="ital">He sent — </span>Namely, God did; <span class="ital">by Nathan, and he called his name Jedidiah — </span>That is, <span class="ital">beloved of Jehovah. Because of the Lord — </span>Either because of the Lord’s love to him, or because the Lord commanded him so to do. This name, however, was merely significative, being only intended to express to the child’s parents what they might expect; for we find him always called Solomon in the Scriptures.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:15-25 David now penned the 51st Psalm, in which, though he had been assured that his sin was pardoned, he prays earnestly for pardon, and greatly laments his sin. He was willing to bear the shame of it, to have it ever before him, to be continually upbraided with it. God gives us leave to be earnest with him in prayer for particular blessings, from trust in his power and general mercy, though we have no particular promise to build upon. David patiently submitted to the will of God in the death of one child, and God made up the loss to his advantage, in the birth of another. The way to have creature comforts continued or restored, or the loss made up some other way, is cheerfully to resign them to God. God, by his grace, particularly owned and favoured that son, and ordered him to be called Jedidiah, Beloved of the Lord. Our prayers for our children are graciously and as fully answered when some of them die in their infancy, for they are well taken care of, and when others live, beloved of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/12.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Solomon - Or "peaceable," a name given to him at his circumcision. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm">Luke 1:59</a>. The giving of the name Jedidiah, by the Lord through Nathan, signified God's favor to the child, as in the cases of Abraham, Sarah, and Israel. The name Jedidiah (which contains the same root as the name David, namely, "to love") indicated, prophetically, what God's Providence brought about actually, namely, the succession and glorious reign of Solomon over Israel. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/12.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 12:24, 25.

But Nathan gave him the name of Jedediah, by command of God, or perhaps only as an expression of God's love. This love and the noble gifts with which he was endowed, considering the criminality of the marriage from which he sprang, is a remarkable instance of divine goodness and grace.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/12.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">David comforted Bathsheba; </span> who was now much dejected, both for her former sin, which she truly repented of, as may be gathered from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/proverbs/31-1.htm" title="The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught him....">Proverbs 31:1-3</a></span>, &c., and for the loss of that child which was very dear to her, and which might seem to be the only tie of David’s affection to her; which being now dead, she might think that David would utterly cast her off, and leave her to that shame and punishment which she had deserved. Went in unto her, to wit, into her chamber or bed.

Which is the first time she is so called, Uriah being dead, and David having married her; which though at first displeasing to the Lord, because the circumstances attending it, was afterwards confirmed by him. Bathsheba no doubt was very much distressed, and greatly disconsolate, on account of the sin she had committed, and because of the wrath and displeasure of God, and because of the death of the child, which was a token of it; and she might have some scruples in her mind whether it was lawful to continue cohabiting with David. Now David comforted her, by telling her that God had pardoned that iniquity they had been guilty of, and that he would give them another son, who should succeed him in the throne, and build an house for his name: <p>and went in unto her, and lay with her, as his wife: <p>and she bare a son; at the proper time: <p>and he called his name Solomon; either the Lord called him so, or David by his direction; for this name was given before his birth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>; the Keri or marginal reading is, "and she called his name", &amp;c. that is, Bathsheba, who had been informed by David that this was the name the Lord would have him called by, which signifies "peaceable"; and the birth of this son was a confirmation of the peace and reconciliation between God and them, and which his name carried in it; as well as pointed to the peaceable times that should be during his reign, and in which be was a type of Christ, the Prince; of peace; who is the author of peace between God and men by the blood of his cross, and from whom spiritual peace flows, and by whom eternal peace and happiness is: <p>and the Lord loved him; and was to him a father, and he to him a son, as was promised, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14</a>.

The birth of Solomon<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">24</span>. <span class="ital">he called his name Solomon</span>] The name was given at the time of circumcision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-59.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.">Luke 1:59</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-21.htm" title="And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, which was so named of the angel before he was conceived in the womb.">Luke 2:21</a>). The Hebrew form of the name is <span class="ital">Shĕlômôh</span>, the Sept. Salômôn, which by the time of the N.T. had become shortened to the familiar Solomon. It signifies <span class="ital">peaceable</span>, and was given him in anticipation of the peace and quietness promised to Israel in his reign in contrast to his father’s wars (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/22-9.htm" title="Behold, a son shall be born to you, who shall be a man of rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace and quietness to Israel in his days.">1 Chronicles 22:9</a>). Solomon’s birth is naturally related as the sequel to the preceding narrative, though in all probability it did not take place until some four or five years afterwards. See Introd. ch. IV. § 3, p. 26, and note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-14.htm" title="And these be the names of those that were born to him in Jerusalem; Shammuah, and Shobab, and Nathan, and Solomon,">2 Samuel 5:14</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/12.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He called his name Solomon.</span> It is rashly assumed that Solomon's birth followed next in order after that of the deceased child. More probably there was a long interval of time, and son after son was born, with little increase of happiness to the family polluted by Amnon's sin and troubled by its miserable consequences. While we must not lay too great stress upon Solomon calling himself "a little child" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-7.htm">1 Kings 3:7</a>) after his accession, yet it forbids our believing that he was more than just grown up, It was the remarkable ability of Solomon, his goodness and precocious talent, which made him so great a comfort to his parents, and which received Jehovah's seal of approval in the name <span class="accented">Jedidiah.</span> This name would scarcely be given him until his good and great qualities were developing; and as it was a sort of indication that he was the chosen and elect son of David, and therefore the next king, we shall probably be right in believing that this second mission of Nathan, and this mark of Divine favour to David's youngest child, did not take place until after Absalom's death, possibly not until Solomon was ten or twelve years of age. The name <span class="accented">Solomon</span> means "the peaceful," and answers to the German <span class="accented">Friedrich.</span> It was given to the child in recognition that David's wars were now over, and that the era of quiet had begun, which was to be consecrated to the building of Jehovah's temple. It was the name given to the infant at his birth, and was a name of hope. Alas! this peace was to be rudely broken by the rebellion of the son whom David, in vain expectation and with all a father's pride, had named <span class="accented">Absalom</span>, "his father's peace." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>On the seventh day, when the child died, the servants of David were afraid to tell him of its death; for they said (to one another), "Behold, while the child was still living, we spoke to him, and he did not hearken to our voice; how should we say to him, now the child is dead, that he should do harm?" (i.e., do himself an injury in the depth of his anguish.) </body></html>
