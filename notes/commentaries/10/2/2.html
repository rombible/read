David, by God's Direction, Goes Up to Hebron, and Is Made King over Judah.<p>1-4. David inquired of the Lord&#8212;By Urim (1Sa 23:6, 9; 30:7, 8). He knew his destination, but he knew also that the providence of God would pave the way. Therefore he would take no step in such a crisis of his own and the nation's history, without asking and obtaining the divine direction. He was told to go into Judah, and fix his headquarters in Hebron, whither he accordingly repaired with his now considerable force. There his interests were very powerful; for he was not only within his own tribe, and near chiefs with whom he had been long in friendly relations (see on [257]1Sa 30:26), but Hebron was the capital and center of Judah, and one of the Levitical cities; the inhabitants of which were strongly attached to him, both from sympathy with his cause ever since the massacre at Nob, and from the prospect of realizing in his person their promised pre-eminence among the tribes. The princes of Judah, therefore, offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was accepted. More could not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of the country (1Ch 11:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So David went up thither,....

Notwithstanding their difference of character, and the very opposite attitude which they assumed towards David, the noble Jonathan did not forsake his father, although his fierce hatred towards the friend whom Jonathan loved as his own soul might have undermined his attachment to his father. The two predicates, &#1504;&#1488;&#1492;&#1489;, loved and amiable, and &#1504;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, affectionate or kind, apply chiefly to Jonathan; but they were also suitable to Saul in the earliest years of his reign, when he manifested the virtues of an able ruler, which secured for him the lasting affection and attachment of the people. In his mourning over the death of the fallen hero, David forgets all the injury that Saul has inflicted upon him, so that he only brings out and celebrates the more amiable aspects of his character. The light motion or swiftness of an eagle (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-8.htm">Habakkuk 1:8</a>), and the strength of a lion (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-10.htm">2 Samuel 17:10</a>), were the leading characteristics of the great heroes of antiquity. - Lastly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-24.htm">2 Samuel 1:24</a>, David commemorates the rich booty which Saul had brought to the nation, for the purpose of celebrating his heroic greatness in this respect as well. &#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1497; was the scarlet purple (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/25-4.htm">Exodus 25:4</a>).
