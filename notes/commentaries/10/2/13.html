The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up his servant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of true godliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through various difficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin.

Possibly he had been summoned to yield his kingdom up to Ishbosheth as the rightful lord, but, while taking no measures to extend his rule, he felt himself  justified in defending his election to be king ever Judah. <span class="accented">The pool of Gibeon</span> is described by Robinson ('Researches,' 2:136) as "an open tank about a hundred and twenty feet in length and a hundred in breadth, surrounded by a grove of olive trees. Above it, excavated in the rock, is a subterranean reservoir, to receive the water from a copious spring, from which the overflow descends into the tank below." As neither party was willing to shed the first blood in a civil war, of which the Philistines would reap the benefit, they both halted in sight of one another on opposite sides of the hill, with the tank below them in the middle. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And now," sc., that ye have shown this love to Saul your lord, "may Jehovah show you grace and truth." "Grace and truth" are connected together, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/34-6.htm">Exodus 34:6</a>, as the two sides by which the goodness of God is manifested to men, namely in His forgiving grace, and in His trustworthiness, or the fulfilment of His promises (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-10.htm">Psalm 25:10</a>). "And I also show you this good," namely the prayer for the blessing of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-5.htm">2 Samuel 2:5</a>), because ye have done this (to Saul). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-7.htm">2 Samuel 2:7</a> there is attached to this the demand, that now that Saul their lord was dead, and the Judaeans had anointed him (David) king, they would show themselves valiant, namely valiant in their reverence and fidelity towards David, who had become their king since the death of Saul. &#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1492;, i.e., be comforted, spirited (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-11.htm">Judges 7:11</a>). It needed some resolution and courage to recognise David as king, because Saul's army had fled to Gilead, and there was good ground for apprehending opposition to David on the part of Abner. Ishbosheth, however, does not appear to have been proclaimed king yet; or at any rate the fact was not yet known to David. &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; does not belong to &#1488;&#1514;&#1497;, but to the whole clause, as &#1488;&#1514;&#1497; is placed first merely for the sake of emphasis. </body></html>
