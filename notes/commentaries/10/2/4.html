Comp. Saul’s anointing by Samuel privately (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1Samuel 10:1</a>), and his subsequent double recognition as king by the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm" title="And Samuel said to all the people, See you him whom the LORD has chosen, that there is none like him among all the people? And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.">1Samuel 10:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm" title="And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.">1Samuel 11:15</a>). The “men of Judah” were not only of David’s tribe, but were doubtless aware of his having been divinely selected for their future king, and, for the most part, had been on friendly terms with him during his long outlawry; they had also lately received presents from him in recognition of their kindness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1Samuel 30:26-31</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The men of Jabesh-gilead.</span>—This town had been destroyed in the civil war against the tribe of Benjamin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/judges/21-9.htm" title="For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.">Judges 21:9-12</a>), and its 400 virgins given in marriage to the surviving Benjamites. There was therefore a special connection between Saul, who was of the tribe of Benjamin, and this city. It is altogether probable also that the remnants of Saul’s defeated army had sought refuge in Gilead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-4.htm" title="And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.

This had long ceased to be a secret. Jonathan had known it perfectly. Saul himself had been no stranger to it; and Abner, the general of his army, was not ignorant of it, as appears by his words to Ish-bosheth, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/3-8.htm" title="Then was Abner very wroth for the words of Ishbosheth, and said, Am I a dog's head, which against Judah do show kindness this day to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not delivered you into the hand of David, that you charge me to day with a fault concerning this woman?...">2 Samuel 3:8-9</a>,) and his message to the elders of Israel; and it was now universally known, at least to the men of Judah, and was the avowed reason why they advanced David to the throne. And it was reason sufficient, God’s will being obligatory upon all, and all being indispensably bound to obey it. This had been the sole foundation of Saul’s title to the kingdom, and on this ground only the Israelites had accepted him for their king. But this ground of claim Ish- bosheth, Saul’s son, had not, for he had not been appointed by God nor anointed by Samuel, or any other prophet. Indeed, properly speaking, he had no ground of claim at all, as the crown was never made hereditary in Saul’s family, but remained entirely at God’s disposal, who was the supreme king and governor of Israel, The men of Judah therefore were resolved to comply with the will and appointment of God, and not to neglect their duty, although they saw that the other tribes would neglect theirs. Yet they act with modesty; they make him king of Judah only, and not of all Israel. “Whether they did this with more despatch,” says Delaney, “to influence the determinations of the other tribes in his favour; or, whether it was delayed until their dispositions were sounded upon the point, is nowhere said. This, however, is certain, that one tribe’s acting separate and independent of the rest, was of dangerous example; nor could any thing but the divine authority justify it; and therefore it is not probable that this step was taken until all other expedients for a unanimous election had failed. And here he began the division of the kingdom, so lately predicted by Samuel;” as also, in part, the accomplishment of the prophecy delivered by Jacob, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a>,) that the sceptre should be settled in Judah.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-7.

His first anointing indicated God's secret purpose, his second the accomplishment of that purpose. (Compare the case of Saul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm">1 Samuel 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-14.htm">1 Samuel 11:14</a>.) David was anointed again king over Israel <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>. The interval between the anointing of the Lord Jesus as the Christ of God, and His taking to Himself His kingdom and glory, seems to be thus typified. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 2<p>2Sa 2:1-7. David, by God's Direction, Goes Up to Hebron, and Is Made King over Judah.<p>1-4. David inquired of the Lord&#8212;By Urim (1Sa 23:6, 9; 30:7, 8). He knew his destination, but he knew also that the providence of God would pave the way. Therefore he would take no step in such a crisis of his own and the nation's history, without asking and obtaining the divine direction. He was told to go into Judah, and fix his headquarters in Hebron, whither he accordingly repaired with his now considerable force. There his interests were very powerful; for he was not only within his own tribe, and near chiefs with whom he had been long in friendly relations (see on [257]1Sa 30:26), but Hebron was the capital and center of Judah, and one of the Levitical cities; the inhabitants of which were strongly attached to him, both from sympathy with his cause ever since the massacre at Nob, and from the prospect of realizing in his person their promised pre-eminence among the tribes. The princes of Judah, therefore, offered him the crown over their tribe, and it was accepted. More could not, with prudence, be done in the circumstances of the country (1Ch 11:3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They anointed David king over the house of Judah:</span> this they did upon just grounds, because not only the kingdom was promised to that tribe, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm" title="The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and to him shall the gathering of the people be.">Genesis 49:10</a></span>, but David was designed and anointed by God, whose will both they and all Israel were obliged to observe and obey. And they piously resolved not to neglect their duty, though they saw the other tribes would. Yet their prudent caution and modesty is observable, that they make him king of Judah only, and not of all Israel.

The inhabitants of the tribe of Judah came from the several parts of it to Hebron, that is, the principal of them, the elders of each city: <p>and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah; they did not take upon them to make him king over all Israel, but left the rest of the tribes to act for themselves; and no doubt in this they had the mind of David, who was not willing to force himself upon the people at once, but by degrees get the whole government into his hands, as Providence should make his way; these men knew the kingdom was promised to their tribe, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>; and were quite clear in what they did, and, without question, knew that David had been anointed by Samuel: but as that anointing was only a declaration of the Lord's choice of him, and of his will that he should be king after Saul's death, he is again anointed by the people, as an inauguration into his office: <p>and they told David, saying, that the men of Jabeshgilead were they that buried Saul. It is highly probable, that as soon as David was anointed king, the first thing he thought of was to inquire after the body of the late king, and give it an honourable interment, and upon inquiry was told that the men of Jabeshgilead had buried him already.

No doubt he had previously secured the support of the elders. Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/30-26.htm" title="And when David came to Ziklag, he sent of the spoil to the elders of Judah, even to his friends, saying, Behold a present for you of the spoil of the enemies of the LORD;">1 Samuel 30:26</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they anointed David</span>] David had already been anointed privately by Samuel to mark God’s choice of him as the future king, but it was natural that the ceremony should now be repeated publicly as the formal inauguration of his reign, and even a third time, when he was made king over all Israel (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm" title="So all the elders of Israel came to the king to Hebron; and king David made a league with them in Hebron before the LORD: and they anointed David king over Israel.">2 Samuel 5:3</a>). Similarly Saul was first privately anointed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1 Samuel 10:1</a>), and afterwards publicly installed in his office, and possibly anointed a second time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/11-14.htm" title="Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal, and renew the kingdom there....">1 Samuel 11:14-15</a>, note). On the significance of the rite of anointing see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-1.htm" title="Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it on his head, and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD has anointed you to be captain over his inheritance?">1 Samuel 10:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">And they told David</span>] The connexion is obscure. We should expect a fresh verse and paragraph. Apparently either the announcement was intended to indicate the quarter in which opposition to his authority was most probable, or it was an answer to David’s inquiry whether the body of his predecessor had received fitting burial. In either case the embassy to the men of Jabesh was prompted by policy no less than by gratitude. If David could secure the support of the capital of Gilead (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm" title="Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you.">1 Samuel 11:1</a>), he might reckon on speedily extending his power over the whole country. His conciliatory message is virtually an appeal to them to recognise him as Saul’s legitimate successor.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">They anointed David.</span> Samuel's anointing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-13.htm">1 Samuel 16:13</a>) had been private, and, if we may judge by the manner in which Eliab treated David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-28.htm">1 Samuel 17:28</a>), even his own family had not attached much importance to it. It was nevertheless the indication of Jehovah's purpose, and now the anointing of David by the elders of Judah was the first step towards its accomplishment. And this was an independent act, though the knowledge of Samuel's anointing had prepared the way for it; and David thus acquired a legal right and authority by the nation's will, which Samuel could not have given him. So Saul's anointing by Samuel, and his election to be king at Gilgal, were independent acts; and while the former gave the king his sacredness, the latter conferred upon him jurisdiction and power. <span class="cmt_word">King over the house of Judah.</span> How came the Philistines to allow this? When subsequently he was again anointed, and became King of all Israel, the Philistines gathered their hosts at once; not because he captured Jerusalem, which was then a mere hill fort belonging to the Jebusites, but evidently because they thought him dangerous. But why did they not crush him now? One reason, probably, was that Judaea was a difficult country for military operations. The tribe, too, had stood aloof from Saul, and its strength was unbroken. But the chief reason apparently  was that David maintained friendly relations with Achish, and paid him tribute. This explains the curious fact that Ziklag continued to be the private property of the house of David (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-6.htm">1 Samuel 27:6</a>). The doings of a vassal of the King of Gath were regarded as of little importance. Had he not even marched with them to Aphek, as one of the servants of Achish? But when he endeavoured to restore the kingdom of Saul, they first made a hasty rush upon him, and, when repelled, they gathered their forces for as formidable an invasion as that which had ended in their victory at Gilboa. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second strophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>) only applies to the friendship of Jonathan:<p>25  Oh how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!<p>Jonathan (is) slain upon thy heights!<p>26  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:<p>Thou wast very kind to me:<p>Stranger than the love of woman was thy love to me!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a> is almost a verbal repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>. &#1510;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>) denotes the pinching or pressure of the heart consequent upon pain and mourning. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;, third pers. fem., like a verb &#1492;&#1500; with the termination lengthened (vid., Ewald, 194, b.), to be wonderful or distinguished. &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1498;, thy love to me.
