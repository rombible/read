Asahel Slain.<p>19-32. Asahel pursued after Abner&#8212;To gain the general's armor was deemed the grandest trophy. Asahel, ambitious of securing Abner's, had outstripped all other pursuers, and was fast gaining on the retreating commander. Abner, conscious of possessing more physical power, and unwilling that there should be "blood" between himself and Joab, Asahel's brother, twice urged him to desist. The impetuous young soldier being deaf to the generous remonstrance, the veteran raised the pointed butt of his lance, as the modern Arabs do when pursued, and, with a sudden back thrust, transfixed him on the spot, so that he fell, and lay weltering in his blood. But Joab and Abishai continued the pursuit by another route till sunset. On reaching a rising ground, and receiving a fresh reinforcement of some Benjamites, Abner rallied his scattered troops and earnestly appealed to Joab's better feelings to stop the further effusion of blood, which, if continued, would lead to more serious consequences&#8212;a destructive civil war. Joab, while upbraiding his opponent as the sole cause of the fray, felt the force of the appeal and led off his men; while Abner probably dreading a renewal of the attack when Joab should learn his brother's fate, and vow fierce revenge, endeavored, by a forced march, to cross the Jordan that night. On David's side the loss was only nineteen men, besides Asahel. But of Ish-bosheth's party there fell three hundred and sixty. This skirmish is exactly similar to the battles of the Homeric warriors, among whom, in the flight of one, the pursuit by another, and the dialogue held between them, there is vividly represented the style of ancient warfare.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The hinder end of the spear</span> was sharp-pointed, after the manner. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Under the fifth rib; </span> the seat of the liver and bowels, where wounds are mortal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the same place; </span> upon the spot, not being able to go one step further. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Howbeit, he refused to turn aside,....

There are twelve ribs, seven of which are called true ones, and five spurious; if this was the fifth of the seven, the spear must pierce the breast (k), and strike the seat of life, the heart and lungs; if the fifth from the eighth and first of the spurious ones, then wounding the hypochondria, it must pass to the vital bowels of the abdomen, which seems to be the case here (l): according to some (m) this is meant of the inferior ribs, which we call the short ribs, and any of these five are called the fifth rib; and Abner must strike him in the right side, because he was behind him, and which stroke must be deadly, because he struck him through the liver: <p>that the spear came out behind him: the thrust was so violent that the spear went through him, and came out at his back: <p>and he fell down and died in the same place; he fell at once, and died on the spot immediately: <p>and it came to pass, that as many as came to the place where Asahel fell down and died stood still; that is, such of David's men who were in the pursuit after the Israelites, when they came to the spot, and saw Asahel dead, they had no power to proceed in the pursuit, being so troubled and grieved at the death of him. <p>(i) T.

The only thing connected with this, of which we have any further account, is the slaughter of Asahel by Abner, which is mentioned here (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-18.htm">2 Samuel 2:18-23</a>) on account of the important results which followed. Of the three sons of Zeruiah, viz., Joab, Abishai, and Asahel, Asahel was peculiarly light of foot, like one of the gazelles; and he pursued Abner most eagerly, without turning aside to the right or to the left. </body></html>
