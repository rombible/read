The nation in general refused David. By this the Lord trained up his servant for future honour and usefulness; and the tendency of true godliness was shown in his behaviour while passing through various difficulties. David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin. But he is unworthy the name of a man, that can thus trifle with human blood.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forty ... two - The numerals are somewhat strange. First, as regards the 40 years. Even assuming that Ish-bosheth's reign did not commence until five and a half years after Saul's death, which must have been the case if the two years in the text gives the true length of his reign, it is startling to hear of Saul's younger son being 35 years old at his father's death, born consequently some three years before his father's accession, and five years older than David, the bosom friend of his older brother Jonathan. The age, too, of Jonathan's child, Mephibosheth, who was five years old at his father's death, would lead one to expect rather a less age for his uncle. Next, as regards the two years. Since David (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-11.htm">2 Samuel 2:11</a>; and marginal references) reigned seven years in Hebron over Judah only, it follows, if the two years in the text are correct, either that an interval of five years elapsed between Ish-bosheth's death and David's being anointed "king over all Israel," or that a like interval elapsed between Saul's death and the commencement of Ish-bosheth's reign. Of the two the latter is the more probable, and has the advantage of diminishing Ish-bosheth's age by between five and six years. But the narrative in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3.htm">2 Samuel 3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/4-1.htm">2 Samuel 4:1-12</a> of the "long war," of the birth of David's six sons, and of Abner's conspiracy and death, seems to imply a longer time than two years, in which case both the numerals would have to be corrected. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. over Gilead&#8212;used in a loose sense for the land beyond Jordan.<p>Ashurites&#8212;the tribe of Asher in the extreme north.<p>Jezreel&#8212;the extensive valley bordering on the central tribes.<p>over all Israel &#8230; But Judah&#8212;David neither could nor would force matters.

Being born the same year his father began to reign. See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-6.htm">1 Samuel 31:6</a>, <p>and reigned two years; which some understand of these, and no more; and whereas David reigned seven years and a half over Judah, before he reigned over all Israel, it is thought by the Jewish chronologer (c) that there was a vacancy in the throne of Israel for the space of five years, and so says Kimchi; which vacancy was either before the reign of Ishbosheth, it being a matter in dispute whether he or Mephibosheth should be set up, or after his death; the tribes of Israel being so long before they acknowledged David their king; or Ishbosheth's reign of two years must be in the middle of David's reign over Judah; but there is no need to suppose either of these, for the text says not that Ishbosheth reigned only two years; but the meaning is, as Ben Gersom observes, that he had reigned two years when the following things happened, and a war began, and not by him but by Abner, and carried on by him; and he being an inactive prince, the rest of his reign was reckoned as no reign, whereas he lived and reigned the same length of time David did over Judah; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-1.htm">2 Samuel 3:1</a>, <p>but the house of Judah followed David; kept close to him as their king, yielding a cheerful obedience to him. <p>(c) Seder Olam Rabba, c. 13. p. 37. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.

As it stands, it involves a double difficulty. (<span class="ital">a</span>) About 32 years is the most that can be assigned to Saul’s reign (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-1.htm" title="Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over Israel,">1 Samuel 13:1</a>, and Introd. to 1 Sam. p. 23, so that it represents his youngest son as born before his accession, which is improbable. (<span class="ital">b</span>) Ish-bosheth’s eldest brother Jonathan seems to have been about the same age as David, and therefore not much more than thirty at the time of his death.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">two years</span>] The duration of Ish-bosheth’s reign is probably reckoned from the time when Abner succeeded in establishing his authority over <span class="ital">all</span> Israel. Five years and a half were occupied with the reconquest of the land from the Philistines, and these two years synchronize with the last two of David’s reign at Hebron. No great interval seems to have elapsed between the deaths of Abner and Ish-bosheth, and David’s recognition as king of Israel.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10, 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth...two years ... David... seven years and six months</span>. Where are we to place the five years and a half of difference? The usual assumption is that David was made King of Israel immediately upon Ishbosheth's murder; but this is wrong. We cannot believe that Abner would allow so long a period as five years to elapse before asserting the claims of Saul's family, especially as David was already made King of Judah at Hebron. Still, as the war with the Philistines was the first object of his care, and as some form of popular ratification was necessary, some months may have passed before Ishbosheth was publicly installed as king, though Abner must have acted in his name from the first. The main interval of five years before David's accession must have been after Ishbosheth's death. That murder, and still more so the murder of Abner, must have made David an object of great suspicion to all Israel. Shimei, when he called him "a bloody man" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-8.htm">2 Samuel 16:8</a>), was but uttering a slander commonly current among the people. Gradually most of them would become convinced of his innocence; and all, as they contrasted the anarchy which prevailed in their country with the peace and security won by David for Judah, would regard his election as the best course under the circumstances. As the Philistines immediately resented their action, and endeavoured to crush the king before he could concentrate his power, it is probable that during these five years they had again obtained practical command of the more fertile districts of Palestine. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth... was forty years old.</span> In the previous narrative Jonathan always appears as the most important of Saul's sons, and naturally it is assumed that he was the firstborn; yet his child was but five years old at his father's death, while Ishbosheth, his uncle, a younger brother of Jonathan, is described as a man of forty. Some think that Ishbosheth was the eldest son, but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a> he is placed last, and, though a weak man, was not so feeble as to have been set aside from the succession. But confessedly the chronology of Saul's reign is so full of difficulties, that it is impossible altogether to explain it (see note on 1 Samuel 13:1). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David's return to Hebron, and anointing as king over Judah. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-1.htm">2 Samuel 2:1</a>. "After this," i.e., after the facts related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1.htm">2 Samuel 1</a>, David inquired of the Lord, namely through the Urim, whether he should go up to one of the towns of Judah, and if so, to which. He received the reply, "to Hebron," a place peculiarly well adapted for a capital, not only from its situation upon the mountains, and in the centre of the tribe, but also from the sacred reminiscences connected with it from the olden time. David could have no doubt that, now that Saul was dead, he would have to give up his existing connection with the Philistines and return to his own land. But as the Philistines had taken the greater part of the Israelitish territory through their victory at Gilboa, and there was good reason to fear that the adherents of Saul, more especially the army with Abner, Saul's cousin, at its head, would refuse to acknowledge David as king, and consequently a civil war might break out, David would not return to his own land without the express permission of the Lord. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2-4</a>. When he went with his wives and all his retinue (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>) to Hebron and the "cities of Hebron," i.e., the places belonging to the territory of Hebron, the men of Judah came (in the persons of their elders) and anointed him king over the house, i.e., the tribe, of Judah. Just as Saul was made king by the tribes after his anointing by Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>), so David was first of all anointed by Judah here, and afterwards by the rest of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>A new section commences with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;. The first act of David as king was to send messengers to Jabesh, to thank the inhabitants of this city for burying Saul, and to announce to them his own anointing as king. As this expression of thanks involved a solemn recognition of the departed king, by which David divested himself of even the appearance of a rebellion, the announcement of the anointing he had received contained an indirect summons to the Jabeshites to recognise him as their king now. </body></html>
