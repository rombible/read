Asahel Slain.<p>19-32. Asahel pursued after Abner&#8212;To gain the general's armor was deemed the grandest trophy. Asahel, ambitious of securing Abner's, had outstripped all other pursuers, and was fast gaining on the retreating commander. Abner, conscious of possessing more physical power, and unwilling that there should be "blood" between himself and Joab, Asahel's brother, twice urged him to desist. The impetuous young soldier being deaf to the generous remonstrance, the veteran raised the pointed butt of his lance, as the modern Arabs do when pursued, and, with a sudden back thrust, transfixed him on the spot, so that he fell, and lay weltering in his blood. But Joab and Abishai continued the pursuit by another route till sunset. On reaching a rising ground, and receiving a fresh reinforcement of some Benjamites, Abner rallied his scattered troops and earnestly appealed to Joab's better feelings to stop the further effusion of blood, which, if continued, would lead to more serious consequences&#8212;a destructive civil war. Joab, while upbraiding his opponent as the sole cause of the fray, felt the force of the appeal and led off his men; while Abner probably dreading a renewal of the attack when Joab should learn his brother's fate, and vow fierce revenge, endeavored, by a forced march, to cross the Jordan that night. On David's side the loss was only nineteen men, besides Asahel. But of Ish-bosheth's party there fell three hundred and sixty. This skirmish is exactly similar to the battles of the Homeric warriors, among whom, in the flight of one, the pursuit by another, and the dialogue held between them, there is vividly represented the style of ancient warfare.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He was loth to enrage Joab too much against him, because his guilty conscience told him that his cause was bad, and herefore he presaged ill success, and that he might need such a friend as Joab to make his peace with David. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Abner said again to Asahel,.... Being loath to dispatch him: <p>turn thee aside from following me, wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? which was giving him fair warning, and letting him know what he must expect, if he did not desist from his pursuit: <p>how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother? the general of David's army, a stout valiant commander, a man of spirit and resentment, whom Abner knew full well, and that should he slay his brother, he would never be friendly with him, or look pleasantly on him; he would never forgive him, but seek ways and means to avenge his blood on him and by this it seems as if Abner was conscious to himself that he was in a wrong cause, that the kingdom was of right David's, and would be his, and he must be obliged to make peace with him; when he should stand in need of Joab as his friend, which he could not expect, if he slew his brother, nor to live in favour and friendship with him hereafter. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Abner said again to Asahel, Turn thee aside from following me: <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> wherefore should I smite thee to the ground? how then should I hold up my face to Joab thy brother?</span><p>(l) Why do you provoke me to kill you?</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">Turn thee aside</span>] Asahel was probably a mere stripling, and no match for Abner, who, wishing to avoid a feud with Joab and an obstacle to making favourable terms with David on the fall of Saulâ€™s house, again exhorted Asahel to abandon the pursuit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hold up my face to Joab</span>] Meet him with the steady gaze which is the index of a clear conscience, the opposite of the <span class="ital">downcast</span> look which betokens shame and guilt.

"Let the young men arise and wrestle before us." &#1513;&#1474;&#1495;&#1511;, to joke or play, is used here to denote the war-play of single combat. As Joab accepted this proposal, twelve young warriors for Benjamin and Ishbosheth, and twelve from David's men, went over, i.e., went out of the two camps to the appointed scene of conflict; "and one seized the other's head, and his sword was (immediately) in the side of the other (his antagonist), so that they fell together." The clause &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1491; &#1493;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493; is a circumstantial clause: and his sword (every one's sword) was in the side of the other, i.e., thrust into it. Sending the sword into the opponent's side is thus described as simultaneous with the seizure of his head. The ancient translators expressed the meaning by supplying a verb (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;, defixit: lxx, Vulg.). This was a sign that the young men on both sides fought with great ferocity, and also with great courage. The place itself received the name of Helkath-hazzurim, "field of the sharp edges," in consequence (for this use of zur, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-44.htm">Psalm 89:44</a>). </body></html>
