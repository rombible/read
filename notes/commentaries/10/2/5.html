David sent messengers unto the men of Jabesh-gilead&#8212;There can be no doubt that this message of thanks for their bold and dangerous enterprise in rescuing the bodies of Saul and his sons was an expression of David's personal and genuine feeling of satisfaction. At the same time, it was a stroke of sound and timely policy. In this view the announcement of his royal power in Judah, accompanied by the pledge of his protection of the men of Jabesh-gilead, should they be exposed to danger for their adventure at Beth-shan, would bear an important significance in all parts of the country and hold out an assurance that he would render them the same timely and energetic succor that Saul had done at the beginning of his reign.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">This kindness; </span> this respect and affection to procure him burial.

To return them thanks for their courage and boldness in rescuing the bodies of Saul and his sons out of the hands of the Philistines, and for their civility in the burial of them: <p>and said unto them, blessed be ye of the Lord; which may be considered either as a wish, the Lord bless you for it, or as a prediction, the Lord will bless you: <p>that ye have showed this kindness unto your lord, even unto Saul,  <p>and have buried him. To bury the dead, with the Jews, was always reckoned an instance of humanity and kindness, and indeed of piety; an act done in imitation of God (z), who buried Moses, and so it might be expected the divine blessing would attend it. <p>(z) T.

Some suppose that when David was told of their deed, it was with a view of prejudicing him against them. But this is not credible. By this time all men knew how loyal and affectionate were David's feelings towards his former king; and moreover the men of Jabesh were bound to Saul by no ordinary ties of gratitude (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11.htm">1 Samuel 11</a>.). Nor could David wish that Saul's remains, and those of Jonathan, should be subject to indignity. We may well feel sure that information respecting Saul was eagerly welcomed at Hebron, and the valiant men there would all rejoice at finding that the high spirit of the nation was not quenched. But in sending to thank them, in premising to requite them, and in bidding them persevere in similar conduct, David was acting as the head of the nation; and, to justify his action, he informs them that the men of Judah had made him their king. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The second strophe (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>) only applies to the friendship of Jonathan:<p>25  Oh how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!<p>Jonathan (is) slain upon thy heights!<p>26  I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:<p>Thou wast very kind to me:<p>Stranger than the love of woman was thy love to me!<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-25.htm">2 Samuel 1:25</a> is almost a verbal repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-19.htm">2 Samuel 1:19</a>. &#1510;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-26.htm">2 Samuel 1:26</a>) denotes the pinching or pressure of the heart consequent upon pain and mourning. &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1488;&#1514;&#1492;, third pers. fem., like a verb &#1492;&#1500; with the termination lengthened (vid., Ewald, 194, b.), to be wonderful or distinguished. &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1514;&#1498;, thy love to me.
