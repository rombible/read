Abner was therefore the cousin-german of Saul, and had been made by him the commander in chief of his army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-51.htm" title="And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.">1Samuel 14:51</a>). He was thus, both by kindred and office, strongly attached to the house of Saul. He had been with Saul in his pursuit of David, and may have resented David’s address to him on that occasion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_samuel/26-14.htm" title="And David cried to the people, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, Answer you not, Abner? Then Abner answered and said, Who are you that cry to the king?">1Samuel 26:14-16</a>). There is no statement of the time that had elapsed after the death of Saul before Ish-bosheth was set up as king by Abner, but it was probably four or five years, for the following reasons: Ish-bosheth reigned only two years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.">2Samuel 2:10</a>), but David appears to have been acknowledged as king over all Israel soon after his death, and had then reigned over Judah alone seven and a half years. Again, at the death of Saul all the northern part of the country was under the control of the Philistines, and some time must have elapsed before the Israelites would have been in condition to make themselves a new king; and, finally, Ish-bosheth was the youngest of Saul’s sons, born apparently some time after he came to the throne, and he was now forty years old (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-10.htm" title="Ishbosheth Saul's son was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and reigned two years.

These names compounded with Baal may have been originally given, as certainly was the case with Jerubbaal, in consequence of the manful opposition to idolatry of those who bore them, and have been subsequently changed to a compound with “bosheth” (<span class= "ital">shame</span>)<span class= "ital">, </span>in view of the sequel of their histories; or, on the other hand, in the case of Saul’s family the compound with Baal may have been a later name, given in view of their opposition to the divinely appointed king, and to mark God’s utter rejection of the house of Saul.<p><span class= "bld">Mahanaim,</span> famous in the story of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm" title="And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he called the name of that place Mahanaim.">Genesis 32:2</a>), was on the east of the Jordan, and not far from the brook Jabbok.

He knew that Ish-bosheth, if advanced to the sovereignty, would only have the name of a king, while he himself had the power. It appears, however, sufficiently from the sequel of his history, that he was well acquainted with David’s divine designation to the throne; but should he now submit to it he must no more hope for the chief command of the army. Joab was in possession of that under David, and well deserved to be so; and it was not probable he would displace him, a tried friend and a near kinsman, (being the son of Zeruiah, David’s sister,) to make way for an inveterate enemy newly reconciled. Nor was this all; Ish-bosheth was Abner’s near kinsman; whom, if he did not support, the interest of his tribe and of his family must fall with his own. Add to all this, that Abner commanded under Saul in all the expeditions he made against David; and it appears sufficiently from the history that David was greatly an over-match for him in all military conduct. Thus envy, ambition, interest, and personal pique led him to espouse the cause of Ish- bosheth, whom he brought over Jordan with him to Mahanaim, a place in the tribe of Gad, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-26.htm" title="And from Heshbon to Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from Mahanaim to the border of Debir;">Joshua 13:26</a>,) which he chose for his residence, the better to gain that part of the country to his interest, to be more out of the reach of David’s and the Philistines’ incursions, and to have the better opportunity of recruiting his army among a people not only brave and courageous, but well affected to the cause he had espoused.

The nation in general refused David.

David was herein a type of Christ, whom Israel would not submit to, though anointed of the Father to be a Prince and a Saviour to them. Abner meant, Let the young men fight before us, when he said, Let them play before us: fools thus make a mock at sin.

The Hebrews usually changed names ending with Baal into Bosheth ("shame") (compare Jud 9:53 with 2Sa 11:21). This prince was so called from his imbecility.<p>Abner&#8212;was first cousin of Saul, commander of the forces, and held in high respect throughout the country. Loyalty to the house of his late master was mixed up with opposition to David and views of personal ambition in his originating this factious movement. He, too, was alive to the importance of securing the eastern tribes; so, taking Ish-bosheth across the Jordan, he proclaimed him king at Mahanaim, a town on the north bank of the Jabbok, hallowed in patriarchal times by the divine presence (Ge 32:2).

Abner had escaped from the fatal field and carried Ish-bosheth with him across the Jordan, whither it would seem there was a general retreat, while the country west of the Jordan was abandoned to the Philistines (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-7.htm" title="And when the men of Israel that were on the other side of the valley, and they that were on the other side Jordan, saw that the men of Israel fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook the cities, and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelled in them.">1 Samuel 31:7</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ish-bosheth</span>] Saul’s fourth son, not previously mentioned, was a mere tool in the hands of Abner. His original name, as given in the genealogies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish, and Kish begat Saul, and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm" title="And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>, was Esh-baal (= <span class="ital">man of Baal</span>), but this has been changed to Ish-bosheth (= <span class="ital">man of shame</span>), to avoid the scandal of pronouncing the name of the false god Baal.

Afterwards it became the retreat of David when he fled from Absalom (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm" title="Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom passed over Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him.">2 Samuel 17:24</a>), and at that time was a fortified town with walls and gates (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2 Samuel 18:24</a>).

This hero had been present at the battle of Gilboa, and probably had rallied many of the defeated Israelites, and made as much resistance as was possible to the onward march of the Philistines. And as soon as he had effected his retreat into the region beyond the Jordan, his power would be supreme. There was no one there to oppose the commander-in-chief of what remained of Saul's army. Certainly all that remained of Saul's body guard of three thousand men would gather round Abner, and as the Philistines did not push their pursuit further than the Jordan, he was free to do as he chose. Nor would there be any opposition. Abner was bound to do his best for Saul's family, and the people would feel this, and approve of his conduct in standing up for the children of their king. Moreover, David by his conduct had made himself an object of suspicion to all the valiant men who had formed Saul's army, and these would be the more embittered against him by their defeat. <span class="cmt_word">Ishbosheth</span>. This name signifies "man of shame," that is, "man of the shameful thing," the idol. Originally he was named Eshbaal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-33.htm">1 Chronicles 8:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/9-39.htm">1 Chronicles 9:39</a>), that is "man of Baal," the word <span class="accented">esh</span> being merely a dialectic variation for <span class="accented">ish</span>, equivalent to "man." At this early date Baal was not the specific name of any idol, but simply meant "lord," "master," "husband." In the earlier books of the Bible we find the word used of many local deities, who were lords of this or that, but had nothing in common with the Phoenician Baal, whose worship Ahab attempted to introduce into Israel. From that time Baal became a term of reproach, and Bosheth, "the shame," was substituted for it in the old names of which it had formed part. Thus Gideon is still called Jerubbaal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-11.htm">1 Samuel 12:11</a>, but the title is transformed into Jerubbesheth, or more correctly, Jerubbosheth, "let the shame plead," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-21.htm">2 Samuel 11:21</a>. Originally, therefore, the name Ishbaal had no discreditable meaning, but signified, "man of the Lord," or, as Ewald supposes, "lordly man." It was not till long afterwards, when Israel had been horrified by Jezebel's doings, that Baal, except in the sense of "husband," became an ill-omened word. Jonathan, whose own name, "Jehovah's gift," in Greek Theodore, is proof sufficient that Saul's family were worshippers of the true God, called his son's name Meribbaal, "the Lord's strife" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-34.htm">1 Chronicles 8:34</a>). In some strange way this was altered into Mephibosheth, that is, "from the face of the shameful thing" (ch. 2 Samuel 4:4. etc.). Possibly it is a corruption of Meribbosheth, but it is remarkable that a son of Saul by his concubine Rizpah also bore the name (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a>). Among the ancestors of Saul, the simple name Baal, "Lord," occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-30.htm">1 Chronicles 8:30</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Mahanaim</span>. Abner chose this town because it was on the eastern side of the Jordan, and so beyond the range of the Philistines, who never seem to have crossed the river. It was situated on the borders of the tribe of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, from both of which valiant warriors had joined David; but the people generally were not ill affected to the house of Saul. As having been assigned to the Levites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-38.htm">Joshua 21:38</a>), it had a quasi-religious character, inherited from the vision of angels seen there by Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2</a>). As a safe, out of the way place, David subsequently took refuge there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-24.htm">2 Samuel 17:24</a>).

"After this," i.e., after the facts related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1.htm">2 Samuel 1</a>, David inquired of the Lord, namely through the Urim, whether he should go up to one of the towns of Judah, and if so, to which. He received the reply, "to Hebron," a place peculiarly well adapted for a capital, not only from its situation upon the mountains, and in the centre of the tribe, but also from the sacred reminiscences connected with it from the olden time. David could have no doubt that, now that Saul was dead, he would have to give up his existing connection with the Philistines and return to his own land. But as the Philistines had taken the greater part of the Israelitish territory through their victory at Gilboa, and there was good reason to fear that the adherents of Saul, more especially the army with Abner, Saul's cousin, at its head, would refuse to acknowledge David as king, and consequently a civil war might break out, David would not return to his own land without the express permission of the Lord. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-2.htm">2 Samuel 1:2-4</a>. When he went with his wives and all his retinue (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/27-2.htm">1 Samuel 27:2</a>) to Hebron and the "cities of Hebron," i.e., the places belonging to the territory of Hebron, the men of Judah came (in the persons of their elders) and anointed him king over the house, i.e., the tribe, of Judah. Just as Saul was made king by the tribes after his anointing by Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-15.htm">1 Samuel 11:15</a>), so David was first of all anointed by Judah here, and afterwards by the rest of the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-3.htm">2 Samuel 5:3</a>).<p>A new section commences with &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;. The first act of David as king was to send messengers to Jabesh, to thank the inhabitants of this city for burying Saul, and to announce to them his own anointing as king. As this expression of thanks involved a solemn recognition of the departed king, by which David divested himself of even the appearance of a rebellion, the announcement of the anointing he had received contained an indirect summons to the Jabeshites to recognise him as their king now. </body></html>
