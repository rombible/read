He caused him to drink more than was proper. What mean and shameful contrivances did David employ against this brave man! How base is sin, how low it will make men stoop, and what vile and unworthy things it will induce them to do! This was a great addition, to David’s sin, that by one evil he endeavoured to effect another; by intoxicating Uriah he strove to make him forget his oath before mentioned.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>11:6-13 Giving way to sin hardens the heart, and provokes the departure of the Holy Spirit.

But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house&#8212;It is customary for servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure, and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety (2Sa 11:11). But, doubtless, the resolution of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil, and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/11.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David said to Uriah, tarry here today also,....

This was probably the pretext under which David had had him sent to him. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>, Uriah was one of the gibborim ("mighty men") of David, and therefore held some post of command in the army, although there is no historical foundation for the statement made by Josephus, viz., that he was Joab's armour-bearer or aide-de-camp. The king then said to him, "Go down to thy house (from the palace upon Mount Zion down to the lower city, where Uriah's house was situated), and wash thy feet;" and when he had gone out of the palace, he sent a royal present after him. The Israelites were accustomed to wash their feet when they returned home from work or from a journey, to take refreshment and rest themselves. Consequently these words contained an intimation that he was to go and refresh himself in his own home. David's wish was that Uriah should spend a night at home with his wife, that he might afterwards be regarded as the father of the child that had been begotten in adultery. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, a present, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-18.htm">Esther 2:18</a>.</body></html>
