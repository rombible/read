It is quite unnecessary to suppose that Uriah had any suspicion of what had been done.

But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house&#8212;It is customary for servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure, and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety (2Sa 11:11). But, doubtless, the resolution of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil, and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">With all the servants of his lord; </span> with the king’s guard.

The bodyguards, which were placed there to watch the palace in the night season; Uriah first fell into a conversation with these as is highly probable, to whom he was well known, and who might inquire of one and another of their friends in the army; and he being weary, laid himself down among there, and slept: <p>and went not down to his house; whether the trifling questions David asked him, or the information the guards might give him of his wife being sent for to court; made him suspect something, and so had no inclination to go to this own house; or however so it was ordered by the providence of God, which directed him to act in this manner, that the sin of David and Bathsheba they studied to hide might be discovered. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/11.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and went not down to his house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/11.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Uriah slept at the door of the king’s house</span>] Probably in the guard chamber in the outer court.

Instead of Bathsheba the daughter of Eliam, we find the name given in the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-5.htm">1 Chronicles 3:5</a>) as Bathshua the daughter of Ammiel. The form &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506; may be derived from &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1506;, in which &#1489; is softened into ; for Bathsheba (with beth) is the correct and original form, as we may see from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-11.htm">1 Kings 1:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-15.htm">1 Kings 1:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-28.htm">1 Kings 1:28</a>. Eliam and Ammiel have the same signification; the difference simply consists in the transposition of the component parts of the name. It is impossible to determine, however, which of the two forms was the original one.</body></html>
