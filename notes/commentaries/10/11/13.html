But Uriah slept at the door of the king's house&#8212;It is customary for servants to sleep in the porch or long gallery; and the guards of the Hebrew king did the same. Whatever his secret suspicions might have been, Uriah's refusal to indulge in the enjoyment of domestic pleasure, and his determination to sleep "at the door of the king's house," arose from a high and honorable sense of military duty and propriety (2Sa 11:11). But, doubtless, the resolution of Uriah was overruled by that Providence which brings good out of evil, and which has recorded this sad episode for the warning of the church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/11.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">When David had called him, </span> i.e. being invited by David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He made him drunk, </span> or, <span class="ital">he made him merry</span>, as the word oft signifies.

But this plan also failed. “The Providence of God is here manifest, defeating David’s base contrivances, and bringing his sin to the open light. It is no less clear how mercy was at the bottom of this severity which issued in David’s deep repentance, and has also given to the Church one of the most solemn and searching warnings as to the evil of sin which is contained in the whole Bible.” <span class="ital">Speaker’s Comm</span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/11.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">He made him drunk.</span> David thus adds sin to sin, and, in order to accomplish his vile end, he degrades the brave soldier whom already he had dishonoured. But even when intoxicated Uriah kept to his determination; and though on this second night there would not be the same pleasure in chatting with old comrades seen again after long absence, he still sleeps in the guard room. And thus there were witnesses that he had not gone to his house. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David had Uriah the husband of Bathsheba sent to him by Joab, under whom he was serving in the army before Rabbah, upon some pretext or other, and asked him as soon as he arrived how it fared with Joab and the people (i.e., the army) and the war. This was probably the pretext under which David had had him sent to him. According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-39.htm">2 Samuel 23:39</a>, Uriah was one of the gibborim ("mighty men") of David, and therefore held some post of command in the army, although there is no historical foundation for the statement made by Josephus, viz., that he was Joab's armour-bearer or aide-de-camp. The king then said to him, "Go down to thy house (from the palace upon Mount Zion down to the lower city, where Uriah's house was situated), and wash thy feet;" and when he had gone out of the palace, he sent a royal present after him. The Israelites were accustomed to wash their feet when they returned home from work or from a journey, to take refreshment and rest themselves. Consequently these words contained an intimation that he was to go and refresh himself in his own home. David's wish was that Uriah should spend a night at home with his wife, that he might afterwards be regarded as the father of the child that had been begotten in adultery. &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514;, a present, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-11.htm">Amos 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-4.htm">Jeremiah 50:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/esther/2-18.htm">Esther 2:18</a>.</body></html>
