David had evidently hurried his campaign against Hadarezer to prevent the junction of his foes, and Joab had probably been sent at first with only a small force to hold the Ammonites in check. With the speedy and successful close of David’s own operations, he returned to Jerusalem, while the bulk of the army was sent to join Joab.

It consisted of the lower town, called “the city of waters” (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-27.htm" title="And Joab sent messengers to David, and said, I have fought against Rabbah, and have taken the city of waters.">2 Samuel 12:27</a>), from the perennial stream which has its source in it; and the citadel, a place of great strength, built on a hill rising abruptly on the north side of the lower town (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/12-28.htm" title="Now therefore gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it: lest I take the city, and it be called after my name....">2 Samuel 12:28-29</a>).

It seems quite certain that the war with Hadarezer did not take place in the same year as the defeat of the Syrians at Medeba. For the gathering of his mercenaries by Nahash would occupy a long time, and it was done so leisurely, that not only did news of it reach Jerusalem, but David was able to collect his forces, and instead of awaiting the invasion, could deliver his attack on the enemy's ground. The battle at Medeba took place in the autumn, and, as it was impossible to keep the field with winter so near, Joab marched back to Jerusalem, intending in the spring to return to the siege of Rabbah. But David quickly had information that a more serious war was impending, and, instead of sending Joab, he now gathers "all Israel," and, after gaining a victory, it is plain that he marched into the Syrian territories, and compelled by his presence the allies of Hadarezer to transfer their allegiance to him. Simultaneously with this war he had to meet the attack of the Edomites, for which purpose he detached Abishai with a portion of his army; and it was necessary also to post garrisons in their country, and in Atom of Damascus. It was while he was thus occupied in the Aramean states that he gathered the "much brass" spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-8.htm">2 Samuel 8:8</a>. The Ammonites would necessarily be left to themselves while these great events were going on, but now, after a respite of a year and a half, David <span class="cmt_word">sent Joab, and his servants,</span> that is, his officers - the word "servant" in Oriental courts being constantly used to designate those, high in rank near the king's person - <span class="cmt_word">and all Israel;</span> that is, an army gathered from all the tribes. In accordance with the cruel customs of ancient warfare, they began by laying the whole country waste, and putting all whom they found to the sword, and thus <span class="cmt_word">destroyed the children of Ammon</span> before laying siege to the capital, into which all the people by these harsh measures had been forced to go for refuge. In the Hebrew there is a curious spelling, the word "kings" being written <span class="accented">melakim</span>, with an <span class="accented">aleph</span> to represent the long a. It is a mistake to suppose that a different word, <span class="accented">malakim</span>, "angels" or "ambassadors," is meant, as it is nothing more than an archaic method of spelling, instances of which have been made rare by the extreme fastidiousness of Hebrew scribes.
