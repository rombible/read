It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

There are thirty-one mentioned in the list, including Asahel; and these added to the two superior orders make thirty-seven. Two of them, we know, were already dead; namely, Asahel [2Sa 3:30] and Uriah [2Sa 11:17]; and if the dead, at the drawing up of the list, amounted to seven, then we might suppose a legion of honor, consisting of the definite number thirty, where the vacancies, when they occurred, were replaced by fresh appointments.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">One of the thirty; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">with</span> or <span class="ital">among the thirty</span>; not only as one, but as the chief of them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty,....

In all probability both lists have suffered considerably from textual corruption, by which names are especially liable to be affected, and many of the differences can clearly be traced to this source. But it cannot be assumed as absolutely certain that the lists were originally identical.

This arrangement of men in tens, with an officer over them. was, in fact, the normal rule among the Hebrews. The second triad is  unusual, but is explained by the history. In honour of the exploit of bringing the water from the well of Bethlehem, this second order of three was instituted, lower than the three chiefs, but higher than the rest. The third of these is not mentioned, and the disappearance of the name is not the result of accident, but of purpose. Had it been a scribe's error, there would have been some trace of it in the versions. But if the name was erased, it must have been blotted out for treason, and we thus have two candidates for the vacant niche: one is Amasa, and the other Ahithophel. The name of Joab we cannot for one moment admit. He never was a traitor to David, nor would the latter, though king, have ventured to degrade one so powerful, and who continued to be commander-in-chief until David's death. Now, if Amasa is the same as the Amasai in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-18.htm">1 Chronicles 12:18</a>, who was chief of the captains who came from Judah and Benjamin to David when he was in the hold, it is difficult to account for the absence of his name from the list of the thirty. Plainly, however, David did not regard his treason with strong displeasure, but was prepared, after Absalom's death, to make him commander-in-chief. But we must remember that a place in this second triad was gained by one exploit. The three were those who broke through the Philistine host, and fetched the water from Bethlehem. Such a deed would account for the close attachment between David and Ahithophel. He was the king's companion, and his familiar friend. It would account also for his suicide. His love to David had, for some unknown reason, turned to bitter hatred. He sought, not only David's life, but his dishonour. His feelings must have been highly excited before he could have worked himself up to such a pitch; and the reaction and disappointment would be equally extreme. He never could have faced David again, remembering the warmth of former love, and the shamelessness with which he had sought, not only his life, but to bring upon him public shame and ignominy. And his name would have been totally erased, and gone down into silence. Of Ahithophel's personal accomplishments as a brave warrior, we cannot doubt (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-1.htm">2 Samuel 17:1</a>), and his son Eliam was one of the mighties.

Abishai, Joab's brother (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-6.htm">1 Samuel 26:6</a>), was also chief of the body-guard, like Jashobeam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a> : the Chethib &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; is correct; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm">2 Samuel 23:8</a>). He swung his spear over three hundred slain. "He had a name among the three," i.e., the three principal heroes, Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah. The following words, &#1502;&#1503;&#1470;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, make no sense. &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is an error in writing for &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a> shows in both the texts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-25.htm">2 Samuel 23:25</a> of the Chronicles): an error the origin of which may easily be explained from the word &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, which stands immediately before. "He was certainly honoured before the thirty (heroes of David), and became their chief, but he did not come to the three," i.e., he was not equal to Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497; has the force of an energetic assurance: "Is it so that," i.e., it is certainly so (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-1.htm">2 Samuel 9:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/29-15.htm">Genesis 29:15</a>).</body></html>
