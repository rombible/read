It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Benaiah the son of Jehoiada - He commanded the Cherethites and Pelethites all through David's reign <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-23.htm">2 Samuel 20:23</a>, and took a prominent part in supporting Solomon against Adonijah when David was dying, and was rewarded by being made captain of the host in the room of Joab <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-8.htm">1 Kings 1:8</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-26.htm">1 Kings 1:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-32.htm">1 Kings 1:32-40</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-25.htm">1 Kings 2:25-35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-4.htm">1 Kings 4:4</a>.

Instances occur among Arabs and Persians of the surname "lion of God" being given to great warriors. Hence, it is supposed that the same custom prevailed among the Moabites. But the Vulgate has "two lions of Moab," which seems to be borne out by the next sentence.<p>Slew a lion ... - Rather, THE lion, one of those described above as "a lion of God," if the Vulgate Version is right. Apparently in a severe winter a lion had come up from its usual haunts to some village in search of food, and taken possession of the tank or cistern to the terror of the inhabitants, and Benaiah attacked it boldly and killed it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19-39. the first three&#8212;The mighty men or champions in David's military staff were divided into three classes&#8212;the highest, Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah; the second class, Abishai, Benaiah, and Asahel; and the third class, the thirty, of which Asahel was the chief. There are thirty-one mentioned in the list, including Asahel; and these added to the two superior orders make thirty-seven. Two of them, we know, were already dead; namely, Asahel [2Sa 3:30] and Uriah [2Sa 11:17]; and if the dead, at the drawing up of the list, amounted to seven, then we might suppose a legion of honor, consisting of the definite number thirty, where the vacancies, when they occurred, were replaced by fresh appointments.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada,....

He would not drink it, however, but poured it out upon the ground to the Lord, as a drink-offering for Jehovah. "He poured it out upon the earth, rendering Him thanks for the return of the three brave men" (Clericus). And he said, "Far be it from me, O Jehovah, to do this! The blood of the men who went with their lives (i.e., at the risk of their lives)," sc., should I drink it? The verb &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is wanting in our text, but is not to be inserted according to the Chronicles as though it had fallen out; the sentence is rather to be regarded as an aposiopesis. &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; after &#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; is a vocative, and is not to be altered into &#1502;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; according to the &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497; of the Chronicles. The fact that the vocative does not occur in other passages after &#1500;&#1497; &#1495;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; proves nothing. It is equivalent to the oath &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1495;&#1497;   (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/14-45.htm">1 Samuel 14:45</a>). The chronicler has endeavoured to simplify David's exclamation by completing the sentence. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, "for the price of their souls," i.e., at the risk of their lives. The water drawn and fetched at the risk of their lives is compared to the soul itself, and the soul is in the blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-11.htm">Leviticus 17:11</a>). Drinking this water, therefore, would be nothing else than drinking their blood.</body></html>
