The list in Chronicles is given in connection with David’s becoming king over all Israel; but in both cases the list is not to be understood as belonging precisely to any definite time, but rather as a catalogue of the chief heroes who distinguished themselves at any time in the life of David.<p><span class= "bld">The Tachmonite that sat in the seat.</span>—The text of this verse has undergone several alterations, which may be corrected by the parallel passage in Chronicles.

Jashobeam came to David at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm" title="Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.">1Chronicles 12:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-6.htm" title="Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam, the Korhites,">1Chronicles 12:6</a>), and afterwards became the general of the first division of the army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm" title="Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.">1Chronicles 27:2</a>), being immediately followed by Dodo. One of the same family was tutor to David’s sons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-32.htm" title="Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counselor, a wise man, and a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's sons:">1Chronicles 27:32</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The captains.</span>—The word for <span class= "ital">captain </span>and the word for <span class= "ital">three </span>are much alike, and the text here and in Chronicles perpetually fluctuates between the two.

And he lifted up his spear against three hundred, and slew them, and had the name among three.">2Samuel 23:18</a>. Variations in numbers are exceedingly common, but the probability is in favour of the correctness of the text here. This large number was slain by Jashobeam and the men under his command in one combat.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-8.htm" title="These be the names of the mighty men whom David had: The Tachmonite that sat in the seat, chief among the captains; the same was Adino the Eznite: he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time.">2 Samuel 23:8</a></span>. <span class="ital">These be the names of the mighty men whom David had — </span>Who helped to raise David to his dignity, and to preserve him in it, being continually with him in all his wars. There is a list of them also 1 Chronicles 11., different from this in several particulars. But Abarbinel thinks this creates no difficulty, if we do but observe that there he distinguishes them into three classes. Those that had always been with him; those that came to him at Ziklag, a little before he was made king of Judah; and those that came to him in Hebron, after he was made king of all Israel. It was proper that the memories of all these should be preserved. But here, in this book, the writer intended only to mention the most excellent of his heroes, who were always with him in his wars; and for whose sake he composed the preceding song of praise to God. Add to this, that this catalogue, though placed here, was taken long before many of the preceding events, as is manifest from hence, that Asahel and Uriah are named in it. It must be observed also, that it was very common for one person to have divers names, and that as some of the worthies died, and others arose in their stead, a great alteration must of course take place in the latter catalogue from the former. We may learn from hence, how much religion tends to inspire men with true courage. David, both by his writings and example, greatly promoted piety among the grandees of his kingdom. And when they became famous for piety, they became famous for bravery.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">The Tachmonite that sat in the seat — </span>He sat in the counsel of war, next to Joab, being, it is thought, his lieutenant-general. <span class="ital">Chief among the captains </span>— The principal commander after Joab. <span class="ital">The same was Adino — </span>This was his proper name, and he probably was of the family of the Eznites. <span class="ital">He lifted up his spear — </span>These words are properly supplied out of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm" title="And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had; Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, where they are expressed. <span class="ital">Against eight hundred — </span>In the above-mentioned place of 1 Chronicles it is only <span class="ital">three hundred.

It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The duplicate of this passage is in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11.htm">1 Chronicles 11</a>, where it is in immediate connection with David's accession to the throne of Israel, and where the mighty men are named as those by whose aid David was made king. The document belongs to the early part of David's reign.

A Catalogue of His Mighty Men.<p>8. These be the names of the mighty men whom David had&#8212;This verse should be translated thus: He who sits in the seat of the Tachmonite (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of the mighty men whom David had, </span> i. e. of his chief and most valiant commanders.

And whereas there are some differences between this list and that <span class="bld"> 1Ch 11</span>, most of them are easily reconciled by these two considerations: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. That nothing is more common than for one person to have divers names. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2.

Some of the Hebrew writers affirm that these were two distinct persons, being called by differing names; the one the father, and the other the son, who succeeded his father, as in strength and valour, so also in his place of honour and trust. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These be the names of the mighty men whom David had,.... Besides Joab his general, who is not mentioned; for these were all military men under him, which are distinguished into three classes; the first and highest consisted of three only, who were general officers; and the second also of three, who perhaps were colonels of regiments; and the third of thirty, who were captains of thousands and hundreds: <p>the Tachmonite that sat in the seat, the chief among the captains: not in the chief seat in the sanhedrim, and was the head of that, and so had the name of Tachmonite, from his wisdom, as the Jewish writers say; but in the council of war, where he presided under the general, or in his absence, and was, perhaps, lieutenant general, and so over all the captains; and therefore was neither David nor Joab, to whom some of the Rabbins apply these words, as observed by Kimchi; or rather he was the chief of the three to whom he belonged; his name, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, or the son of an Hachmonite, the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>; and here it may be as well read Josheb-bashebeth the Tachmonite, the same name, with a little variation; which seem to be names given him, taken from his character and office; for his proper name was as follows: <p>the same was Adino the Eznite: so called either from the family he was of, or from the place of his birth; though a learned man thinks it should be read as in the following supplement (q): <p>he lifted up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time; which, though a very extraordinary exploit, yet not more strange, or so strange as that of Shamgar's slaying six hundred men with an ox goad, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-31.htm">Judges 3:31</a>, or as that of Samson's killing a thousand men with the jawbone of an ass, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/15-15.htm">Judges 15:15</a>, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, the number is only three hundred, which some attempt to reconcile by observing, that not the same person is meant in both places; here he is called Joshebbashebeth, there Jashobeam; here the Tachmonite, there the son of an Hachmonite; nor is he there called Adino the Eznite; but yet it seems plain that in both places the chief of the three worthies of David is meant, and so the same man: others observe, that he engaged with eight hundred, and slew three hundred of them, when the rest fled, and were pursued and killed by his men; and he routing them, and being the occasion of their being slain, the slaying of them all is ascribed to him; or he first slew three hundred, and five hundred more coming upon him, he slew them also: but what Kimchi offers seems to be best, that there were two battles, in which this officer was engaged; at one of them he slew eight hundred, and at the other three hundred; for so what is omitted in the books of Samuel, and of the Kings, is frequently supplied in the books of Chronicles, as what one evangelist in the New Testament omits, another records. The above learned writer (r) conjectures, that being the first letter of the words for three and eight, and the numeral letter being here reduced to its word at length, through a mistake in the copier, was written  "eight", instead of  "three": the Septuagint version is,"he drew out his spear against eight hundred soldiers at once,''and says nothing of slaying them; and seems to be the true sense of the word, as the same learned writer (s) has abundantly shown. <p>(q) Kennicott's Dissert. 1. so Hillerus in Onomastic.

It is given there in connection with David's elevation to the throne of all Israel, and the conquest of Jerusalem. Such catalogues might possibly be revised from time to time, and new names inserted as there were vacancies caused by death. And this seems to have been the case with the list in Chronicles, which contains the names of all who were admitted during David's reign into the order of the mighties. The present is the actual list of the order as it existed on the day when David, at Hebron, was anointed king over all the twelve tribes. And we can well conceive that, on so grand an occasion, David founded this, the first order of chivalry, and gave his thirty knights, as they would be now called, their special rank and high privileges. <span class="cmt_word">The Tachmonite.</span> This verse is extremely corrupt. A man could not be a Tachmonite and an Eznite at the same time. In the Revised Version the corruption is confessed in the mildest terms, but there is something painfully ludicrous in giving Josheb-basshebeth as the man's name. The reading "Jashobeam the son of a Hachmonite," in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-11.htm">1 Chronicles 11:11</a>, is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-6.htm">1 Chronicles 12:6</a>, where Jashobeam is mentioned among those who joined David at Ziklag, and by <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/27-2.htm">1 Chronicles 27:2</a>, where we find him appointed commander of the first brigade of twenty-four thousand men. The error in the present text arose from the scribe's eye being misled by catching sight of <span class="accented">basshebeth</span> in the line above, it being the word translated "in the same place" in the Authorized Version. <span class="cmt_word">He Adino the Eznite.</span> These unmeaning words are a corruption of the right reading preserved in Chronicles, "he lifted up his spear." The number of men whom he slew at one time is there stated as having been three hundred; but, as Abishai accomplished this feat, and yet held only inferior rank, eight hundred is probably right. And possibly it is not meant that he slew them all with his own hand, though that is quite possible. He was <span class="cmt_word">chief of the captains.</span> The word for "captain," <span class="accented">shalish</span>, is derived from the numeral "three;" and probably it was the title of the three who formed the first rank of the mighties. But in course of time it seems to have been applied to the commanders of the body guard (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-25.htm">2 Kings 10:25</a>); and we find Bidcar so styled when in personal attendance upon Jehu (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-25.htm">2 Kings 9:25</a>); and Pekah used the opportunities afforded by this office for the murder of Pekahiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-25.htm">2 Kings 15:25</a>). It is not used of military officers generally. Those admitted to the list were evidently the outlaws . who had been with David in his wanderings and at Ziklag. They now received their reward, and became, moreover, the stay of David's throne. It is their past history which accounts for the strange composition of the list. A large number came from Judah, and especially from Bethlehem. Several are David's own relatives. Seven towns or families furnish sixteen out of the whole list. We find a father and his son, and pairs of brothers. There are, moreover, numerous foreigners - Hittites, Ammonites, Moabites, a Syrian from Zobah, and Gideonites, descended from the aboriginal inhabitants of the land. Such a list would have been sorely resented had it not been formed out of men who had earned it by their past services and their fidelity to David. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Divine saying of David the son of Jesse,<p>Divine saying of the man, the highly exalted,<p>Of the anointed of the God of Jacob,<p>And of the lovely one in the songs of praise of Israel.<p>  2  The Spirit of Jehovah speaks through me,<p>And His word is upon my tongue.<p>This introduction to the prophetic announcement rests, both as to form and substance, upon the last sayings of Balaam concerning the future history of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>). This not only shows to what extent David had occupied himself with the utterances of the earlier men of God concerning Israel's future; but indicates, at the same time, that his own prophetic utterance was intended to be a further expansion of Balaam's prophecy concerning the Star out of Jacob and the Sceptre out of Israel. Like Balaam, he calls his prophecy a &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, i.e., a divine saying or oracle, as a revelation which he had received directly from God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>). But the recipient of this revelation was not, like Balaam the son of Beor, a man with closed eye, whose eyes had been opened by a vision of the Almighty, but "the man who was raised up on high" (&#1506;&#1500;, adverbially "above," is, strictly speaking, a substantive, "height," used in an adverbial sense, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, and probably also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), i.e., whom God had lifted up out of humiliation to be the ruler of His people, yea, even to be the head of the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>). Luther's rendering, "who is assured of the Messiah of the God of Jacob," is based upon the Vulgate, "cui constitutum est de Christo Dei Jacob," and cannot be grammatically sustained. David was exalted on the one hand as "the anointed of the God of Jacob," i.e., as the one whom the God of Israel had anointed king over His people, and on the other hand as "the lovely one in Israel's songs of praise," i.e., the man whom God had enabled to sing lovely songs of praise in celebration of His grace and glory. &#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; does not mean a song generally, but a song of praise in honour of God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>), like &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; in the headings to the psalms. As David on the one hand had firmly established the kingdom of God in an earthly and political respect as the anointed of Jehovah, i.e., as king, so had he on the other, as the composer of Israel's songs of praise, promoted the spiritual edification of that kingdom. The idea of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>. The Spirit of Jehovah speaks through him; his words are the inspiration of God. The preterite &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; relates to the divine inspiration which preceded the utterance of the divine saying. &#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, literally to speak into a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>. The saying itself commences with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>.</body></html>
