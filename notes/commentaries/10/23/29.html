It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

There are thirty-one mentioned in the list, including Asahel; and these added to the two superior orders make thirty-seven. Two of them, we know, were already dead; namely, Asahel [2Sa 3:30] and Uriah [2Sa 11:17]; and if the dead, at the drawing up of the list, amounted to seven, then we might suppose a legion of honor, consisting of the definite number thirty, where the vacancies, when they occurred, were replaced by fresh appointments.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Heleb the son of Baanah, a Netophathite,....

He was the son of a brave man, rich in deeds (&#1495;&#1497; is evidently an error for &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; in the Chronicles), of Kabzeel in the south of Judah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-21.htm">Joshua 15:21</a>). "He smote the two Ariels of Moab." The Arabs and Persians call every remarkably brave man Ariel, or lion of God (vid., Bochart, Hieroz. ii. pp. 7, 63). They were therefore two celebrated Moabitish heroes. The supposition that they were sons of the king of the Moabites is merely founded upon the conjecture of Thenius and Bertheau, that the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; (sons of) has dropped out before Ariel. "He also slew the lion in the well on the day of the snow," i.e., a lion which had been driven into the neighbourhood of human habitations by a heavy fall of snow, and had taken refuge in a cistern. The Chethib &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512; are the earlier forms for the Keris substituted by the Masoretes &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; and &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;, and consequently are not to be altered. He also slew an Egyptian of distinguished size. According to the Keri we should read &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; (instead of &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492; fo daetsni( &#1488; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;), "a man of appearance," i.e., a distinguished man, or a man of great size, &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd; (lxx); in the Chronicles it is simplified as &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, a man of measure, i.e., of great height. This man was armed with a spear or javelin, whereas Benaiah was only armed with a stick; nevertheless the latter smote him, took away his spear, and slew him with his own weapon. According to the Chronicles the Egyptian was five cubits high, and his spear like a weaver's beam. Through these feats Benaiah acquired a name among the three, though he did not equal them (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-22.htm">2 Samuel 23:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-23.htm">2 Samuel 23:23</a>, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-18.htm">2 Samuel 23:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-19.htm">2 Samuel 23:19</a>); and David made him a member of his privy council (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-14.htm">1 Samuel 22:14</a>).</body></html>
