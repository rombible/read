These are not the same three (since there is no definite article) with those just mentioned, but were another three more eminent than the rest of the thirty, two of them being, no doubt, Abishai and Benaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-18.htm" title="And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, was chief among three.

It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

These be the names of the mighty men whom David had&#8212;This verse should be translated thus: He who sits in the seat of the Tachmonite (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Three of the thirty; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The absence of the article shows that these three were not Jashobeam, Eleazar, and Shammah, but probably Abishai, Be-naiah, and another whose name and exploits have been purposely omitted both here and in Chronicles. Apparently this narrative, so interesting as showing the fascination which David exercised over his men, is given as having led to the institution of this second order of three in the brotherhood of the mighties. <span class="cmt_word">In the harvest time.</span> The Hebrew is "to harvest," but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-15.htm">1 Chronicles 11:15</a> "to the rock." As the preposition used here cannot mean "in," this is probably the right reading. In this case, also, it is the similarity of the words that has led to the con. fusion. Is it possible that these lists were taken from very old and worn catalogues, which it was very difficult to decipher? <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  6  But the worthless, as rejected thorns are they all;<p>For men do not take them in the hand.<p>  7  And the man who touches them<p>Provides himself with iron and spear-shaft,<p>And they are utterly burned with fire where they dwell.<p>The development of salvation under the ruler in righteousness and the fear of God is accompanied by judgment upon the ungodly.

This epithet does not apply to the thorns, so well as to the ungodly who are compared to thorns. The reference is to thorns that men root out, not to those which they avoid on account of their prickles. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1501;, an antiquated form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; (see Ewald, 247, d.). To root them out, or clean the ground of them, men do not lay hold of them with the bare hand; but "whoever would touch them equips himself (&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;, sc., &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, to 'fill the hand' with anything: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-24.htm">2 Kings 9:24</a>) with iron, i.e., with iron weapons, and spear-shaft" (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>). This expression also relates to the godless rather than to the thorns. They are consumed &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;, "at the dwelling," i.e., as Kimchi explains, at the place of their dwelling, the place where they grow. For &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514; cannot mean "on the spot" in the sense of without delay. The burning of the thorns takes place at the final judgment upon the ungodly (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-30.htm">Matthew 13:30</a>). </body></html>
