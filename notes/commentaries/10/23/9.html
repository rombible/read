The name is the same under slightly differing forms. “Ahohite” is a patronymic derived from Ahoah, son of Bela, Benjamin’s son (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,">1Chronicles 8:4</a>).<p><span class= "bld">When they defied . . . there gathered.</span>—The words “there gathered” require the mention of some place, and the construction of the word for “defied” is unusual. The parallel passage in Chronicles reads, “He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines,” &c. The difference between the two readings is not great in the original, and the latter is better. Pas-dammim is the Ephes-dammim of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1Samuel 17:1</a>, where Goliath defied the armies of Israel, and was slain by David.<p><span class= "bld">Were gone away</span>—Rather, were <span class= "ital">gathered </span>to battle. So it is translated in the LXX., Vulg., and Syriac, and so the Hebrew requires. The error is a curious one, and seems to have arisen in this way: In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1Chronicles 11:13</a> the mention of the battle in which Shammah was engaged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm" title="And after him was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. And the Philistines were gathered together into a troop, where was a piece of ground full of lentils: and the people fled from the Philistines.">2Samuel 23:11</a>) is altogether omitted, and the expression “the people fled from before the Philistines” therefore becomes connected with this battle. Josephus follows that text, and our translators were probably misled by him. Several lines have dropped out from the text in Chronicles.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/23.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/23-9.htm" title="And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the Ahohite, one of the three mighty men with David, when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle, and the men of Israel were gone away:...">2 Samuel 23:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">The men of Israel were gone away </span>— Had fled from before the Philistines, as it is explained, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>, being dismayed at the sight of them. <span class="ital">And his hand clave unto the sword — </span>Being all besmeared with blood. <span class="ital">The Lord wrought a great victory that day — </span>Like that of Shamgar and of Samson; God inspiring him with wonderful courage, and striking a terror into the Philistines. <span class="ital">The people returned after him only to spoil — </span>They that had fled, rallied again when they saw the wonders he did; and followed after him, not to fight, but only to partake of the spoil.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>23:8-39 David once earnestly longed for the water at the well of Bethlehem. It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood?

These words and what follows as far as "troop" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-11.htm">2 Samuel 23:11</a> have fallen out of the text in Chronicles. The effect of this is to omit EIeazar's feat, as here described, to attribute to him Shammah's victory, to misplace the flight of the Israelites, and to omit Shammah altogether from the list of David's mighty men. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 23:8-39.

The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Ahohite; </span> of the children of <span class="ital">Ahoah</span>, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/8-4.htm" title="And Abishua, and Naaman, and Ahoah,">1 Chronicles 8:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">One of the three, </span> i. e. one of the first three, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-19.htm" title="Was he not most honorable of three? therefore he was their captain: however, he attained not to the first three.">2 Samuel 23:19</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Mighty men with David; </span> who were with David at this time, or who usually attended upon David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When they defied the Philistines; </span> when he either in the name of all the Israelites, or with the countenance and help of some of them, challenged the Philistines to fight.

He was with David at Pas-dammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle.” Pas-dammim, or Ephesdammim, where David slew Goliath, was in the valley of Elah, between Shochoh and Azekah. The name, signifying “boundary of blood,” was probably due to its being the scene of frequent skirmishes with the Philistines. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm" title="Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle, and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongs to Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.">1 Samuel 17:1</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">were gone away</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">went up</span> to battle.

He would thus belong to the most warlike tribe of Israel, though not mentioned among the Benjamites who joined David at Ziklag (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/12-1.htm">1 Chronicles 12:1-7</a>). He joined him, apparently, at an earlier date. That <span class="cmt_word">were there gathered together.</span> The word "there" implies the previous mention of some place, and though the text in the parallel passage in Chronicles is more corrupt than that before us, it has, nevertheless, preserved the name of the spot where the encounter took place. In Chronicles the name of Shammah is omitted, and his achievement is mixed up in a strange fashion with that of Eleazar. Here the two heroes have each his separate record, and it is only on minor matters that the text there is more correct. Restored from the readings in Chronicles, the narrative is as follows: "He was with David at Pas-dammim, and the Philistines were gathered there to battle, and the men of Israel were gone up: and he stood (that is, made a stand) and smote," etc. <span class="accented">Pas-dammim</span> is called <span class="accented">Ephes-dammim</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-1.htm">1 Samuel 17:1</a>. It was situated in the valley of Elah, and, as being upon the border, was the scene of numerous conflicts, whence its name, "the boundary of blood." It was there that David slew Goliath. <span class="cmt_word">Were gone away;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">went up</span>; that is, to battle. The idea that the Israelites had fled is taken from the parallel place in Chronicles, where, however, it refers to Shammah's exploit. In vers. 9 and 11 there, the phrase, "the Philistines were gathered together," occurs twice, and the scribe, having accidentally omitted the intervening words, has confused together the exploits of Eleazar and Shammah. In this battle Eleazar withstood the Philistine onset, and smote them till his hand clave to his sword hilt. Many such instances of cramp are recorded, and Mr. Kirkpatrick, in his commentary, quotes one in which the muscles of a warrior's hand could be relaxed, after hard fighting, only by fomentations of hot water. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/23.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>  1  Divine saying of David the son of Jesse,<p>Divine saying of the man, the highly exalted,<p>Of the anointed of the God of Jacob,<p>And of the lovely one in the songs of praise of Israel.<p>  2  The Spirit of Jehovah speaks through me,<p>And His word is upon my tongue.<p>This introduction to the prophetic announcement rests, both as to form and substance, upon the last sayings of Balaam concerning the future history of Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-15.htm">Numbers 24:15</a>). This not only shows to what extent David had occupied himself with the utterances of the earlier men of God concerning Israel's future; but indicates, at the same time, that his own prophetic utterance was intended to be a further expansion of Balaam's prophecy concerning the Star out of Jacob and the Sceptre out of Israel. Like Balaam, he calls his prophecy a &#1504;&#1488;&#1501;, i.e., a divine saying or oracle, as a revelation which he had received directly from God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-3.htm">Numbers 24:3</a>). But the recipient of this revelation was not, like Balaam the son of Beor, a man with closed eye, whose eyes had been opened by a vision of the Almighty, but "the man who was raised up on high" (&#1506;&#1500;, adverbially "above," is, strictly speaking, a substantive, "height," used in an adverbial sense, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>, and probably also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-16.htm">2 Samuel 7:16</a>), i.e., whom God had lifted up out of humiliation to be the ruler of His people, yea, even to be the head of the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44</a>). Luther's rendering, "who is assured of the Messiah of the God of Jacob," is based upon the Vulgate, "cui constitutum est de Christo Dei Jacob," and cannot be grammatically sustained. David was exalted on the one hand as "the anointed of the God of Jacob," i.e., as the one whom the God of Israel had anointed king over His people, and on the other hand as "the lovely one in Israel's songs of praise," i.e., the man whom God had enabled to sing lovely songs of praise in celebration of His grace and glory. &#1494;&#1502;&#1497;&#1512;  equals  &#1494;&#1502;&#1512;&#1492; does not mean a song generally, but a song of praise in honour of God (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-2.htm">Exodus 15:2</a>), like &#1502;&#1494;&#1502;&#1493;&#1512; in the headings to the psalms. As David on the one hand had firmly established the kingdom of God in an earthly and political respect as the anointed of Jehovah, i.e., as king, so had he on the other, as the composer of Israel's songs of praise, promoted the spiritual edification of that kingdom. The idea of &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-2.htm">2 Samuel 23:2</a>. The Spirit of Jehovah speaks through him; his words are the inspiration of God. The preterite &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; relates to the divine inspiration which preceded the utterance of the divine saying. &#1489;&#1468; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, literally to speak into a person, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-2.htm">Hosea 1:2</a>. The saying itself commences with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-3.htm">2 Samuel 23:3</a>.</body></html>
