It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Better as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-19.htm">1 Chronicles 11:19</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15, 16. the well of Beth-lehem&#8212;An ancient cistern, with four or five holes in the solid rock, at about ten minutes distance to the north of the eastern corner of the hill of Beth-lehem, is pointed out by the natives as Bir-Daoud; that is, David's well. Dr. Robinson doubts the identity of the well; but others think that there are no good grounds for doing so. Certainly, considering this to be the ancient well, Beth-lehem must have once extended ten minutes further to the north, and must have lain in times of old, not as now, on the summit, but on the northern rise of the hill; for the well is by or (1Ch 11:7) at the gate. I find in the description of travellers, that the common opinion is, that David's captains had come from the southeast, in order to obtain, at the risk of their lives, the so-much-longed-for water; while it is supposed that David himself was then in the great cave that is not far to the southeast of Beth-lehem; which cave is generally held to have been that of Adullam. But (Jos 15:35) Adullam lay "in the valley"; that is, in the undulating plain at the western base of the mountains of Judea and consequently to the southwest of Beth-lehem. Be this as it may, David's men had in any case to break through the host of the Philistines, in order to reach the well; and the position of Bir-Daoud agrees well with this [Van De Velde].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Is not this the blood of the men, </span> i.e. the price of their blood or lives, which they rashly exposed to manifest hazard? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">These things did these three mighty men; </span> either one of these three are here omitted, as one of the first three is not named, <span class="bld"> 1Ch 11</span>; or Abishai, who follows next, was one of these three. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And he said, be it far from me, O Lord, that one should do this,....

He also made himself renowned by a great victory over the Philistines. The enemy had gathered together &#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, "as a troop," or in a crowd. This meaning of &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; (here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a>, and possibly also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-11.htm">Psalm 68:11</a>) is thoroughly established by the Arabic (see Ges. Thes. p. 470). But it seems to have fallen into disuse afterwards, and in the Chronicles it is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-13.htm">2 Samuel 23:13</a> by &#1502;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-15.htm">2 Samuel 23:15</a> by &#1502;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492;. "On a portion of a field of lentils there," sc., where the Philistines had gathered together, the people (of Israel) were smitten. Then Shammah stationed himself in the midst of the field, and &#1497;&#1510;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492;, "wrested it," from the foe, and smote the Philistines. Instead of &#1506;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, lentils, we find in the Chronicles &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, barley, a very inconsiderable difference.</body></html>
