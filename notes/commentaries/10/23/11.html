It seems to be an instance of weakness. He was thirsty; with the water of that well he had often refreshed himself when a youth, and it was without due thought that he desired it. Were his valiant men so forward to expose themselves, upon the least hint of their prince's mind, and so eager to please him, and shall not we long to approve ourselves to our Lord Jesus, by ready compliance with his will, as shown us by his word, Spirit, and providence? But David poured out the water as a drink-offering to the Lord. Thus he would cross his own foolish fancy, and punish himself for indulging it, and show that he had sober thoughts to correct his rash ones, and knew how to deny himself. Did David look upon that water as very precious which was got at the hazard of these men's blood, and shall not we much more value those benefits for purchasing which our blessed Saviour shed his blood? Let all beware of neglecting so great salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/23.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Hararite - Interpreted to mean "mountaineer," one from the hill country of Judah or Ephraim. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/23.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 23:8-39.

These be the names of the mighty men whom David had&#8212;This verse should be translated thus: He who sits in the seat of the Tachmonite (that is, of Jashobeam the Hachmonite), who was chief among the captains, the same is Adino the Eznite; he lift up his spear against eight hundred, whom he slew at one time. The text is corrupt in this passage; the number eight hundred should be three hundred [Davidson, Hermeneutics]. Under Joab he was chief or president of the council of war. The first or highest order was composed of him and his two colleagues, Eleazar and Shammah. Eleazar seems to have been left to fight the Philistines alone; and on his achieving the victory, they returned to the spoil. In like manner Shammah was left to stand alone in his glory, when the Lord, by him, wrought a great victory. It is not very easy to determine whether the exploits that are afterwards described were performed by the first or the second three.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Full of lentiles, </span> or <span class="ital">barley</span>, as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm" title="He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.">1 Chronicles 11:13</a></span>; for both might very well grow in the same field, in divers parts of it.

The Revisers have retained in the margin, "or, for foraging:" but its occurrence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/68-10.htm">Psalm 68:10</a>, where it is tendered "thy congregation," and in the margin of the Revised Version," troop" makes it probable that" troop" is the right rendering here. <span class="cmt_word">Lentiles</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/11-13.htm">1 Chronicles 11:13</a>, "barley." The difference is probably caused by a transposition of letters.

The first and last clauses of this verse can only be made to yield a meaning in harmony with the context, by being taken interrogatively: "for is not my house so with God?" The question is only indicated by the tone (&#1500;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;  equals  &#1492;&#1500;&#1488; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-23.htm">2 Samuel 19:23</a>), as is frequently the case, even before clauses commencing with &#1500;&#1468;&#1488; (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-5.htm">Hosea 11:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-15.htm">Malachi 2:15</a> : cf. Ewald, 324, a.). &#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; (not so) is explained by the following clause, though the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which follows is not to be taken in the sense of "that." Each of the two clauses contains a distinct thought. That of the first is, "Does not my house stand in such a relation to God, that the righteous ruler will spring from it?" This is then explained in the second: "for He hath made an everlasting covenant with me." David calls the promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-12.htm">2 Samuel 7:12</a>., that God would establish his kingdom to his seed for ever, a covenant, because it involved a reciprocal relation-namely, that Jehovah would first of all found for David a permanent house, and then that the seed of David was to build the house of the Lord. This covenant is &#1489;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, "equipped (or provided) with all" that could help to establish it. This relates more especially to the fact that all eventualities were foreseen, even the falling away of the bearers of the covenant of God, so that such an event as this would not annul the covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-14.htm">2 Samuel 7:14-15</a>). &#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492;, "and preserved," i.e., established by the assurance that even in that case the Lord would not withdraw His grace. David could found upon this the certainty, that God would cause all the salvation to spring forth which had been pledged to his house in the promise referred to. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497;, "all my salvation," i.e., all the salvation promised to me and to my house. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1495;&#1508;&#1509;, not "all my desire," but "all the good pleasure" of God, i.e., all the saving counsel of God expressed in that covenant. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; before &#1500;&#1488; is an energetic repetition of the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which introduces the explanatory thought, in the sense of a firm assurance: "for all my salvation and all good pleasure, yea, should He not cause it to spring forth?"</body></html>
