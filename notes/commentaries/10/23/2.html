Let those who have had long experience of God's goodness, and the pleasantness of heavenly wisdom, when they come to finish their course, bear their testimony to the truth of the promise. David avows his Divine inspiration, that the Spirit of God spake by him. He, and other holy men, spake and wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. In many things he had his own neglect and wrong conduct to blame. But David comforted himself that the Lord had made with him an everlasting covenant. By this he principally intended the covenant of mercy and peace, which the Lord made with him as a sinner, who believed in the promised Saviour, who embraced the promised blessing, who yielded up himself to the Lord, to be his redeemed servant. Believers shall for ever enjoy covenant blessings; and God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, shall be for ever glorified in their salvation. Thus pardon, righteousness, grace, and eternal life, are secured as the gift of God through Jesus Christ. There is an infinite fulness of grace and all blessings treasured up in Christ, for those who seek his salvation. This covenant was all David's salvation, he so well knew the holy law of God and the extent of his own sinfulness, that he perceived what was needful for his own case in this salvation. It was therefore all his desire. In comparison, all earthly objects lost their attractions; he was willing to give them up, or to die and leave them, that he might enjoy full happiness, Ps 73:24-28. Still the power of evil, and the weakness of his faith, hope, and love, were his grief and burden. Doubtless he would have allowed that his own slackness and want of care were the cause; but the hope that he should soon be made perfect in glory, encouraged him in his dying moments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This song, which is found with scarcely any material variation as <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/18.htm">Psalm 18</a>, and with the words of this first verse for its title, belongs to the early part of David's reign when he was recently established upon the throne of all Israel, and when his final triumph over the house of Saul, and over the pagan nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-44.htm">2 Samuel 22:44-46</a>, Philistines, Moabites, Syrians, Ammonites, and Edomites, was still fresh <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21.htm">2 Samuel 21</a>.

The Spirit of the Lord spake by me&#8212;Nothing can more clearly show that all that is excellent in spirit, beautiful in language, or grand in prophetic imagery, which the Psalms of David contain, were owing, not to his superiority in natural talents or acquired knowledge, but to the suggestion and dictates of God's Spirit.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/23.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The following words, and consequently the other words and Psalms composed and uttered by me upon the like solemn occasions, are not to be looked upon as my private fancies or human inventions, but both the matter and the words of them are suggested and governed by God’s Spirit, which is the great Teacher of the church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/23.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The Spirit of the Lord spake by me,.... The psalms and songs he composed were not the fruits of his own genius, but were written by him under the inspiration of the Spirit of God; by whom holy men of God, the penmen of the Scriptures, spoke, even as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, of whom David was one, being a prophet; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-16.htm">Acts 1:16</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-30.htm">Acts 2:30</a>; so the Targum here,"David spoke by the spirit of prophecy of the Lord:''or spake "in me" (h); what he spoke was first internally impressed upon his mind by the Spirit of God, and then he expressed it with his tongue, as follows: <p>and his word was in my tongue; not only the matter of his psalms was indited by the Spirit of God, and suggested to his mind; but the very words in which they are delivered were given to him, and he was directed to make use of them, and did. <p>(h) "in me", Montanus, Junius &amp; Tremellius. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/23.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The Spirit of the LORD spake by me, and his word <i>was</i> in my <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> tongue.</span><p>(b) Meaning, he spoke nothing but by the motion of God's Spirit.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/23.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">the Spirit of the</span> Lord] A direct claim of inspiration, to which Christ Himself bears witness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-43.htm" title="He said to them, How then does David in spirit call him Lord, saying,">Matthew 22:43</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Observe the <span class="ital">parallelisms</span>, which constitute Hebrew poetry.<a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/22.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>47  Jehovah liveth, and blessed is my rock,<p>And the God of my refuge of salvation is exalted.<p>48  The God who giveth me vengeance,<p>And bringeth nations under me;<p>49  Who leadeth me out from mine enemies,<p>And exalteth me above mine adversaries,<p>Delivereth me from the man of violence.<p>The formula &#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; does not mean "let Jehovah live," for the word &#1497;&#1495;&#1497; would be used for that (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-16.htm">2 Samuel 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-24.htm">1 Samuel 10:24</a>), but is a declaration: "the Lord is living." The declaration itself is to be taken as praise of God, for "praising God is simply ascribing to Him the glorious perfections which belong to him; we have only to give Him what is His own" (Hengstenberg). The following clauses also contain simply declarations; this is evident from the word &#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501;, since the optative &#1497;&#1512;&#1501; would be used to denote a wish. The Lord is living or alive when He manifests His life in acts of omnipotence. In the last clause, the expression &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (rock) is intensified into &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1497; &#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; (the God of my refuge, or rock, of salvation), i.e., the God who is my saving rock (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-3.htm">2 Samuel 22:3</a>). In the predicates of God in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-48.htm">2 Samuel 22:48</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/22-49.htm">2 Samuel 22:49</a>, the saving acts depicted by David in vv. 5-20 and 29-46 are summed up briefly. Instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;, "He causes to go down under me," i.e., He subjects to me, we find in the psalm &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;, "He drives nations under me," and &#1502;&#1508;&#1500;&#1496;&#1497; instead of &#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;; and lastly, instead of &#1495;&#1502;&#1505; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in the psalm, we have here &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-2.htm">Psalm 140:2</a>. Therefore the praise of the Lord shall be sounded among all nations. </body></html>
