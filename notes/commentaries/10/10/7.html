Christ's soldiers should strengthen one another's hands in their spiritual warfare. Let nothing be wanting in us, whatever the success be.

The Ammonites Overcome.<p>6-14. when the children of Ammon saw that they stank before David&#8212;To chastise those insolent and inhospitable Ammonites, who had violated the common law of nations, David sent a large army under the command of Joab, while they, informed of the impending attack, made energetic preparations to repel it by engaging the services of an immense number of Syrian mercenaries.<p>Beth-rehob&#8212;the capital of the low-lying region between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon.<p>Zoba&#8212;(see on [271]2Sa 8:3).<p>of king Maacah&#8212;His territories lay on the other side of Jordan, near Gilead (De 3:14).<p>Ish-tob&#8212;that is, "the men of Tob"&#8212;the place of Jephthah's marauding adventures (see also 1Ch 19:6; Ps 60:1, title). As the Israelite soldiers poured into the Ammonite territory, that people met them at the frontier town of Medeba (1Ch 19:7-9), the native troops covering the city, while the Syrian mercenaries lay at some distance encamped in the fields. In making the attack, Joab divided his forces into two separate detachments&#8212;the one of which, under the command of his brother, Abishai, was to concentrate its attack upon the city, while he himself marched against the overwhelming host of mercenary auxiliaries. It was a just and necessary war that had been forced on Israel, and they could hope for the blessing of God upon their arms. With great judgment the battle opened against the mercenaries, who could not stand against the furious onset of Joab, and not feeling the cause their own, consulted their safety by flight. The Ammonites, who had placed their chief dependence upon a foreign aid, then retreated to entrench themselves within the walls of the town.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Choosing wisely to carry the war into their country, rather than to expect it in his own. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And when David heard of it,....

On the expression "it came to pass after this," see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. When Nahash, the king of the Ammonites, died, and Hanun his son reigned in his stead, David thought that he would show him the same kindness that Nahash had formerly shown to him. We are not told in what the love shown to David by Nahash consisted. He had most likely rendered him some assistance during the time of his flight from Saul. Nahash was no doubt the king of the Ammonites mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/11-1.htm">1 Samuel 11:1</a>, whom Saul had smitten at Jabesh. David therefore sent an embassy to Hanun, "to comfort him for his father," i.e., to show his sympathy with him on the occasion of his father's death, and at the same time to congratulate him upon his ascent of the throne.</body></html>
