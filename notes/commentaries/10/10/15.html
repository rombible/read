The rest of the men he gave to his brother Abishai, and stationed them against the Ammonites. "The front of the battle:" i.e., the face or front of the hostile army, when placed in battle array. Joab had this in front and behind, as the Ammonites had taken their stand before Rabbah at the back of the Israelitish army, and the Syrians by Medeba in their front, so that Joab was attacked both before and behind. This compelled him to divide his army. He chose out, i.e., made a selection. Instead of &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (the picked men in Israel) the Chronicles have &#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (the men in Israel), the singular &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; being more commonly employed than the plural to denote the men of war. The &#1489;&#1468; before &#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500; is not to be regarded as suspicious, although the early translators have not expressed it, and the Masoretes wanted to expunge it. "The choice of Israel" signifies those who were selected in Israel for the war, i.e., the Israelitish soldiers. Joab himself took up his station opposite to the Syrians with a picked body of men, because they were the stronger force of the two. He then made this arrangement with Abishai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-11.htm">2 Samuel 10:11</a>): "If Aram becomes stronger than I((i.e., overpowers me), come to my help; and if the Ammonites should overpower thee, I will go to help thee." Consequently the attack was not to be made upon both the armies of the enemy simultaneously; but Joab proposed to attack the Aramaeans (Syrians) first (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-13.htm">2 Samuel 10:13</a>), and Abishai was merely to keep the Ammonites in check, though there was still a possibility that the two bodies of the enemy might make their attack simultaneously.</body></html>
