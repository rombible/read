Hadarezer sent and brought out the Syrians that were beyond the river&#8212;This prince had enjoyed a breathing time after his defeat (2Sa 8:3). But alarmed at the increasing power and greatness of David, as well as being an ally of the Ammonites, he levied a vast army not only in Syria, but in Mesopotamia, to invade the Hebrew kingdom. Shobach, his general, in pursuance of this design, had marched his troops as far as Kelam, a border town of eastern Manasseh, when David, crossing the Jordan by forced marches, suddenly surprised, defeated, and dispersed them. As a result of this great and decisive victory, all the petty kingdoms of Syria submitted and became his tributaries (see on [272]1Ch 19:1).   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/10.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The men of seven hundred chariots; </span> Heb. <span class="ital">seven hundred chariots</span>, i.e. the men belonging to them, that fought in or with them; as plainly appears, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because the men only, and not the chariots, were capable of being killed, as these are said to have been. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because it is thus explained in the Book of Chronicles, which was written after this book, for this end, to explain what was dark or doubtful, and to supply what was omitted here; where, instead of these words, are seven thousand men which fought in chariots, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm" title="But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.">1 Chronicles 19:18</a></span>.

Although there might be seven thousand chariots in all, whereof seven hundred where <span class="ital">chosen ones</span>; according to the distinction made <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/14-7.htm" title="And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.">Exodus 14:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Forty thousand horsemen; </span> for which in <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm" title="But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.">1 Chronicles 19:18</a></span>, is forty thousand footmen; which may be reconciled divers ways. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Both these may be true, that he slew forty thousand horsemen, which being the most considerable part and strength of the army, it might seem sufficient to name them, and every one could easily understand that the footmen in that case were certainly cut off; and that he slew also forty thousand footmen, as is said in 1 Chronicles where he mentions them only, because they were omitted in 2 Samuel, and the horsemen being expressed here, it was needless to repeat them in <span class="bld"> 1Ch 2</span>. The horsemen may be here called <span class="ital">footmen</span>, in opposition to those that fought in chariots; because they sometimes fought on horseback, and sometimes came down from their horses, and fought on foot, when the place of the battle was more commodious for footmen than for horsemen; which it is not improbable was their case here; for David being a soldier of great prudence and experience, and understanding the great numbers of the Syrian horsemen, whereas the Israelites had but very few, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-16.htm" title="But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply horses: for as much as the LORD has said to you, You shall from now on return no more that way.">Deu 17:16</a></span>, would doubtless endeavour to choose a place as inconvenient for their horsemen as he could. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Peradventure the Syrians designed to bring the war into David’s country, and therefore hastened their march, and for that end put their footmen on horseback, (as hath been frequently done in like cases,) who, when they came to the place of battle, carne down from their horses, and fought on foot. So there is no need of acknowledging an error of the scribe in the sacred text; which yet if it were granted in such historical passages of no moment to the doctrine of faith and good life, it would not shake the foundation of our faith in matters of great importance, which it might reasonably be presumed the providence of God would more watchfully preserve from all depravation or corruption. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/10.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the Syrians fled before Israel,.... After an obstinate and bloody fight between them: <p>and David slew the men of seven hundred chariots of the Syrians; the word "men" is rightly supplied, for chariots could not be said to be slain, but the men in them; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-17.htm">1 Chronicles 19:17</a>, they are said to be seven thousand, here seven hundred; which may be reconciled by observing, that here the chariots that held the men are numbered, there the number of the men that were in the chariots given, and reckoning ten men in a chariot, seven hundred chariots held just seven thousand men; though Kimchi takes another way of reconciling the two places, by observing that here only the choicest chariots are mentioned, there all of them, but the former way seems best: <p>and forty thousand horsemen; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-17.htm">1 Chronicles 19:17</a>; it is forty thousand "footmen", and so Josephus (c); and the same may be called both horse and foot, be cause though they might come into the field of battle on horseback, yet might dismount and fight on foot; and so one historian calls them horsemen, and the other footmen; or the whole number of the slain, horse and foot mixed together, were forty thousand; Kimchi makes use of another way of removing this difficulty, and which perhaps is the best, that here only the horsemen are numbered that were slain, and there the footmen only, and both true; an equal number of each being slain, in all eighty thousand, besides the seven thousand in the chariots: <p>and smote Shobach the captain of their host, who died there; of his wounds upon the spot. <p>(c) Ut supra.

We have seen there that the word translated "chariots" means any vehicle or animal for riding. The numbers here are seven hundred chariots with their charioteers, and forty thousand horsemen; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> we have seventeen hundred horsemen and twenty thousand footmen; finally, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/19-18.htm">1 Chronicles 19:18</a> we find seven thousand chariots and charioteers, and forty thousand footmen. It is impossible to  reconcile these conflicting numbers, but as David had no cavalry, the numbers in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-4.htm">2 Samuel 8:4</a> are the more probable, namely, seventeen hundred cavalry and chariots, and twenty thousand infantry. The Syriac Version gives us here very reasonable numbers, namely, "seven hundred chariots, four thousand cavalry, and much people." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"Be firm, and let us be firm (strong) for our people, and for the towns of our God: and Jehovah will do what seemeth Him good."
