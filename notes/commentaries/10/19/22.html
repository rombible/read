Shimei lost no time. His abuse had been personal, and with the usual right feeling of good men, David could more easily forgive it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This is the first time that the "house of Joseph," or "Joseph," stands for all the ten tribes of which Ephraim was the head and leader. While Saul of Benjamin was king, or while Mahanaim was the capital of his son's kingdom, it was not natural so to name them, nor does it seem so at first sight in the mouth of Shimei the Benjamite. But it is very possible that he used the phrase for the purpose of exculpating himself and his own tribe from having taken the initiative in the rebellion, anti of insinuating that they were drawn away by the preponderating influence of the great house of Joseph. On the other hand, the phrase may be an indication that the passage was written after the separation of the kingdom of Israel, when the phrase was a common one. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

You pretend friendship herein, and would have me take it for an effect of your zeal for my service; but in truth you give me such counsel as my enemies would wish me to follow, that thereby I might awaken the fears and jealousies of my people which are now asleep, and cast them into a second rebellion: which either Joab and Abishai really designed by this advice, that so Joab might recover his place again, and be made necessary for the king’s service; or David suspected that they did so. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Do not I know that I am this day king over Israel?</span> is not my kingdom, which for my sins was in a manner wholly lost, just now restored and assured to me?

It probably means "one who would do me harm." Though David speaks of the sons of Zeruiah in the plural (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-10.htm">2 Samuel 16:10</a>), there is no reason to suppose that Joab shared in Abishai's impetuosity. Indifferent as he was to the shedding of blood, he was too prudent and politic to put the people out of temper by an execution on the day of David's return. <span class="cmt_word">In Israel... over Israel.</span> There is much force in this repetition. A short time before Israel had been for Absalom, but now, by Shimei's submission, and that of the large body of Benjamites with him, David felt that once again he was king over the whole people. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Return of the king; and occurrences at the crossing of the Jordan. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-15.htm">2 Samuel 19:15-23</a>.
