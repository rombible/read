It is translated “nourish” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/45-11.htm" title="And there will I nourish you; for yet there are five years of famine; lest you, and your household, and all that you have, come to poverty.">Genesis 45:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/47-12.htm" title="And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.">Genesis 47:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-21.htm" title="And God created great whales, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that it was good.">Genesis 1:21</a>, &c., and “sustain” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-9.htm" title="Arise, get you to Zarephath, which belongs to Zidon, and dwell there: behold, I have commanded a widow woman there to sustain you.">1Kings 17:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-21.htm" title="Yes, forty years did you sustain them in the wilderness, so that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.">Nehemiah 9:21</a>, &c.

Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom, they will be amazed at the recompence being so very far beyond the service, Mt 25:37. A good man would not go any where to be burdensome; or, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. It is good for all, but especially becomes old people, to think and speak much of dying.

Barzillai the Gileadite&#8212;The rank, great age, and chivalrous devotion of this Gileadite chief wins our respect. His declining to go to court, his recommendation of his son, his convoy across the Jordan, and his parting scene with the king, are interesting incidents. What mark of royal favor was bestowed on Chimham has not been recorded; but it is probable that David gave a great part of his personal patrimony in Beth-lehem to Chimham and his heirs in perpetuity (Jer 41:17).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now Barzillai was a very aged man, even fourscore years old,....

If we understand &#1488;&#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1491; as signifying that Mephibosheth had the ass saddled by a servant, and not that he saddled it with his own hands, the meaning is obvious, and there is no ground whatever for altering the text. &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; is certainly used in this sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/22-3.htm">Genesis 22:3</a>, and it is very common for things to be said to be done by a person, even though not done with his own hands. The rendering adopted by the lxx and Vulgate, "Thy servant said to him (the servant), Saddle me the ass," is not true to the words, though correct so far as the sense is concerned.</body></html>
