The Israelites Bring the King Back.<p>9-11. all the people were at strife throughout all the tribes of Israel&#8212;The kingdom was completely disorganized. The sentiments of three different parties are represented in 2Sa 19:9, 10: the royalists, the adherents of Absalom who had been very numerous, and those who were indifferent to the Davidic dynasty. In these circumstances the king was right in not hastening back, as a conqueror, to reascend his throne. A re-election was, in some measure, necessary. He remained for some time on the other side of Jordan, in expectation of being invited back. That invitation was given without, however, the concurrence of Judah. David, disappointed and vexed by his own tribe's apparent lukewarmness, despatched the two high priests to rouse the Judahites to take a prominent interest in his cause. It was the act of a skilful politician. Hebron having been the seat of the rebellion, it was graceful on his part to encourage their return to allegiance and duty; it was an appeal to their honor not to be the last of the tribes. But this separate message, and the preference given to them, occasioned an outburst of jealousy among the other tribes that was nearly followed by fatal consequences [see 2Sa 19:40-43].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My bones and my flesh; </span> of the same tribe, and some of you of the same family, with myself; and therefore if I should revenge myself of you, which perhaps you may fear I will do when I have fully regained my power, I should but tear my own flesh in pieces, and hate my own body which nature and interest obligeth every man to preserve. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Wherefore then are ye the last to bring back the king?</span> this delay doth not suit with the relation you have, and the affection you owe to me. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Ye are my brethren, ye are my bones and my flesh,....
