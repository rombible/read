A good man would not go any where to be burdensome; or, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. It is good for all, but especially becomes old people, to think and speak much of dying.

From the mention of “the habitation of Chimham which is by Bethlehem” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm" title="And they departed, and dwelled in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,">Jeremiah 41:17</a>, it has been ingeniously inferred that Chimham received a grant of land from David’s patrimony at Bethlehem, which retained his name for at least four centuries.

What Barzillai wished was that, when death overtook him, it should find him in the old abode of his family, where his father and mother had died, and where their tombs were. This regard for the family sepulchre was hereditary among the Israelites, who followed in it the example of their forefather (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-29.htm">Genesis 49:29-31</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Chimham</span>. David remembered Barzillai's kindness to the last, and. on his dying bed specially commended Chimham and his brothers to the care of Solomon. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-17.htm">Jeremiah 41:17</a> we read of "the habitation of Chimham, which is by Bethlehem," whence it has been supposed that David also endowed the sen of Barzillai with land near his own city. Stanley ('Jewish Church,' 2:201) considers that this was a caravanserai founded by Chimham for the hospitable lodging of travellers on their way to Egypt, and that Mary and Joseph found shelter there. It lay to the south of Bethlehem; but there is nothing more than the name to connect it with the son of Barzillai. In ver. 40 he is called in the Hebrew <span class="accented">Chimhan.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Barzillai comes to greet David. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-31.htm">2 Samuel 19:31</a>.
