Some commentators do take this view, but it is contradicted by the latter part of ver. 17. Really the Hebrew words signify no more than "at his crossing the Jordan," that is, at some time or other during the passage. Shimei's course was not only the boldest, but also the wisest. For, in the first place, his prompt surrender would commend itself to David's generosity; and, secondly, had Abishai's counsel been taken, it would have offended the thousand Benjamites who formed his escort, and also all the warriors present there from Israel (see ver. 40). Trouble and discontent would certainly have followed upon any attempt on David's part to punish any of his enemies, and there might even have been armed resistance to his crossing. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When these words of all Israel were reported to David, he sent to the priests Zadok and Abiathar, saying, "Speak to the elders of Judah, why will ye be the last to bring back the king to his palace? ... Ye are my brethren, my bones and flesh (i.e., my blood relations): why then," etc.? The last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>, "the speech of all Israel is come to the king, even to his house," is a circumstantial clause inserted in the midst of David's words, to explain the appeal to the men of Judah not to be the last. In the lxx, and some Codices of the Vulgate, this sentence occurs twice, viz., at the end of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>, and also of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a>; and Thenius, Ewald, and Bttcher regard the clause at the end of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a> as the original one, and the repetition of it at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a> as a gloss. But this is certainly a mistake: for if the clause, "and the speech of all Israel came to the king to his house (at Mahanaim)," ought to stand at the close of <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>, and assigns the reason for David's sending to Zadok and Abiathar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-11.htm">2 Samuel 19:11</a> would certainly, or rather necessarily, commence with &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;: "The word of all Israel came to the king, and then king David sent," etc. But instead of this, it commences with &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495; &#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491; &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, "But king David sent." This construction of the sentence decidedly favour the correctness of the Hebrew text; whereas the text of the Septuagint, apart altogether from the tautological repetition of the whole of the sentence in question, shows obviously enough that it is nothing more than a conjecture, by which the attempt was made to remove the difficulty occasioned by the striking position in which the circumstantial clause occurred. </body></html>
