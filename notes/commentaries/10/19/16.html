It is evident that Shimei was a man of influence and importance, and his accession to David at this juncture was of great value. At the same time, it is plain that Shimei himself was only a time-server, and that he was thoroughly disloyal in his heart, and only came now to David because he saw that his was “the winning cause.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/19-16.htm" title="And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men of Judah to meet king David....">2 Samuel 19:16-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Shimei hasted and came down to meet King David — </span>As Shimei had so insulted and abused David, he very justly concluded that he could have no hopes of pardon, but in consequence of his being one of the first to go and bring back the king. <span class="ital">There were a thousand men of Benjamin with him — </span>Whom he brought, partly to show his interest in the people, and the service he was capable of rendering the king; and partly that they might be intercessors on his behalf, and as witnesses of David’s clemency or severity, that in him they might see what the rest of them might expect. <span class="ital">Ziba </span>— Who, being conscious of his former abuse of David, and of his master Mephibosheth, which he knew the king would understand, designed to sweeten David’s spirit toward him, by his forwardness in meeting him. <span class="ital">They went over Jordan before the king —</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>They were so desirous to express their zeal, that they went further than the men of Judah, even to the other side of Jordan where the king was, and then, returning, passed over before him.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>19:16-23 Those who now slight and abuse the Son of David, would be glad to make their peace when he shall come in his glory; but it will be too late.

Expressing the deepest regret for his former outrageous conduct, he was pardoned on the spot; and although the son of Zeruiah urged the expediency of making this chief a public example, his officiousness was repulsed by David with magnanimity, and with the greater confidence that he felt himself now re-established in the kingdom (see on [276]1Ki 2:8).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/19.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite, which was of Bahurim,....

His adherence was, therefore, of importance. Ziba had always professed allegiance to David, and as he virtually represented the house of Stud, his presence was also valuable, even if prompted by the desire to keep Mephibosheth's land. For though Absalom seemed to be the nation's choice, yet there would be many legitimists who would consider that the crown belonged to Saul's heirs, and who would watch the course of events for any opportunity favourable to their views. David's victory ruined their hopes, and the public acts of Shimei and Ziba removed all fear of public disturbance on the part of Saul's friends. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Preliminaries to the return of David to Jerusalem. - <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-9.htm">2 Samuel 19:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm">2 Samuel 19:10</a>. As the rebellion was entirely crushed by Absalom's death, and the dispersion of his followers to their respective homes, there arose a movement among all the tribes in favour of David. "All the people were disputing (&#1504;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;, casting reproaches at one another) in all the tribes of Israel, saying, The king has saved us out of the hand of our enemies, ... and now he is fled out of the land before Absalom. But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle; and now why do ye keep still, to bring back the king?" This movement arose from the consciousness of having done an injustice to the king, in rising up in support of Absalom. </body></html>
