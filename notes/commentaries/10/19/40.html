The procession began as soon as Amasa had brought the Judahite escort, and the preference given to this tribe produced a bitter jealousy, which was nearly kindling a civil war fiercer than that which had just ended. A war of words ensued between the tribes&#8212;Israel resting their argument on their superior numbers; "they had ten parts in the king," whereas Judah had no more than one. Judah grounded their right to take the lead, on the ground of their nearer relationship to the king. This was a claim dangerous to the house of David; and it shows the seeds were already sown for that tribal dissension which, before long, led to the dismemberment of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Conducted the king; </span> attended upon him on his journey towards Jerusalem. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And also half the people of Israel; </span> whereas the men of Judah came entirely and unanimously to the king, as is noted here, and above, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-14.htm" title="And he bowed the heart of all the men of Judah, even as the heart of one man; so that they sent this word to the king, Return you, and all your servants.">2 Samuel 19:14</a></span>, the Israelites of the other tribes came in but slowly, and by halves, as being no less guilty of the rebellion than the tribe of Judah; but not encouraged and invited to come in by such a particular and gracious message as they were.

But at the instigation of the high priests and of Amasa, who was actually in command, they determined upon David's restoration, and acted so promptly and so independently of the rest of Israel that, when they reached Gilgal, only the delegates of a few tribes were in time to join them. As we read in ver. 41 of "all the men of Israel," it is evident that the rest had rapidly followed. It would have been well if the tribe of Judah had informed the rest of their purpose, as the bringing of David back would then have been the act of all Israel; but tribal jealousies were the cause of Israel's weakness throughout the time of the judges, and broke out into open disunion upon the death of Solomon. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/19.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>As Barzillai had supplied the king with provisions during his stay in Mahanaim (&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1492;, like &#1510;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492; for &#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1488;&#1492;, and other words of the same kind), because he was very wealthy (lit. great), David would gladly have taken him with him to Jerusalem, to repay him there for his kindness; but Barzillai replied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-34.htm">2 Samuel 19:34</a>.), "How many days are there of the years of my life (i.e., how long shall I have yet to live), that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem?
