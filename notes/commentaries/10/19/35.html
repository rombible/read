Thus, when the saints shall be called to inherit the kingdom, they will be amazed at the recompence being so very far beyond the service, Mt 25:37. A good man would not go any where to be burdensome; or, will rather be so to his own house than to another's. It is good for all, but especially becomes old people, to think and speak much of dying.

Mephibosheth had not merely inferred this from David's words, and the tone in which they were spoken, but had certainly found it out long ago, since Ziba would not delay very long to put David's assurance, that all the possessions of Mephibosheth should belong to him, in force against his master, so that Mephibosheth would discover from that how Ziba had slandered him. "And my lord the king is as the angel of God," i.e., he sees all just as it really is (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-17.htm">2 Samuel 14:17</a>); "and do what is good in thy sight: for all my father's house (the whole of my family) were but men of death against my lord the king (i.e., thou mightest have had us all put to death), and thou didst set thy servant among thy companions at table (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-11.htm">2 Samuel 9:11</a>); and what right or (what) more have I still to cry (for help) to the king?" The meaning is, "I cannot assert any claims, but will yield to anything you decide concerning me." It must have been very evident to David from these words of Mephibosheth, that he had been deceived by Ziba, and that he had formed an unfounded prejudice against Mephibosheth, and committed an act of injustice in handing over his property to Ziba. He therefore replied, in evident displeasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-29.htm">2 Samuel 19:29</a>), "Why talkest thou still of thine affairs? I have said, thou and Ziba shall divide the field?" to which Mephibosheth answered (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-30.htm">2 Samuel 19:30</a>), "He may take the whole, since my lord the king has returned in peace to his own house." This reply shows very clearly that an injustice had been done to Mephibosheth, even if it is not regarded as an expression of wounded feeling on the part of Mephibosheth because of David's words, but, according to the view taken by Seb. Schmidt and others, as a vindication of himself, as said not to blame the king for the opinion he had formed, but simply to defend himself. But this completely overthrows the opinion held by Thenius and O. v. Gerlach, that David's words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-30.htm">2 Samuel 19:30</a> contain nothing more than a revocation of his hasty declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>, and a confirmation of his first decision in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7-10</a>, and are to be understood as signifying, "Let everything be as I settled it at first; hold the property jointly," inasmuch as Ziba and his sons had of course obtained their living from the produce of the land. Moreover, the words "thou and Ziba divide the land" are directly at variance with the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-7.htm">2 Samuel 9:7</a>, "I will restore thee all the land of Saul thy father," and the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-9.htm">2 Samuel 9:9</a>, "I have given unto thy master's son all that pertained to Saul, and to all his house." By the words, "I have said, thou and Ziba divide the land," David retracted the hasty decree in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a>, so as to modify to some extent the wrong that he had done to Mephibosheth, but he had not courage enough to retract it altogether. He did not venture to dispute the fact that Mephibosheth had really been calumniated by Ziba, which was placed beyond all doubt by his mourning during the whole period of David's flight, as described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-24.htm">2 Samuel 19:24</a>. There is no ground for Winer's statement, therefore, that "it is impossible now to determine whether Mephibosheth was really innocent or not."  </body></html>
