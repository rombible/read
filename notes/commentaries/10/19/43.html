This was a natural contest between greater power and nearer relation; both claim a preference, which both cannot have; and which those of nearer relation should have yielded, both in point of prudence and affection for their friend, which the men of Judah did not. In all disputes it is natural for the party injured to be more angry; and therefore they who are in the wrong often assume that character, by supplying from passion whatever is wanting to them in point of reason and argument, as the tribe of Judah did now; for the text informs us, <span class="ital">that the words of the men of Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel — </span>That is, more vehement: instead of mollifying the Israelites with gentle words they answered them with greater fierceness: or they had the advantage of the men of Israel in their argument.

But while they were there, "all the men of Israel," representatives from the tribes not included in "half the people of Israel" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-40.htm">2 Samuel 19:40</a>, came up in great wrath at finding that the restoration had been accomplished without consulting them, and accused the men of Judah of unfair dealing. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>40-43. the king went on to Gilgal, &#8230; and all the people of Judah conducted the king, and also half the people of Israel&#8212;Whether from impatience to move on or from some other cause, David did not wait till all the tribes had arrived to conduct him on his return to the capital. The procession began as soon as Amasa had brought the Judahite escort, and the preference given to this tribe produced a bitter jealousy, which was nearly kindling a civil war fiercer than that which had just ended. A war of words ensued between the tribes&#8212;Israel resting their argument on their superior numbers; "they had ten parts in the king," whereas Judah had no more than one. Judah grounded their right to take the lead, on the ground of their nearer relationship to the king. This was a claim dangerous to the house of David; and it shows the seeds were already sown for that tribal dissension which, before long, led to the dismemberment of the kingdom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/19.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">We have ten parts; </span> they say but ten, though strictly there were eleven; either because they accounted Joseph (which comprehends both Ephraim and Manasseh under it) for one tribe, as it is sometimes reckoned; or because Simeon, whose lot lay within the tribe of Judah, were joined with them in this action. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the king, </span> i.e. in the kingdom, and the management of the affairs of it; the word <span class="ital">king</span> being put for <span class="ital">kingdom</span>, as it is <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-20.htm" title="And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the king on the throne of the kingdom.">2 Chronicles 23:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-15.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king: after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.">Isaiah 23:15</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-17.htm" title="These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.">Daniel 7:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-15.htm" title="So shall Bethel do to you because of your great wickedness: in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.">Hosea 10:15</a></span>.

They claim a share of the king, as king, in proportion to their number, and maintain this to be their right even in the case of David, whom the men of Judah might assert to belong specially to them as being their kinsman. But the Sept. preserves (in addition to a rendering of the present Heb. text), a different and very remarkable reading, which is perhaps the true one: <span class="ital">and I am the firstborn rather than thou</span>. Reuben, the natural firstborn, forfeited his birthright, and it was transferred to Joseph, the eldest son of Jacob’s second wife. In virtue of the birthright Joseph inherited a double portion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-17.htm" title="But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has: for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the firstborn is his.">Deuteronomy 21:17</a>) by Jacob’s adoption of his two sons Ephraim and Manasseh. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_chronicles/5-1.htm" title="Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was the firstborn; but for as much as he defiled his father's bed, his birthright was given to the sons of Joseph the son of Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright....">1 Chronicles 5:1-2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/48-22.htm" title="Moreover I have given to you one portion above your brothers, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow.">Genesis 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/16-4.htm" title="So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their inheritance.">Joshua 16:4</a>.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-31.htm">1 Kings 11:31, 35</a>, again, we have ten tribes given to Jeroboam, and here, also, not only must Benjamin be counted, but be included in the tribes rent from the house of David. The tribe that had disappeared was that of Simeon, partly lost among the desert races south of the Negeb, and partly absorbed by Judah. Its position always made it unimportant, and no trace can be found of its taking any part in the political life of Israel. Some strangers from Simeon are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/15-9.htm">2 Chronicles 15:9</a> as coming to the great gathering of Judah and Benjamin at Jerusalem after Asa had defeated Zerah the Ethiopian; and Josiah carried out his reformation in Simeon as well as in Manasseh, Ephraim, and Naphtali (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-6.htm">2 Chronicles 34:6</a>). But it never seems to have emerged from a state of semi-barbarism, and no town can be found within its territories. We must, therefore, omit Simeon, and of course the Levites, who took no part in politics, and thus we have Judah standing alone, and all the rest determined to resist any attempt on its part to establish a hegemony, and restless even at having to endure the more ancient claims of Ephraim to be the leading tribe. By the ten parts which they claim in the king, they meant that, as king, he belonged equally to all, and not to his own tribe only. In this they were expressing a sound view of the royal position. The next words, literally, are, "And also in David I am more than thou;" to which the Septuagint adds, "And I am the firstborn rather than thou." This is in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-1.htm">1 Chronicles 5:1</a>, and states an important claim always made by Ephraim; whereas the Hebrew, "I in David am more than thou," is unintelligible. Except upon the score of numbers already stated, the right of each tribe in David was equal. <span class="cmt_word">Why then,</span> etc.? rather, <span class="accented">Why hast thou despised me? Was not my word the first for bringing back the king?</span> (see ver. 9, and note on ver. 40). <span class="cmt_word">Were fiercer.</span> While the Israelites debated the matter calmly, the men of Judah met their complaint with harsh and bitter rejoinders.
