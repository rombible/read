Adoram was stoned to death by the people in the rebellion at the beginning of Rehoboam’s reign, as the representative of the hated system of forced labour which had oppressed the people beyond all endurance in Solomon’s reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm" title="Your father made our yoke grievous: now therefore make you the grievous service of your father, and his heavy yoke which he put on us, lighter, and we will serve you.">1 Kings 12:4</a>). The appearance of this new officer in the closing years of David’s reign is most significant of the vast change which had taken place in the character of his rule.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/20.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 24.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Adoram was over the tribute.</span> This was a new officer, and a new thing. For the Hebrew word <span class="accented">mas</span> does not mean "tribute," but "forced labour." This was one of the most oppressive exactions of old time, and it continued to be practised in Europe throughout the Middle Ages until it was abolished at the end of the eighteenth century by the French Revolution, except in Russia, where the serfs were freed from it by the late emperor Alexander II. Nevertheless, it was probably made almost necessary at first by the absence of money. As there was no money for the payment of taxes, the dues of the king or lord could only be rendered by personal service. Yet even so it was exceedingly liable to be abused, and the people might be taken from their own homes and fields just when their presence there was most needed. One most painful result was that the women had to endure, upon the farm and among the cattle, a drudgery to which they were unsuited. We gather from this passage that it was David who began this practice in Israel, exacting probably only from the descendants of the Canaanites (who, nevertheless, formed a considerable portion of the inhabitants of Palestine) forced labour employed in preparing for the building of the temple, and in the fortifications of his fenced cities. Under Solomon it seems to have been extended to other classes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13, 14</a>; but see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-20.htm">1 Kings 9:20-22</a>), and reduced to a system, which pressed so heavily upon the people  that it was the principal cause of the revolt of the ten tribes from Rehoboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-4.htm">1 Kings 12:4</a>). Unless the Israelites had themselves suffered severely from this exaction, they would not have been driven into rebellion by sympathy with the remains of the native races. Subsequently we find Jeremiah accusing Jehoiakim of employing forced labour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-13.htm">Jeremiah 22:13</a>), but the severity with which he condemned it suggests that it had then ceased to be customary. <span class="accented">Adoram.</span> His appointment to this office was probably at a late period in David's reign, as he continued to hold the office under Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a>, where he is called <span class="accented">Adoniram</span>), and even down to the beginning of Rehoboam's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>). We there read that he paid the penalty of his hateful office with his life. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-18.htm">2 Chronicles 10:18</a> he is called <span class="accented">Hadoram.</span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Then a wise woman of the city desired to speak to Joab, and said (from the wall) to him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-18.htm">2 Samuel 20:18</a>), "They were formerly accustomed to say, ask Abel; and so they brought (a thing) to pass." These words show that Abel had formerly been celebrated for the wisdom of its inhabitants.</body></html>
