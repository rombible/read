Whoever they may have been, they were naturally overcome and paralysed for the moment at the sight of the great leader whom the king had just promoted wallowing in his blood. Joab’s warrior, seeing the effect of their consternation, removed and concealed the body, and the pursuit then went on.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>20:4-13 Joab barbarously murdered Amasa. The more plot there is in a sin, the worse it is. Joab contentedly sacrificed the interest both of the king and the kingdom to his personal revenge. But one would wonder with what face a murderer could pursue a traitor; and how, under such a load of guilt, he had courage to enter upon danger: his conscience was seared.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/20.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the people ... - i. e., the levies which Amanda had been leading to Jerusalem; they were irresolute as to what they should do, and the stoppage at Amasa's body very nearly led to their refusing to follow Joab. But upon the prompt removal and hiding of the body they passed on and followed Joab, their old captain. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/20.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11-13. He that favoureth Joab, and he that is for David, let him go after Joab&#8212;It is a striking proof of Joab's unrivalled influence over the army, that with this villainous murder perpetrated before their eyes they unanimously followed him as their leader in pursuit of Sheba. A soldier conjoined his name with David's, and such a magic spell was in the word "Joab," that all the people "went on"&#8212;Amasa's men as well as the rest. The conjunction of these two names is very significant. It shows that the one could not afford to do without the other&#8212;neither Joab to rebel against David, nor David to get rid of Joab, though hating him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/20.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Wallowed, </span> Heb. <span class="ital">rolled himself</span>, being in the pangs of death; yet having so much life left as to move himself a little, though not to raise himself up from his place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In blood; </span> in his own blood, which was shed there. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">All the people, </span> to wit, the soldiers which were upon their march. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Stood still; </span> wondering at the spectacle, and inquiring into the author and occasion of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He removed Amasa out of the highway into the field; </span> perceiving that it both incensed them against Joab, and hindered the king’s present service. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/20.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Amasa wallowed in blood in the midst of the highway,....

The man, therefore, had the corpse carried out of the way, and threw over it a cloth, really a coat - the loose upper mantle worn over the tunic (see note on <span class="accented">beged</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/19-13.htm">1 Samuel 19:13</a>). Whereupon the people renewed their march, most of them not knowing what had occurred, and the rest urged to it by the warning voice of Joab's servitor. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/20.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>But when Amasa stayed out beyond the time fixed for the execution of the royal commission (the Chethib &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512; is the Piel &#1493;&#1497;&#1497;&#1495;&#1512;, whilst the Keri is either the Hiphil &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1495;&#1512;, or the imperfect Kal of &#1497;&#1495;&#1512;  equals  &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;, cf. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1494;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/20-9.htm">2 Samuel 20:9</a>, and is quite unnecessary), probably because the men of Judah distrusted him, and were not very ready to respond to his summons, David said to Abishai, "Now will Sheba the son of Bichri be more injurious (more dangerous) to us than Absalom. Take thou the servants (soldiers) of thy lord and pursue after him, lest he reach fortified cities, and tear out our eye," i.e., do us a serious injury.
