Christ is indeed a Stone of stumbling, and a Rock of offence, to those that are disobedient; but to those that believe, he is a Corner-stone, elect, precious, 1Pe 2:6-8. Let us be religious. Is the ark a blessing to others' houses? We may have it, and the blessing of it, without fetching it away from our neighbours. David, at first setting out, offered sacrifices to God. We are likely to speed in our enterprises, when we begin with God, and give diligence to seek peace with him. And we are so unworthy, and our services are so defiled, that all our joy in God must be connected with repentance and faith in the Redeemer's atoning blood. David attended with high expressions of joy. We ought to serve God with our whole body and soul, and with every endowment and power we possess. On this occasion David laid aside his royal robes, and put on a plain linen dress. David prayed with and for the people, and as a prophet, solemnly blessed them in the name of the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The meaning is, not that they sacrificed oxen and fatlings every six steps, which would have been impossible, but that when - after the arrangement made by David for the Levites to carry the ark <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-2.htm">1 Chronicles 15:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-12.htm">1 Chronicles 15:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-15.htm">1 Chronicles 15:15</a> they had borne it successfully and with visible tokens of God's favor, out of the house of Obed-edom and six "steps" on the road to the city of David to the sound of the musical instruments - then they stopped and offered solemn sacrifices. Possibly "the step" may have had a technical sense, and denoted a certain distance, say a stadium. Six such distances would have been nearly a mile, and if the ground was difficult and steep, the successful progress of "those that bare the ark," so far, would have been a fit cause for a thanksgiving sacrifice. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. when they that bare the ark &#8230; had gone six paces&#8212;Some think that four altars were hastily raised for the offering of sacrifices at the distance of every six paces (but see on [264]1Ch 15:26).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Had gone six paces</span> with safety and comfort.

Some think these seven oxen and rams were offered, at seven different times and places, at every six paces an ox and a ram; but this is not very likely. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was so, that when they that bare the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatlings.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">they that bare the ark of the</span> Lord] The requirements of the law were now duly observed, as is recorded at length in 1 Chronicles 15, where further details are given about the preparation of a tent to receive the Ark, the number of Levites who took part in the ceremony, and the arrangements for the music which accompanied the procession.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">had gone six paces</span>] As soon as the procession had started on its way, without any sign of the divine displeasure, David offered a sacrifice as a thank-offering for the prosperous commencement, and an intercession for the successful completion, of his undertaking.

"Evidently the way to the holy city was a way of blood. The stained streets of Zion, the rivers of blood, the slaughtered heaps and the blaze of altar fires formed a strange contrast to the dancing, the singing, and the harping of the multitudes who crowded the city" (Sime, 'Kingdom of All Israel,' p. 288). It is not necessary to suppose, with some objectors, that the ark waited till each sacrifice was completed, or that the road thus lined with victims was many miles in length. The ark did not remain at Perez-Uzzah, but was carried in silent awe to the house of a Levite; and such a house probably was not to be found until they were inside the city walls. There were no country houses in a region lately twice ravaged by the Philistines. But there is an objection to this view, namely, that it is not the sense of the Hebrew. What is there said is that at starting, after stepping six paces, David sacrificed an ox and a fatling (by the hands, of course, of the priests), to ask a blessing upon the removal of the ark, and avert all misfortune. In Chronicles we read nothing of this, but of a sacrifice of seven bullocks and seven rams, offered by the Levites. The one was David's offering made at the beginning, to consecrate the removal; the other was made at the end, and was a thank offering of the Levites, because they had carried the ark safely (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-26.htm">1 Chronicles 15:26</a>). The Vulgate has a remarkable addition to ver. 12, taken doubtless by Jerome from manuscripts which existed in his day. It is as follows: "There were with David seven choruses and a calf as victim." The fact is not in itself improbable, and means that the musicians and dancers were divided into bands which mutually relieved one another. And as a sacrifice was also a feast, each band had a calf provided for it. The LXX. omits the thirteenth verse altogether, and substitutes for it, "And seven choruses accompanied him. bearing the ark, and a calf and Iambs as a sacrifice." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When the procession had reached the threshing-floor of Nachon, Uzzah stretched out his hand to lay hold of the ark, i.e., to keep it from falling over with the cart, because the oxen slipped. And the wrath of the Lord was kindled, and God slew Uzzah upon the spot. Goren nachon means "the threshing-floor of the stroke" (nachon from &#1504;&#1499;&#1492;, not from &#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1503;); in the Chronicles we have goren chidon, i.e., the threshing-floor of destruction or disaster (&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;&#1493;&#1503;  equals  &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1491;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-20.htm">Job 21:20</a>). Chidon is probably only an explanation of nachon, so that the name may have been given to the threshing-floor, not from its owner, but from the incident connected with the ark which took place there. Eventually, however, this name was supplanted by the name Perez-uzzah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-8.htm">2 Samuel 6:8</a>). The situation of the threshing-floor cannot be determined, as all that we can gather from this account is that the house of Obed-edom the Gathite was somewhere near it; but no village, hamlet, or town is mentioned.<p>(Note: If it were possible to discover the situation of Gath-rimmon, the home of Obed-edom (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-10.htm">2 Samuel 6:10</a>), we might probably decide the question whether Obed-edom was still living in the town where he was born or not. But according to the Onom., Kirjath-jearim was ten miles from Jerusalem, and Gath-rimmon twelve, that is to say, farther off. Now, if these statements are correct, Obed-edom's house cannot have been in Gath-rimmon.)<p>Jerome paraphrases &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; thus: "Because the oxen kicked and turned it (the ark over." But &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1496; does not mean to kick; its true meaning is to let go, or let lie (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-11.htm">Exodus 23:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-2.htm">Deuteronomy 15:2-3</a>), hence to slip or stumble. The stumbling of the animals might easily have turned the cart over, and this was what Uzzah tried to prevent by laying hold of the ark. God smote him there "on account of the offence" (&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. from &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1492;, in the sense of erring, or committing a fault). The writer of the Chronicles gives it thus: "Because he had stretched out his hand to the ark," though of course the text before us is not to be altered to this, as Thenius and Bertheau suggest.</body></html>
