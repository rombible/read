It is angels' work to worship God, surely that cannot lower the greatest of men. But even the palaces of princes are not free from family troubles. Exercises of religion appear mean in the eyes of those who have little or no religion themselves. If we can approve ourselves to God in what we do in religion, and do it as before the Lord, we need not heed reproach. Piety will have its praise: let us not be indifferent in it, nor afraid or ashamed to own it. David was contented to justify himself, and he did not further reprove or blame Michal's insolence; but God punished her. Those that honour God, he will honour; but those that despise him, and his servants and service, shall be lightly esteemed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Play - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm">2 Samuel 6:5</a> note. The speech might be paraphrased, Before the Lord which chose me, etc., yea, before the Lord have I danced. He humbles Michal's pride by the allusion to her father's rejection, and shows by Saul's example how little pride contributes to the stability of greatness. Therefore, for his part, he will not think anything done for the glory of God too mean for him; and if he cannot have honor from Saul's daughter, he will be content to be honored by the maid-servants. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 6:20-23.

Michal &#8230; came out to meet David, &c.&#8212;Proud of her royal extraction, she upbraided her husband for lowering the dignity of the crown and acting more like a buffoon than a king. But her taunting sarcasm was repelled in a manner that could not be agreeable to her feelings while it indicated the warm piety and gratitude of David.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">It was before the Lord; </span> in his presence and service, which though contemptible to thee, is, and ever shall be, honourable in mine eyes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which chose me before thy father, and before all his house; </span> which took away the honour from him and his, and transferred it upon me, whereby he hath obliged me to love and serve him with all my might. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And David said unto Michal, it was before the Lord,....

No service offered to the God to whom he owed all his advancement could be degrading. Thus he defends his own conduct, and at the same time he humbles Michal’s pride by alluding to Saul’s rejection.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The Sept. (B) reads, “Before the Lord will I dance: blessed be the Lord who chose, &c.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is related of Sir Thomas More that he used, even when Lord Chancellor, to put on a surplice and sing in his parish church at Chelsea. The Duke of Norfolk one day found him doing so, and expostulated with him: “A parish clarke, lord chancellour, a parish clarke! you dishonour the King and his office.” “Nay,” quoth Sir Thomas, smiling upon the duke, “your grace may not thinke that the King, your maister and myne, will be offended with men for serving of God his Maister; or by this my present behaviour account his office dishonoured.” Wordsworth’s <span class="ital">Eccles.

"Before Jehovah, who chose me above thy father, and above all his house, to appoint me prince over Jehovah's people, over Israel, yea, before Jehovah I have rejoiced" (Authorized Version, "played;" but see notes on ver. 5). The preference of David over Saul was proof that that king's affectation of royal state, and his self-importance, were not pleasing in God's eyes. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And David danced with all his might before the Lord (i.e., before the ark), and was girded with a white ephod (shoulder-dress)." Dancing, as an expression of holy enthusiasm, was a customary thing from time immemorial: we meet with it as early as at the festival of thanksgiving at the Red Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm">Exodus 15:20</a>); but there, and also at subsequent celebrations of the different victories gained by the Israelites, none but women are described as taking part in it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/11-34.htm">Judges 11:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-19.htm">Judges 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-6.htm">1 Samuel 18:6</a>). The white ephod was, strictly speaking, a priestly costume, although in the law it is not prescribed as the dress to be worn by them when performing their official duties, but rather as the dress which denoted the priestly character of the wearer (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/22-18.htm">1 Samuel 22:18</a>); and for this reason it was worn by David in connection with these festivities in honour of the Lord, as the head of the priestly nation of Israel (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-18.htm">1 Samuel 2:18</a>). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-15.htm">2 Samuel 6:15</a> it is still further related, that David and all the house (nation) of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with jubilee and trumpet-blast. &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1506;&#1492; is used here to signify the song of jubilee and the joyous shouting of the people. In the Chronicles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-28.htm">1 Chronicles 15:28</a>) the musical instruments played on the occasion are also severally mentioned. </body></html>
