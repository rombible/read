If the preposition “<span class="ital">from</span>” is correct, we must assume that the narrator passes over the journey to Kirjath-jearim, and speaks of the return only: but this seems improbable, and most commentators emend the text in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-6.htm" title="And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up there the ark of God the LORD, that dwells between the cherubim, whose name is called on it.">1 Chronicles 13:6</a>, and read “<span class="bld">to.</span>”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The ancient versions however do not take the words as a proper name, but render them “<span class="ital">of the rulers</span>” or “<span class="ital">of the men, of Judah</span>,” the word being the same as that translated “<span class="ital">men</span>” in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2 Samuel 21:12</a>. If this is right, the name of the place has dropped out from the text and must be restored, so that the verse would read, “And David and all the people that were with him of the rulers of Judah arose and went to Baalah to bring up, &c.” This appears to have been the reading found by the LXX., though partly misunderstood by them, and has strong claims to be considered as the true text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The usual identification of Kirjath-jearim with <span class="ital">Kuryet-el-enab</span> (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-21.htm" title="And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim, saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the LORD; come you down, and fetch it up to you.">1 Samuel 6:21</a>) has lately been called in question by Lieut.

It lay about eight miles westward from Jerusalem (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-21.htm">1 Samuel 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/7-1.htm">1 Samuel 7:1, 2</a>). The preposition "from" is very startling, as really David went <span class="accented">to</span> Baale. Yet all the versions have it, but they put on Baale an incorrect meaning. Baal means "lord," "master," and they render, "David went with all the people that were  with him <span class="accented">from</span> [or, <span class="accented">of</span>] the citizens of Judah," understanding by "master" a householder, one who was master of a family. The real explanation probably is that the narrator wrote according to the sense, and not according to the grammar. The thought in his mind was the bringing up of the ark from its long resting place, and not the prior physical necessity of going down to the place where it was. <span class="cmt_word">With all the people.</span> David had consulted with "the captains of thousands and hundreds, and every leader" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-1.htm">1 Chronicles 13:1</a>), and it was with their good will that he drew the ark of God out of its long concealment. A select body of these nobles, or sheiks, would accompany the king, while the rest, with their attendants, would be posted along the eight miles of road. <span class="cmt_word">Whose name is called by the name.</span> In the Hebrew, the word "name" is twice repeated, the words literally being, <span class="accented">the ark of Elohim, whereon is called the Name, the Name of Jehovah of Sabaoth.</span> Most of the versions omit the second <span class="accented">Name</span>, and the translators of the Authorized Version also felt it to be a difficulty, which they have tried to escape by inserting words between the two. Really it is a most interesting sign of the existence at this early date of a special reverence for the name "with four consonants" which we call "Jehovah." Subsequently it was never pronounced, but the word "Lord" was read instead, in the Revised Version, the importance of the passage is well brought out by the first Name being written with a capital, of the use of which the Revisers are very chary. With their usual inconsecutiveness, they retain Lord for <span class="accented">Jehovah</span>, though this is "the Name," and though they have restored the word <span class="accented">Jehovah</span> in several less important places. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Philistines left their idols behind them there. They had probably brought them to the war, as the Israelites once did their ark, as an auxiliary force. "And David took them away." The Chronicles have "their gods" instead of "their idols," and "they were burned with fire" instead of &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488;&#1501;, "he took them away,"<p>(Note: This is the marginal reading in the English version, though the text has "he burned them." - Tr.)<p>took them as booty. The reading in the Chronicles gives the true explanation of the fact, as David would certainly dispose of the idols in the manner prescribed in the law (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a>). The same reading was also most probably to be found in the sources employed by our author, who omitted it merely as being self-evident. In this way David fully avenged the disgrace brought upon Israel by the Philistines, when they carried away the ark in the time of Eli.</body></html>
