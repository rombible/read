Let us learn hence, to think and to speak highly of God; and to think and speak honourably of holy ordinances, which are to us as the ark was unto Israel, the tokens of God's presence, Mt 28:20. Christ is our Ark; in and by him God manifests his favour, and accepts our prayers and praises. The ark especially typified Christ and his mediation, in which the name of Jehovah and all his glories are displayed. The priests should have carried the ark upon their shoulders. Philistines may carry the ark in a cart without suffering for it; but if Israelites do so, it is at their peril, because this was not what God appointed.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Played - i. e. danced to music vocal and instrumental (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-25.htm">Judges 16:25</a> note).<p>Cornets - Rather, from the etymology of the Hebrew word (to shake), and their being coupled with the cymbals, and being rendered sistra in the Vulgate, some kind of instrument with bells or rings, which gave a sound by being shaken. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. they set the ark of God upon a new cart&#8212;or a covered wagon (see on [262]1Sa 6:7).

Probably we should adopt the reading of the parallel passage in 1 Chron., <span class="bld">with all their might and with songs.</span> The Hebrew words are very similar, and the Sept. text here, though interpolated in its present form, supports the change.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">even on harps</span>, &c.] The harp (Heb. <span class="ital">kinnôr</span>) and psaltery (Heb. <span class="ital">nebel</span>) were stringed instruments, the exact form of which is unknown; the timbrel, also called the tabret, (Heb. <span class="ital">tôph</span>) was a tambourine or hand drum. The etymology of the word translated <span class="ital">cornet</span>, which occurs here only, shews that it denotes some kind of instrument which was played by being shaken, perhaps similar to the <span class="bld">sistrum</span> of the Egyptians, which consisted of rings hung loosely on iron rods, so as to make a tinkling sound when shaken. See the engravings in Wilkinson’s <span class="ital">Ancient Egyptians</span>, Vol. 1. p. 497 ff. Chron. reads “trumpets” which probably suggested the misrendering of the E. V. Cymbals were plates of metal, held in each hand, and played by being clashed together.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 5.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Played</span>. The word does not mean "played on a musical instrument," but "danced and rejoiced." <span class="cmt_word">On all manner... of fir wood.</span> The Hebrew literally is, <span class="accented">with all cypress woods.</span> In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-8.htm">1 Chronicles 13:8</a> we find "with all their might, even with songs," etc. Gesenius, in his 'History of the Hebrew Language,' describes this as a mere guess at a misunderstood text, and Maurer ridicules it as a stupid emendation. More sensibly Thenius regards it as the right reading, and the words here as a corruption of it, caused by some scribe misspelling the words, which are nearly identical. In our version the ambiguous meaning of the word "played" makes the passage less startling. For "they danced with all cypress woods" is unintelligible. The musical instruments mentioned here are the harp, Hebrew <span class="accented">chinnor</span>, a guitar; the psaltery, Hebrew <span class="accented">nebel</span>, a kind of <span class="cmt_word">harp</span> of a triangular shape, with the point downwards; the <span class="cmt_word">timbrel</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">tof</span>, a tambourine or small drum; the <span class="cmt_word">cornet</span>, Hebrew <span class="accented">mena'na'</span>, a bar on which were a number of loose metal rings, which were shaken in time to the music, but others think that "castanets" are meant, which are pieces of wood beaten in time. The Revised Version adopts this rendering. And finally <span class="cmt_word">cymbals</span>. For "cornets" we find in the parallel place "trumpets," whence the translators of the Authorized Version took their rendering; but the Hebrew word means "things to shake." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"And when thou hearest the rush of a going in the tops of the baca-shrubs, then bestir thyself," or hasten; "for Jehovah has gone out before thee, to smite the army of the Philistines." "The sound of a going," i.e., of the advance of an army, was a significant sign of the approach of an army of God, which would smite the enemies of Jehovah and of His servant David; like the visions of Jacob (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-2.htm">Genesis 32:2-3</a>) and Elisha (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-17.htm">2 Kings 6:17</a>). "Then thou shalt bestir thyself," lit. be sharp, i.e., active, quick: this is paraphrased in the Chronicles by "then thou shalt go out to battle." </body></html>
