Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul sought his. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor are we to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have been most careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men are not to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. See how patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ, who prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spirit will turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead of being provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comforts himself that God would bring good out of his affliction. We may depend upon God to repay, not only our services, but our sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All the blood of the house of Saul - Shimei probably put to David's account the death of Saul, and Jonathan, and Abinadab, and Melchishua, slain in battle by the Philistines with whom David was in league; of Ish-bosheth, slain in consequence of David's league with Abner; that of Abner himself, which he attributed to David's secret orders; and all the 360 slain in the battle between Joab and Abner <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/2-31.htm">2 Samuel 2:31</a>. Some, too, think that the death of seven men of Saul's immediate family <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm">2 Samuel 21:8</a> had occurred before David's flight, and was referred to by Shimei. Shimei's hatred and virulence is an indication that the Benjamites resented the loss of royalty in their tribe, even in the palmiest days of David's monarchy. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 16:5-19. Shimei Curses David.<p>5-12. when king David came to Bahurim&#8212;a city of Benjamin (2Sa 3:16; 19:16). It is, however, only the confines of the district that are here meant.<p>Shimei, &#8230; a man of the family of Saul&#8212;The misfortune of his family, and the occupation by David of what they considered their rightful possessions, afforded a natural, if not a justifiable cause for this ebullition of rude insults and violence. He upbraided David as an ambitious usurper, and charged him, as one whose misdeeds had recoiled upon his own head, to surrender a throne to which he was not entitled. His language was that of a man incensed by the wrongs that he conceived had been done to his house. David was guiltless of the crime of which Shimei accused him; but his conscience reminded him of other flagrant iniquities; and he, therefore, regarded the cursing of this man as a chastisement from heaven. His answer to Abishai's proposal evinced the spirit of deep and humble resignation&#8212;the spirit of a man who watched the course of Providence, and acknowledged Shimei as the instrument of God's chastening hand. One thing is remarkable, that he acted more independently of the sons of Zeruiah in this season of great distress than he could often muster courage to do in the days of his prosperity and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">All the blood of the house of Saul; </span> either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.
