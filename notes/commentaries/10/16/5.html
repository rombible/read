Many of the Benjamites naturally felt aggrieved when the royal house passed away from their tribe; and, although under restraint while David’s government was strong, were ever ready to show their opposition and hatred when opportunity offered, as now with Shimei, and a little later with Sheba, the son of Bichri (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/20-1.htm" title="And there happened to be there a man of Belial, whose name was Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite: and he blew a trumpet, and said, We have no part in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: every man to his tents, O Israel.">2Samuel 20:1-2</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/16-5.htm" title="And when king David came to Bahurim, behold, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shimei, the son of Gera: he came forth, and cursed still as he came....">2 Samuel 16:5-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">When David came to Bahurim — </span>The next village in his way to the wilderness; that is, when he came to the territory of it, for he did not reach the place itself till afterward, as is mentioned <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-14.htm" title="And the king, and all the people that were with him, came weary, and refreshed themselves there.">2 Samuel 16:14</a>. <span class="ital">Thence came out a man, and cursed still as he came — </span>Out of an inveterate hatred to David; whom he looked upon as the great enemy of the family of Saul, to which he belonged. <span class="ital">And he cast stones, </span>&c. — To show his contempt of David and his servants. <span class="ital">All his mighty men were on his right hand and on his left — </span>This is observed to show the prodigious madness of the man.

Once and again David spared Saul's life, while Saul sought his. But innocence is no defence against malice and falsehood; nor are we to think it strange, if we are charged with that which we have been most careful to keep ourselves from. It is well for us, that men are not to be our judges, but He whose judgment is according to truth. See how patient David was under this abuse. Let this remind us of Christ, who prayed for those who reviled and crucified him. A humble spirit will turn reproaches into reproofs, and get good from them, instead of being provoked by them. David the hand of God in it, and comforts himself that God would bring good out of his affliction. We may depend upon God to repay, not only our services, but our sufferings.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Bahurim - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-16.htm">2 Samuel 3:16</a> note.

Shimei Curses David.<p>5-12. when king David came to Bahurim&#8212;a city of Benjamin (2Sa 3:16; 19:16). It is, however, only the confines of the district that are here meant.<p>Shimei, &#8230; a man of the family of Saul&#8212;The misfortune of his family, and the occupation by David of what they considered their rightful possessions, afforded a natural, if not a justifiable cause for this ebullition of rude insults and violence. He upbraided David as an ambitious usurper, and charged him, as one whose misdeeds had recoiled upon his own head, to surrender a throne to which he was not entitled. His language was that of a man incensed by the wrongs that he conceived had been done to his house. David was guiltless of the crime of which Shimei accused him; but his conscience reminded him of other flagrant iniquities; and he, therefore, regarded the cursing of this man as a chastisement from heaven. His answer to Abishai's proposal evinced the spirit of deep and humble resignation&#8212;the spirit of a man who watched the course of Providence, and acknowledged Shimei as the instrument of God's chastening hand. One thing is remarkable, that he acted more independently of the sons of Zeruiah in this season of great distress than he could often muster courage to do in the days of his prosperity and power.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Bahurim; </span> a city in Benjamin, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-16.htm" title="And her husband went with her along weeping behind her to Bahurim.
