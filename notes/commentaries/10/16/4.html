David asks the question, evidently hurt at the apparent ingratitude of Mephibosheth. It is impossible to say whether Mephibosheth was quite guiltless or not. If <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/116.htm">Psalm 116</a> was composed by David, and after the quelling of Absalom's rebellion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-11.htm">2 Samuel 16:11</a> may contain David's confession of his present hasty judgment <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-4.htm">2 Samuel 16:4</a> in the matter. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. To-day shall the house of Israel restore me the kingdom of my father&#8212;Such a hope might not unnaturally arise at this period of civil distraction, that the family of David would destroy themselves by their mutual broils, and the people reinstate the old dynasty. There was an air of plausibility in Ziba's story. Many, on whom the king had conferred favors, were now deserting him. No wonder, therefore, that in the excitement of momentary feeling, believing, on the report of a slanderer, Mephibosheth to be among the number, he pronounced a rash and unrighteous judgment by which a great injury was inflicted on the character and interests of a devoted friend.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth; </span> a rash sentence, and unrighteous, to condemn a man unheard, upon the single testimony of his accuser and servant. But David’s mind was both clouded by the deep sense of his calamity, and biassed by Ziba’s great and seasonable kindness, And he might think that Ziba would not dare to accuse his master of so great a crime, which, if false, might so easily be disproved. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight:</span> thy favour is more to me than this gift; which, as a token of thy favour, I accept with all thankfulness. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/16.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said the king to Ziba, behold, thine are all that pertaineth to Mephibosheth,.... Being forfeited to the king by an overt act of treason as they had been before by the rebellion of Ishbosheth, but had been graciously restored to Mephibosheth; and had it been true what Ziba suggested, it would have been a righteous thing to have taken them from him; though it seems to be too hasty a step in David to take and give them away without further inquiry: <p>and Ziba said, I humbly beseech thee that I may find grace in thy sight, my lord, O king; he had found favour already, but seems not to be sufficiently thankful for it, and satisfied with it, but craved more and other favours, when opportunity should serve. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said the king to Ziba, Behold, thine are all that pertained unto Mephibosheth.
