The fact that this punishment takes place on the very roof where David had first yielded to his guilty passion makes it particularly striking.<p><span class= "bld"><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/16.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-22.htm" title="So they spread Absalom a tent on the top of the house; and Absalom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.">2 Samuel 16:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">So they spread a tent upon the top of the house — </span>Of the king’s palace, the very place from whence David had gazed upon Bath-sheba: so that his sin was legible in the very place of his punishment. <span class="ital">And Absalom went in unto his father’s concubines — </span>To one or some of them. <span class="ital">In the sight of all Israel </span>— Who saw him go into the tent, and thence concluded that he had converse with them as he had designed. “An action of such profligate impiety, and abandoned impudence, as it were to be wished no sun had seen, or history related.” By this we may see the character of Absalom and his party, and how abominably wicked they must have been, whom such a scandalous action tied the faster to him. And we may further learn how corrupt the body of the people were, and how ripe for that judgment, which was now hastening toward them. Now was David’s adultery (which had been planned, and, it may be, perpetrated in the same place) judicially chastised, and God’s vengeance denounced upon it by his prophet signally executed, and his wives prostituted <span class="ital">in the sight of the sun, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-11.htm" title="Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house, and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.">2 Samuel 12:11</a>.

But miserable counsellors were they both. Hushai would never counsel him to do wisely. Ahithophel counselled him to do wickedly; and so did as effectually betray him, as he did, who was designedly false to him: for they that advise men to sin, certainly advise them to their hurt. After all, honesty is the best policy, and will be found so in the long run. Ahithophel gave wicked counsel to Absalom; to render himself so hateful to his father, that he would never be reconciled to him; this cursed policy was of the devil. How desperately wicked is the human heart!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/16.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Taking possession of the harem was the most decided act of sovereignty (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/2-22.htm">1 Kings 2:22</a>). It was also the greatest offence and insult that could be offered. Such an act on Absalom's part made reconciliation impossible. A further motive has been found in this advice, namely, the desire on the part of Ahithophel to make David taste the bitterness of that cup which he had caused others (Uriah and all Bath-sheba's family) to drink, and receive the measure which he had meted withal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/16.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Ahithophel said unto Absalom&#8212;This councillor saw that now the die was cast; half measures would be inexpedient. To cut off all possibility of reconciliation between the king and his rebellious son, he gave this atrocious advice regarding the treatment of the royal women who had been left in charge of the palace. Women, being held sacred, are generally left inviolate in the casualties of war. The history of the East affords only one parallel to this infamous outrage of Absalom.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/16.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Upon the top of the house, </span> to wit, of the king’s palace, the very place from whence David had spied and gazed upon Bath-sheba, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-2.htm" title="And it came to pass in an evening, that David arose from off his bed, and walked on the roof of the king's house: and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself; and the woman was very beautiful to look on.">2 Samuel 11:2</a></span>.

The Targum renders it, a canopy; which Kimchi describes as consisting of four pillars, upon and round about which curtains were hung: <p>and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel; they saw the tent or canopy erected, and saw him go into it, and might reasonably conclude he lay with his father's concubines, or half wives, in it; and this being done in so public a manner fulfilled the prophecy, which said it should be done in the sight of the sun, and of all Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-11.htm">2 Samuel 12:11</a>; this shows how corrupt the people of Israel were at this time, at least those that were with Absalom, that there should be none to object to the counsel Ahithophel gave, nor any to remonstrate against the execution of it, but all seemed to look upon it with pleasure; nor even did Hushai, David's friend, oppose it; perhaps he saw it was to no purpose. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/16.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So they spread Absalom a tent upon the top of the house; and Absalom went in unto his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/16.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">upon the top of the house</span>] The fact that the very roof on which David was walking when he secretly conceived his great sin was the public scene of its punishment, and the nature of the punishment, corresponding to the nature of the sin, as Nathan had foretold, make this retribution signally striking.
