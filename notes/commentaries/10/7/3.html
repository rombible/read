He formed a design to build a temple for the ark. Nathan here did not speak as a prophet, but as a godly man, encouraging David by his private judgment.

From the two last passages it appears that he wrote the history of David's reign, and a part at least of Solomon's. His distinctive title is the prophet, that of Gad the seer (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-9.htm">1 Samuel 9:9</a>). He was probably nuch younger than David. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-3.htm">2 Samuel 7:3</a>, he spoke his own private opinion; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-4.htm">2 Samuel 7:4</a>, this was corrected by the word of the Lord. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

The design being pious, and the thing not forbidden by God, Nathan hastily approves it, before he had either seriously considered it in his own mind, or consulted God about it, as both he and David certainly ought to have done in a matter of so great moment. And therefore Nathan meets with this rebuke, that he is forced to acknowledge his error, and recant it. For the holy prophets did not speak all things by prophetical inspiration, but some things by a human spirit, and prudent conjecture; and therefore they were ignorant and mistaken in some matters, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm" title="And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.">1 Samuel 16:6</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-27.htm" title="And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away.

He perceived it was in his heart to build an house for God; he knew an house was to be built at one time or another, by some person or another; he knew it was a good work, and fit for a king to do, and might think this was a proper time any, he being at leisure, and therefore encouraged him to it: but inasmuch as the time when and the person by whom this was to be built were not pointed out particularly in the word of God, David and he should have consulted the Lord about it; in this they erred, and for which they were tacitly reproved; for, as the event shows, this was not the time when, nor David the person by whom, it was to be built. Nathan said this as a pious and good man, in a private capacity, not as a prophet, or under a spirit of prophecy; for prophets did not always speak under such an influence, but, as private men, said some things ignorantly and through mistake; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-6.htm">1 Samuel 16:6</a>, <p>for the Lord is with thee; prospering and succeeding him in all he undertook, giving him rest from all his enemies; and he might think that this motion he now made of building an house was from the Lord; the Targum is,"the Word of the Lord shall be for thine help,'' <p>or thine helper, and shall assist thee in this work. David being thus encouraged by the prophet, his thoughts were more employed about it, and he was resolute and eager to perform it; and now it was he penned the hundred thirty second psalm, in which he expresses his oath and vow to find a place to build on, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/132-1.htm">Psalm 132:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And Nathan said to the king, Go, do all that is in thine heart; for the LORD is with thee.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Go, do all that is in thine heart.</span> Nathan rashly approves. The king's purpose seems so pious that he does not doubt its acceptance by God. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David returned home to bless his house, as he had previously blessed the people, Michal came to meet him with scornful words, saying, "How has the king of Israel glorified himself to-day, when he stripped himself before the eyes of the maids of his servants, as only one of the loose people strips himself!" The unusual combination &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is explained by Ewald (240, e., p. 607) in this manner, that whilst, so far as the sense of the clause is concerned, the second verb ought to be in the infinitive absolute, they were both written with a very slight change of form in the infinitive construct; whereas others regard &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; as an unusual form of the infinitive absolute (Ges. Lehrgeb. p. 430), or a copyist's error for &#1504;&#1490;&#1500;&#1492; (Thenius, Olsh. Gr. p. 600). The proud daughter of Saul was offended at the fact, that the king had let himself down on this occasion to the level of the people. She availed herself of the shortness of the priests' shoulder-dress, to make a contemptuous remark concerning David's dancing, as an impropriety that was unbecoming in a king. "Who knows whether the proud woman did not intend to sneer at the rank of the Levites, as one that was contemptible in her eyes, since their humble service may have looked very trivial to her?"
