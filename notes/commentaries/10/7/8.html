These promises relate to Solomon, David's immediate successor, and the royal line of Judah. But they also relate to Christ, who is often called David and the Son of David. To him God gave all power in heaven and earth, with authority to execute judgment. He was to build the gospel temple, a house for God's name; the spiritual temple of true believers, to be a habitation of God through the Spirit. The establishing of his house, his throne, and his kingdom for ever, can be applied to no other than to Christ and his kingdom: David's house and kingdom long since came to an end. The committing iniquity cannot be applied to the Messiah himself, but to his spiritual seed; true believers have infirmities, for which they must expect to be corrected, though they are not cast off.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The tribes of Israel - The duplicate passage reads judges (see margin and compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-11.htm">2 Samuel 7:11</a>).

Beams of cedar marked a costly building. The cedar of Lebanon is a totally different tree from what we improperly call the red or Virginian cedar, which supplies the sweet-scented cedar wood, and is really a kind of juniper. The cedar of Lebanon is a close-grained, light-colored, yellowish wood, with darker knots and veins. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2Sa 7:4-17.

For it was taken well at his hands, in part, that it was in his heart, and he had a desire to build an house for God, though he was wrong in determining upon it without seeking the Lord; and lest he should be discouraged by the prohibition of him from building, the following things are observed to assure him it was not from disregard unto him, or displeasure at him, that he would not be employed in this service; since the Lord had given sufficient tokens of his favour to him, and with which he should be content, as having honour enough done him; it was enough that God had raised him up from a low estate to great grandeur and dignity: <p>thus saith the Lord of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel; for that was his employment, to keep his father's sheep, before he was taken into Saul's court, and married his daughter, when after his death he came to have the crown, of Israel: now this is said, not to upbraid him with his former meanness, but to observe the goodness of God unto him, and what reason he had for thankfulness, and to look upon himself as a favourite of God, who of a keeper of sheep was made a shepherd of men, to rule and feed them; so Cyrus is called a shepherd, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-28.htm">Isaiah 44:28</a>; and Agamemnon, in Homer (w), is called "the shepherd of the people". <p>(w) Iliad. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, from following the sheep, to be ruler over my people, over Israel:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8</span>. <span class="ital">from the sheepcote</span>] Rather, <span class="bld">from the pasture.</span> Cp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/78-70.htm" title="He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:...">Psalm 78:70-71</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be ruler</span>] Cp. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-2.htm" title="Also in time past, when Saul was king over us, you were he that led out and brought in Israel: and the LORD said to you, You shall feed my people Israel, and you shall be a captain over Israel.">2 Samuel 5:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-21.htm" title="And David said to Michal, It was before the LORD, which chose me before your father, and before all his house, to appoint me ruler over the people of the LORD, over Israel: therefore will I play before the LORD.">2 Samuel 6:21</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/2_samuel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 8.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I took thee from the sheepcote.</span> There is in Nathan's message a marked advance upon the words of all previous prophecies. Hitherto God's promises had been general, and no tribe, and much less any special person, had been chosen as the progenitor of the Messiah. The nearest approach to the selection of a tribe had been the prediction of Judah's supremacy until Shiloh came (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-10.htm">Genesis 49:10</a>); but it was not even there expressly declared that Shiloh should be of Judah's race. But now David is clearly chosen. Jehovah takes him from the sheepcote; Hebrew, "the meadow" (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-70.htm">Psalm 78:70</a>). It was in the meadows, the Naioth, round Ramah, that Samuel had gathered the young men of Israel to study their ancient records, and raise their country to a sense of its high calling. In those meadows David had been formed for his high vocation; but he had returned from them to Bethlehem, to feed his father's sheep. And now, "from following the ewes that gave suck," Jehovah takes him to be "his servant," a word of high dignity, applied to but few persons in the Old Testament. It signifies the prime minister, or vicegerent of Jehovah, as the theocratic king, and is the special title of Moses among God's people, and, among the heathen, of Nebuchadnezzar, as one summoned to do a great work for God. But it is in the last twenty-seven chapters of Isaiah that the title reaches its full grandeur. For there, first of all, Israel is called Jehovah's servant, because it was Israel's office to be the witness for the oneness of God amidst the debasing polytheism of all the nations round. And then, finally, the servant is Messiah, as being the personal Representative of God upon earth. The title is now given to David as the type of Christ's kingly office, and also as the sweet singer, who added a new service to the worship of God, and made it more spiritual, and more like the service of angels round God's throne. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David was dwelling in his house, i.e., the palace of cedar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>), and Jehovah had given him rest from all his enemies round about, he said to Nathan the prophet: "See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, and the ark of God dwelleth within the curtains." &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; in the singular is used, In <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-2.htm">Exodus 26:2</a>., to denote the inner covering, composed of a number of lengths of tapestry sewn together, which was spread over the planks of the tabernacle, and made it into a dwelling, whereas the separate pieces of tapestry are called &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1514; in the plural; and hence, in the later writers, &#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; alternates sometimes with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-2.htm">Isaiah 54:2</a>), and at other times with &#1488;&#1492;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; (Sol 1:5; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-20.htm">Jeremiah 4:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-29.htm">Jeremiah 49:29</a>). Consequently &#1492;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1506;&#1492; refers here to the tent-cloth or tent formed of pieces of tapestry. "Within (i.e., surrounded by) the tent-cloth:" in the Chronicles we find "under curtains." From the words "when the Lord had given him rest from all his enemies round about," it is evident that David did not form the resolution to build the temple in the first years of his reign upon Zion, nor immediately after the completion of his palace, but at a later period (see the remarks on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>, note). It is true that the giving of rest from all his enemies round about does not definitely presuppose the termination of all the greater wars of David, since it is not affirmed that this rest was a definitive one; but the words cannot possibly be restricted to the two victories over the Philistines (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17-25</a>), as Hengstenberg supposes, inasmuch as, however important the second may have been, their foes were not even permanently quieted by them, to say nothing of their being entirely subdued. Moreover, in the promise mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-9.htm">2 Samuel 7:9</a>, God distinctly says, "I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest, and have cut off all thine enemies before thee." These words also show that at that time David had already fought against all the enemies round about, and humbled them. Now, as all David's principal wars are grouped together for the first time in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a> and 10, there can be no doubt that the history is not arranged in a strictly chronological order. And the expression "after this" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a> is by no means at variance with this, since this formula does not at all express a strictly chronological sequence. From the words of the prophet, "Go, do all that is in thy heart, for the Lord is with thee," it is very evident that David had expressed the intention to build a splendid palatial temple. The word &#1500;&#1498;, go (equivalent to "quite right"), is omitted in the Chronicles as superfluous. Nathan sanctioned the king's resolution "from his own feelings, and not by divine revelation" (J. H. Michaelis); but he did not "afterwards perceive that the time for carrying out this intention had not yet come," as Thenius and Bertheau maintain; on the contrary, the Lord God revealed to the prophet that David was not to carry out his intention at all. </body></html>
