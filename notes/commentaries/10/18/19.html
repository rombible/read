The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence, or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ahimaaz was a well-known runner <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-27.htm">2 Samuel 18:27</a>.

Then said Ahimaaz &#8230; Let me &#8230; run and bear the king tidings&#8212;The reasons why Joab declined to accept Ahimaaz' offer to bear intelligence of the victory to David, and afterwards let him go along with another, are variously stated by commentators&#8212;but they are of no importance. Yet the alacrity of the messengers, as well as the eager excitement of the expectants, is graphically described.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok,.... To Joab; for it seems he stayed with the army when he with Jonathan brought the message from Hushai to David: <p>let me now run, and bear the king tidings how that the Lord hath avenged him on his enemies; which he thought would be very acceptable to hear of as soon as possible; and to be a messenger with tidings of a victory, as it was honourable, so likewise profitable then as now; though perhaps Ahimaaz might have no respect to the reward, as indeed none could be expected, since the death of Absalom would be so disagreeable to the king; but was desirous of it, that the king might be acquainted with the event of the battle as soon as might be. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king tidings, how that the LORD hath avenged him of his enemies.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>19–32.

This is the meaning of the Chethib &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;; the Masoretes, on the other hand, have substituted &#1493;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, which is the reading adopted in most of the ancient versions, and the one preferred by the majority of expositors: "if I weighed ... I would not," etc. But there is no necessity for this alteration, as the Chethib is quite in accordance with the character of the words. "For before our ears the king commanded" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-5.htm">2 Samuel 18:5</a>): &#1502;&#1497; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;, "take care whoever (it be) of the boy Absalom." On this use of &#1502;&#1497;, see Ewald, 104, d., a. The Keri &#1500;&#1497; is merely a conjecture, notwithstanding the fact that all the versions follow it, and that one of the Codices in Kennicott has &#1500;&#1497;. "or," continued the man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-13.htm">2 Samuel 18:13</a>), "should I have acted deceitfully towards his life (i.e., have slain him secretly, which he calls &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1512;, cheating, because it was opposed to the king's open command): and nothing remains hidden from the king; ... thou wouldst have set thyself in opposition to me," i.e., have risen up against me before the king. The middle clause is a circumstantial one, as the fact that &#1493;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512; is placed first clearly shows; so that it cannot be regarded as introducing the apodosis, which really follows in the clause commencing with &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;. </body></html>
