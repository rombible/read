Absalom would have only David smitten; David would have only Absalom spared. This seems to be a resemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, of which it is hard to say which is most amazing.

Which desire proceeded, partly, from his great indulgence towards his children; partly, from David’s consciousness that he himself was the meritorious and procuring cause of this rebellion, Absalom being given up to it for the punishment of David’s sins, and therefore did indeed deserve some pity from him; partly, from the consideration of his youth, which commonly makes men foolish, and heady, and violent, and subject to ill counsels; and partly, from his piety, being loth that he should be cut off in the act of his sin without any space or means for repentance, whereby both his soul and body would be in danger to perish for ever. All the people, to wit, the citizens and others who stood with the king in the gate when the army marched forth. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and Ittai,.... His three generals, to whom he had committed his army divided into three parts: <p>saying, deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom; he does not call him his son, being in rebellion against him, but the young man, who was young, and rash, and foolish, and so to be pitied; his request is, that they would spare him, and not take away his life, when in their power; that they would not aim at him, and push him hard, and fall upon him with wrath and fury; but if he fell into their hands, to take him alive, and bring him away, and not put him to death. This flowed from a natural affection to him, and a concern for the welfare of his soul, that he might not die in this sin; and also from a consciousness that it was for his own sins that he was raised up to rebel against him; and he seems to speak as if he was certain that the battle would go for him, and against Absalom; and which he might conclude from the answer of prayer he had in defeating the counsel of Ahithophel: <p>and all the people heard when he gave all the captains charge concerning Absalom; not only the three generals, but all the captains of hundreds and thousands, and this was heard by the common soldiers as well as by the people of the city that were spectators on this occasion, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-12.htm">2 Samuel 18:12</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.

So in ver. 12 the man says to Joab, "In our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai," etc. It does not follow that each one heard the sound of the king's voice, but only that the command was given publicly again and again, and in the presence of the army. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David came to Mahanaim, some of the wealthier citizens of the land to the east of the Jordan supplied the men who were with him with provisions. This is mentioned as the first sign that the people had not all fallen away from David, but that some of the more distinguished men were still firm in their adherence. Shobi, the son of Nahash or Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), was possibly a son of Nahash the deceased king of the Ammonites, and brother of Hanun, who was defeated by David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-2</a>), and one of those to whom David had shown favour and kindness when Rabbah was taken. At the same time, it is also quite possible that Shobi may have been an Israelite, who was merely living in the capital of the Ammonites, which had been incorporated into the kingdom of David, as it is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Nahash was not an uncommon name among the Israelites. Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>), and Barsillai of Roglim the Gileadite. Roglim was a town in Gilead, which is only mentioned once again, viz., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32</a>, and of which nothing further is known. They brought "bedding, basins, earthenware, and wheat, barley, meal, and parched grains, beans, lentils and parched." The position of the verb, which is not placed between the subject and the object of the sentence, but only at the close of the whole series of objects, is certainly unusual; but this does not warrant any alteration of the text. For if we were to supply a verb before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, as having fallen out of the text, it would be necessary, since &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; follows without a copula, to divide the things enumerated into two classes, so as to connect one portion of the objects with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, which is obviously unnatural. The early translators who interpolate a verb before the objects have therefore also supplied the copula w before &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. There is still less ground for supplying the number 10, as having dropped out before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, as the lxx have done, since none of the translators of the other ancient versions had any such reading. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, couch or bed, is used here for bedding. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, basins, probably field-kettles. The repetition of &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497; is very striking; nevertheless the second must not be struck out without further ground as a supposed copyist's error. As they not only ate parched ears or grains of wheat (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), but were also in the habit of drying pulse, pease, and lentils before eating them (vid., Harmar, Beobachtungen, i. pp. 255-6), the second &#1511;&#1500;&#1497; may be understood as referring to parched pulse. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; signifies, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins, cheese of oxen (i.e., of cows), and according to the conjecture of Roediger (Ges. Thes. p. 1462), a peculiar kind of cheese, such as the Aeneze in the province of Nedjid still make,<p>(Note: According to Burckhardt's account (Die Beduinen, p. 48), "after they have taken the butter from the butter-milk, they beat the latter again till it coagulates, and then dry it till it is quite hard. It is then rubbed to pieces, and in the spring every family stores up two or three lasts of it, which they eat mixed with butter.")<p>and for which the term &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; retained by the lxx was probably the technical name. Theodotus, on the other hand, has &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, milch-calves; and the Vulgate pingues vitulos, - both of them renderings which can certainly be sustained from the Arabic usage of speech, and would be more in accordance with the situation of the words, viz., after &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for they said (or thought) the people have become hungry and faint and thirty in the desert," i.e., in their flight to Mahanaim. </body></html>
