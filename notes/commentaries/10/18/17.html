Such cairns were used as memorials of any event deemed worthy of lasting remembrance, but the similar cairn piled over the dead body of Achan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-26.htm">Joshua 7:26</a>) makes it probable that the act was also intended as a sign of condemnation of Absalom's conduct. <span class="cmt_word">All Israel fled every one to his tent.</span> The Israelites were still a pastoral people, with tents for their abodes, though houses were gradually taking their place. The cry, "To your tents, O Israel!" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>), meant, "Go away to your homes!" and not "Gather for war!" It is remarkable how constantly Absalom's followers are described as "Israel" while the loyal men are "David's  servants." Absalom's was evidently the popular cause, and, besides Uriah's murder, there must have been political reasons for discontent at work to make David's government so distasteful. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>A man (one of David's men) saw him in this situation, and told Joab, Joab replied (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-11.htm">2 Samuel 18:11</a>), "Behold, thou hast seen it, and wherefore has thou not smitten him there to the ground? and it was for me to give thee ten silverlings and a girdle;" i.e., if thou hadst slain him, it would have been my duty to reward thee. </body></html>
