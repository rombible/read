Of the human causes of the victory nothing is told. We may assume that the advantage of thorough military organisation and generalship was on David’s side; but, in addition to this, was the vast power of the <span class= "ital">right, </span>the prestige of law and authority.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-8 How does David render good for evil! Absalom would have only David smitten; David would have only Absalom spared. This seems to be a resemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, of which it is hard to say which is most amazing.

But on the other hand it seems certain that the scene of this battle was on the east of Jordan. It seems therefore inevitable to conclude that some portion of the thick wood of oaks and terebinths which still runs down to the Jordan on the east side was for some reason called "the wood of Ephraim," either because it was a continuation on the east side of the great Ephraimitic forests on the west, or because of some transaction there in which Ephraim had taken part, such as the slaughter of the Midianites <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24-25</a>, or their own slaughter <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. the people of Israel were slain&#8212;This designation, together with the immense slaughter mentioned later, shows the large extent to which the people were enlisted in this unhappy civil contest.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The people of Israel, </span> i.e. the soldiers of Absalom; so called, partly to note that all Israel (some few excepted) were engaged in this rebellion, which made David’s deliverance more glorious and remarkable; and partly in opposition to David’s men, who, as to the main body, or most considerable part, were of the tribe of Judah, or had followed him from Judah. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Where the people of Israel were slain before the servants of David,....

The people opposed in the most decided manner the wish of the king to go with them to the war, saying (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-3.htm">2 Samuel 18:3</a>), "Thou shalt not go out: for if we flee, they will take no heed of us (i.e., attach no importance to this); and if half of us die, they will take no heed of us: for thou art as ten thousand of us (we must evidently read &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, and &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; has merely got into the text in consequence of &#1493;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; following): and now it is good that thou be ready to give us help from the city" (the Chethib &#1500;&#1506;&#1494;&#1497;&#1512;, inf.

David was to stay behind in the city with a reserve, that he might be able to come to their relief in case of need. </body></html>
