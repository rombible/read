The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence, or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Cushi - "The Cushite," a foreign slave, perhaps of Joab's, whom he did not scruple to expose to David's anger. If, however, it is a name, it must be rendered "Haccushi."

Then said Ahimaaz &#8230; Let me &#8230; run and bear the king tidings&#8212;The reasons why Joab declined to accept Ahimaaz' offer to bear intelligence of the victory to David, and afterwards let him go along with another, are variously stated by commentators&#8212;but they are of no importance. Yet the alacrity of the messengers, as well as the eager excitement of the expectants, is graphically described.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">My son; </span> so he calls him with respect both to his younger years, and to that true and tender affection which he had for him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab,....
