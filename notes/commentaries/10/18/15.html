Being a violation of the expressed wish, as well as of all the fond paternal feelings of David, it must have been deeply offensive to the king, nor was it ever forgotten (1Ki 2:5); and yet there is the strongest reason for believing that Joab, in doing it, was actuated by a sincere regard to the interests of David, both as a man and a monarch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Judging that there could be no safety to the king, nor peace to the kingdom, nor security to himself, and all David’s friends and loyal subjects, and good men, if Absalom had lived, as may seem probable from <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-10.htm" title="And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, is dead in battle.

But whether Joab did well in this, all things considered, I shall not here determine. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And ten young men that bare Joab's armour,....

Joab in this disobeyed the king's order, but provided for the good of the nation, and the safety of the king. The Jews observe (m), that measure for measure was given to Absalom; he was proud of his hair, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-25.htm">2 Samuel 14:25</a>, and therefore was hanged by it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-9.htm">2 Samuel 18:9</a>; he lay with ten concubines of his father, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/16-21.htm">2 Samuel 16:21</a>, and therefore was smitten with ten lances or spears by ten young men; and he stole three hearts, the heart of his father, the heart of the sanhedrim, and the heart of the men of Israel, and therefore three darts were fixed in him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-14.htm">2 Samuel 18:14</a>. <p>(m) Misn.
