His act was simply murder. In a lawless age it was defensible as the one act which terminated the rebellion and made a renewal of it impossible, and destroyed a traitor and would-be parricide who was likely otherwise to escape punishment; but it was a distinct disobedience of express orders, and Joab’s taking the execution into his own hands was wilful and deliberate murder.<p><span class= "bld">Three darts.</span>—The word means a <span class= "ital">rod </span>or <span class= "ital">staff. </span>Also the word <span class= "ital">heart </span>is the same as the following word <span class= "ital">midst, </span>and is not therefore to be taken too literally. Joab seized such sticks as were at hand in the wood and thrust them into Absalom, giving him most painful and probably mortal wounds, but not instantly killing him. Then (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2Samuel 18:15</a>) the ten men who had Joab’s armour and weapons came up and finally killed Absalom.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/18-14.htm" title="Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with you.

For he thought that some unquiet people, who were deeply engaged in this rebellion, would soon take occasion to move new disturbances to set him on the throne, which Absalom would be very ready to encourage. Therefore, knowing that he had been guilty of several crimes which the law of God made capital, especially of committing incest with his father’s concubines, and raising an unnatural rebellion against him, with a design to rob him both of his kingdom and his life; Joab did, not as David commanded, but as, he imagined, he ought to have commanded. “Thus fell,” says Delaney, “this cruel, this murderous, this incestuous parricide! and with him, twenty thousand of his rebel adherents.” So much mischief may one restless, interested man do in his country! and such ruin may his ambition bring upon it! We do not, however, intend, by these observations, to plead Joab’s justification in the act of direct disobedience to his sovereign’s orders, but leave the reader to form his own judgment of the matter.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:9-18 Let young people look upon Absalom, hanging on a tree, accursed, forsaken of heaven and earth; there let them read the Lord's abhorrence of rebellion against parents.

Being a violation of the expressed wish, as well as of all the fond paternal feelings of David, it must have been deeply offensive to the king, nor was it ever forgotten (1Ki 2:5); and yet there is the strongest reason for believing that Joab, in doing it, was actuated by a sincere regard to the interests of David, both as a man and a monarch.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I may not tarry thus with thee; </span> I must not lose time in contending with thee till I let the occasion slip. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Through the heart of Absalom; </span> not properly so called, for he was yet alive after these wounds, and was slain, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2 Samuel 18:15</a></span>; but through his middle, as the word heart is oft used, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm" title="Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the middle of the sea;">Psalm 46:2</a></span>, and that too not exactly, but more largely understood, as <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm" title="And you came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the middle of heaven, with darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.">Deu 4:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm" title="Your borders are in the middle of the seas, your builders have perfected your beauty.">Ezekiel 27:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-40.htm" title="For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.">Matthew 12:40</a></span>; or through his body; which might be, and yet the wounds not mortal. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">While he was yet alive, </span> or, <span class="ital">yet he continued alive</span>, i.e. the darts did not despatch him, and therefore they smite him again, and kill him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2 Samuel 18:15</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee,....

The weapons of the ancients were of a very inferior kind, and stakes sharpened at the end and hardened in the fire were used by the infantry, until the increasing cheapness of iron made it possible to supply them with pikes. Joab's act was not one of intentional cruelty, but, picking up the first weapons that came to hand, he hurried away to kill his victim. His thrusts with these pointed sticks were brutal, and inflicted mortal wounds; but as they were not immediately fatal, Joab's armour bearers, who had followed him, and who had with them Joab's own better weapons, were called upon to put an end to Absalom's sufferings. <span class="cmt_word">His heart</span> does not mean that organ anatomically, but the middle of his body.
