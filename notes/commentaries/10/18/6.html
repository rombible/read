Yet it is plain that the battle must have been on that side of the river for the following reasons: (1) both armies were on that side beforehand, and there is no mention of their crossing; (2) David remained in Mahanaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/18-3.htm" title="But the people answered, You shall not go forth: for if we flee away, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care for us: but now you are worth ten thousand of us: therefore now it is better that you succor us out of the city.">2Samuel 18:3-4</a>) with the reserves, for the purpose of succouring the army in case of need; (3) he there received the news of Absalom’s death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2Samuel 18:24-33</a>); (4) the army returned thither after the battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-3.htm" title="And the people got them by stealth that day into the city, as people being ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.">2Samuel 19:3</a>); and (5) David was obliged to cross the Jordan on his final return to Jerusalem, and was met at the crossing by the tribes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-15.htm" title="And ten young men that bore Joab's armor compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.">2Samuel 18:15</a>, &c.). There is really no difficulty but such as arises from our ignorance of local names.

It seems therefore inevitable to conclude that some portion of the thick wood of oaks and terebinths which still runs down to the Jordan on the east side was for some reason called "the wood of Ephraim," either because it was a continuation on the east side of the great Ephraimitic forests on the west, or because of some transaction there in which Ephraim had taken part, such as the slaughter of the Midianites <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/7-24.htm">Judges 7:24-25</a>, or their own slaughter <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm">Judges 12:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. wood of Ephraim&#8212;This wood, of course, was on the east of Jordan.

These considerations make it all but certain that “the wood of Ephraim” was some part of the great forests of Gilead. The origin of the name can only be conjectured. It may possibly have been derived from the connexion of Ephraim with the trans-Jordanic Manasseh, or from some incident such as the slaughter of the Ephraimites by Jephthah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-6.htm" title="Then said they to him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right.

It might mean the large forest tract in the highlands of Ephraim; but if so, the battle must have been fought on the west of the Jordan, whereas the general tenor of the narrative makes it plain that it took place on the eastern side, near Mahanaim. It is true that no wood of Ephraim is ever mentioned elsewhere in the Bible as situated in Gilead, and those who cannot believe in such a wood except within the borders of the tribe, argue that, after the three divisions had marched out to battle, there was long skirmishing, in which Absalom drew David's men across the Jordan, and there gave battle. But Absalom's army was evidently surprised, and as we are told that "he pitched in the land of Gilead" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-26.htm">2 Samuel 17:26</a>), for him to have retired would have been a confession of weakness; and Joab, after seeing him cross the Jordan, would not have followed him, but let this retrograde movement have its effect upon his followers. Such a movement is absolutely incredible on the part of an army at least three times as numerous as those whom they attacked, and confident of victory. Moreover, armies in those days were not composed of men receiving pay, and bound to remain with their colours, but of yeomen unwilling to be kept long absent from their farms, and liable, therefore, rapidly to melt away. A quick decision was plainly necessary for Absalom, while David could afford to wait. But besides this, when his forces moved out of Mahanaim, David took his post at the gate with the reserves, and he was still there, sitting "between the two gates," when news was  brought him of the victory (ver. 24). The only real argument in support of the view that the battle was fought on the west of the Jordan is that "Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain" (ver. 23), Hebrew, the <span class="accented">kikkar -</span> a name specially given to the valley of the Jordan near Jericho. But then Cushi must also have run through the same valley, and it is evident that his route was in this very respect different from that taken by Ahimaaz. Really, <span class="accented">kikkar</span>, which in Hebrew means "circuit," may be used of the country round any city, and is applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-28.htm">Nehemiah 12:28</a> to the environs of Jerusalem. Here the meaning probably is that, while the Cushite took the route back over the battlefield through the wood, Ahimaaz went to the left of it, over the more level ground, nearer the Jordan. And though the name is chiefly used of that part near Jericho, it was probably applied popularly to every stretch of level ground near the river. This argument, therefore, is inconclusive; while, on the other side, it is plain that David's army returned that same day to Mahanaim, that they knew at once of his distress, and that they were beginning to steal away home when Joab made David come forth to thank them, and encourage them to remain with him. The most probable explanation of the difficulty is that "the wood of Ephraim" was so called because it was the spot where Jephthah defeated the Ephraimites when they invaded Gilead to punish him for daring to go to war without their consent, they being then the dominant tribe, to whose arbitrament belonged all imperial matters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/12-4.htm">Judges 12:4-6</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>When David came to Mahanaim, some of the wealthier citizens of the land to the east of the Jordan supplied the men who were with him with provisions. This is mentioned as the first sign that the people had not all fallen away from David, but that some of the more distinguished men were still firm in their adherence. Shobi, the son of Nahash or Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), was possibly a son of Nahash the deceased king of the Ammonites, and brother of Hanun, who was defeated by David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-2</a>), and one of those to whom David had shown favour and kindness when Rabbah was taken. At the same time, it is also quite possible that Shobi may have been an Israelite, who was merely living in the capital of the Ammonites, which had been incorporated into the kingdom of David, as it is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Nahash was not an uncommon name among the Israelites. Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>), and Barsillai of Roglim the Gileadite. Roglim was a town in Gilead, which is only mentioned once again, viz., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32</a>, and of which nothing further is known. They brought "bedding, basins, earthenware, and wheat, barley, meal, and parched grains, beans, lentils and parched." The position of the verb, which is not placed between the subject and the object of the sentence, but only at the close of the whole series of objects, is certainly unusual; but this does not warrant any alteration of the text. For if we were to supply a verb before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, as having fallen out of the text, it would be necessary, since &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; follows without a copula, to divide the things enumerated into two classes, so as to connect one portion of the objects with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, which is obviously unnatural. The early translators who interpolate a verb before the objects have therefore also supplied the copula w before &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. There is still less ground for supplying the number 10, as having dropped out before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, as the lxx have done, since none of the translators of the other ancient versions had any such reading. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, couch or bed, is used here for bedding. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, basins, probably field-kettles. The repetition of &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497; is very striking; nevertheless the second must not be struck out without further ground as a supposed copyist's error. As they not only ate parched ears or grains of wheat (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), but were also in the habit of drying pulse, pease, and lentils before eating them (vid., Harmar, Beobachtungen, i. pp. 255-6), the second &#1511;&#1500;&#1497; may be understood as referring to parched pulse. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; signifies, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins, cheese of oxen (i.e., of cows), and according to the conjecture of Roediger (Ges. Thes. p. 1462), a peculiar kind of cheese, such as the Aeneze in the province of Nedjid still make,<p>(Note: According to Burckhardt's account (Die Beduinen, p. 48), "after they have taken the butter from the butter-milk, they beat the latter again till it coagulates, and then dry it till it is quite hard. It is then rubbed to pieces, and in the spring every family stores up two or three lasts of it, which they eat mixed with butter.")<p>and for which the term &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; retained by the lxx was probably the technical name. Theodotus, on the other hand, has &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, milch-calves; and the Vulgate pingues vitulos, - both of them renderings which can certainly be sustained from the Arabic usage of speech, and would be more in accordance with the situation of the words, viz., after &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for they said (or thought) the people have become hungry and faint and thirty in the desert," i.e., in their flight to Mahanaim. </body></html>
