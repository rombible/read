He speaks of him tenderly as “the young man” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-5.htm" title="And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with Absalom.

Absalom would have only David smitten; David would have only Absalom spared. This seems to be a resemblance of man's wickedness towards God, and God's mercy to man, of which it is hard to say which is most amazing.

A pitched battle was now inevitable. But so much depending on the life of the king, he was not allowed to take the field in person; and he therefore divided his forces into three detachments under Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, the commander of the foreign guards.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">By the gate side, </span> i.e. <span class="ital">between the two gates of the city</span>, as it is expressed below, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm" title="And David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the roof over the gate to the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold a man running alone.">2 Samuel 18:24</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king said unto them, what seemeth you best I will do,....

This is mentioned as the first sign that the people had not all fallen away from David, but that some of the more distinguished men were still firm in their adherence. Shobi, the son of Nahash or Rabbah, the capital of the Ammonites (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-1.htm">2 Samuel 11:1</a>), was possibly a son of Nahash the deceased king of the Ammonites, and brother of Hanun, who was defeated by David (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1-2</a>), and one of those to whom David had shown favour and kindness when Rabbah was taken. At the same time, it is also quite possible that Shobi may have been an Israelite, who was merely living in the capital of the Ammonites, which had been incorporated into the kingdom of David, as it is evident from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-25.htm">2 Samuel 17:25</a> that Nahash was not an uncommon name among the Israelites. Machir the son of Ammiel of Lodebar (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/9-4.htm">2 Samuel 9:4</a>), and Barsillai of Roglim the Gileadite. Roglim was a town in Gilead, which is only mentioned once again, viz., in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-32.htm">2 Samuel 19:32</a>, and of which nothing further is known. They brought "bedding, basins, earthenware, and wheat, barley, meal, and parched grains, beans, lentils and parched." The position of the verb, which is not placed between the subject and the object of the sentence, but only at the close of the whole series of objects, is certainly unusual; but this does not warrant any alteration of the text. For if we were to supply a verb before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, as having fallen out of the text, it would be necessary, since &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; follows without a copula, to divide the things enumerated into two classes, so as to connect one portion of the objects with &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, which is obviously unnatural. The early translators who interpolate a verb before the objects have therefore also supplied the copula w before &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;. There is still less ground for supplying the number 10, as having dropped out before &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489; and &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, as the lxx have done, since none of the translators of the other ancient versions had any such reading. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;, couch or bed, is used here for bedding. &#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, basins, probably field-kettles. The repetition of &#1493;&#1511;&#1500;&#1497; is very striking; nevertheless the second must not be struck out without further ground as a supposed copyist's error. As they not only ate parched ears or grains of wheat (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/2-14.htm">Leviticus 2:14</a>), but were also in the habit of drying pulse, pease, and lentils before eating them (vid., Harmar, Beobachtungen, i. pp. 255-6), the second &#1511;&#1500;&#1497; may be understood as referring to parched pulse. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512; &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; signifies, according to the Chaldee and the Rabbins, cheese of oxen (i.e., of cows), and according to the conjecture of Roediger (Ges. Thes. p. 1462), a peculiar kind of cheese, such as the Aeneze in the province of Nedjid still make,<p>(Note: According to Burckhardt's account (Die Beduinen, p. 48), "after they have taken the butter from the butter-milk, they beat the latter again till it coagulates, and then dry it till it is quite hard. It is then rubbed to pieces, and in the spring every family stores up two or three lasts of it, which they eat mixed with butter.")<p>and for which the term &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x3c9;&#768;&#x3b8; &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd; retained by the lxx was probably the technical name. Theodotus, on the other hand, has &#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, milch-calves; and the Vulgate pingues vitulos, - both of them renderings which can certainly be sustained from the Arabic usage of speech, and would be more in accordance with the situation of the words, viz., after &#1510;&#1488;&#1503;. &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, "for they said (or thought) the people have become hungry and faint and thirty in the desert," i.e., in their flight to Mahanaim. </body></html>
