The more our hearts are fixed and enlarged, in thanksgiving to God for our mercies, the better disposed we shall be to bear with patience the afflictions mixed with them. Some think David's wish arose from concern about Absalom's everlasting state; but he rather seems to have spoken without due thought. He is to be blamed for showing so great fondness for a graceless son. Also for quarrelling with Divine justice. And for opposing the justice of the nation, which, as king, he had to administer, and which ought to be preferred before natural affection. The best men are not always in a good frame; we are apt to over-grieve for what we over-loved. But while we learn from this example to watch and pray against sinful indulgence, or neglect of our children, may we not, in David, perceive a shadow of the Saviour's love, who wept over, prayed for, and even suffered death for mankind, though vile rebels and enemies.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The plain - The floor of the valley through which the Jordan runs. The Cushite did not run by that road, but took the road over the hills, which may well have been the shorter but also the more difficult road. The two roads would probably meet a short distance from Mahanaim. These words, which have been thought to prove that the battle took place on the west of Jordan, are a clear proof that it took place on the east, because if the runners had had to cross the Jordan, they must both have come by the same road, which it is clear they did not. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>24-32. David sat between the two gates&#8212;that is, in the tower-house on the wall that overhung the gate of Mahanaim. Near it was a watchtower, on which a sentinel was posted, as in times of war, to notify every occurrence. The delicacy of Ahimaaz' communication was made up by the unmistakable plainness of Cushi's. The death of Absalom was a heavy trial, and it is impossible not to sympathize with the outburst of feeling by which David showed that all thoughts of the victory he had won as a king were completely sunk in the painful loss he had sustained as a father. The extraordinary ardor and strength of his affection for this worthless son break out in the redundancy and vehemence of his mournful ejaculations.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Between the two gates; </span> for the gates of the cities then were, as now they are, large and thick; and, for the greater security, had two gates, one more outward, the other inward.

The &#1500;&#1511;&#1495; before &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489; is apparently pleonastic; but it belongs to the diffuse and circumstantial character of the antiquated Hebrew diction (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-1.htm">Numbers 16:1</a>). &#1502;&#1510;&#1468;&#1489;&#1514;, a memorial of stone; whether in the form of a column, or an obelisk, or a monolith, cannot be determined (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-22.htm">Genesis 28:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-52.htm">Genesis 31:52</a>). The king's valley, which received its name from the event narrated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/14-17.htm">Genesis 14:17</a>, was two stadia from Jerusalem according to Josephus (Ant. vii. 10, 3), and therefore not "close to the Dead Sea," or in regione transjordanensi (Ges. Thes. pp. 1045, 1377), or "in the Jordan valley in Ephraim" (Tuch and Winer). It was on the eastern side of Jerusalem, in the Kidron valley; though Absalom's pillar, which ecclesiastical tradition has transferred thither, a monument about forty feet in height and pointed like a pyramid, is not of early Hebrew, but of Grecian origin. On the words "I have no son," see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/14-27.htm">2 Samuel 14:27</a>. </body></html>
