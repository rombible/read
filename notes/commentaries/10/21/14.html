But the Lord will plead the cause of those who cannot or will not avenge themselves; and the prayers of the poor are of great power. When God sent rain to water the earth, these bodies were buried, for then it appeared that God was entreated for the land. When justice is done on earth, vengeance from heaven ceases. God is pacified, and is entreated for us through Christ, who was hanged on a tree, and so made a curse for us, to do away our guilt, though he was himself guiltless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the street of Beth-shan - This was the wide place just inside the gate of an Oriental city, bounded therefore by the city wall (compare the marginal reference).

As it is expressly said in ver. 13 that these bones were collected, we cannot doubt but that the remains of the seven grandsons were interred with those of Saul and Jonathan, in the tomb of Kish, their common ancestor. But whether the Septuagint has preserved words that have dropped out of the Hebrew text, or has added them to make the fact plain, is more than we can answer. <span class="cmt_word">Zelah</span>.

The name of Michal, which stands in the text, is founded upon an error of memory or a copyist's mistake; for it was not Michal, but Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, who was given to Adriel the Meholathite as his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm">1 Samuel 18:19</a>). The Gibeonites crucified those who were delivered up to them upon the mountain at Gibeah before Jehovah (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>). "Thus fell seven at once." The Chethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, at which the Masoretes took such offence that they wanted to change it into &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, is defended by Bttcher very properly, on the ground that the dual of the numeral denotes what is uniformly repeated as if by pairing; so that here it expresses what was extraordinary in the even tin a more pictorial manner than the Keri: "They fell sevenfold at once," i.e., seven in the same way. The further remark, "they were slain in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest," belongs to what follows, for which it prepares the way. The two Keris, &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;, are needless emendations. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; is an adverbial accusative (vid., Ges. 118, 2). The harvest began with the barley harvest, about the middle of Nisan, our April.</body></html>
