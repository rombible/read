From the latter part of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-17.htm" title="But Abishai the son of Zeruiah succored him, and smote the Philistine, and killed him.

It is probably taken from some history of David's wars, apparently the same as furnished the materials for <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>; 8; 23:8-39. There is no direct clue to the time when the events here related took place, but it was probably quite in the early part of David's reign, while he was still young and active, after the war described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5.htm">2 Samuel 5</a>. The Book of Chronicles places these Philistine battles immediately after the taking of Rabbah of the Ammonites <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, but omits David's adventure <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-15.htm">2 Samuel 21:15-17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15-22. Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel&#8212;Although the Philistines had completely succumbed to the army of David, yet the appearance of any gigantic champions among them revived their courage and stirred them up to renewed inroads on the Hebrew territory. Four successive contests they provoked during the latter period of David's reign, in the first of which the king ran so imminent a risk of his life that he was no longer allowed to encounter the perils of the battlefield.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> These wars, though here related, were transacted long before this time: of which <span class="bld">See Poole "<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD.

Besides what is before recorded in this and the preceding book; being animated to it partly by the number of giants among them, and partly by the decline of David's life, and it may be chiefly by the insurrections and rebellions in Israel; though some think that these battles were not after the rebellions of Absalom and Sheba, and the affair of the Gibeonites, though here recorded; but before, and quickly after the war with the Ammonites, next to which they are placed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-1.htm">1 Chronicles 20:1</a>; but they seem to be placed here in their proper order: <p>and David went down, and his servants with him; to the borders of the Philistines, perceiving they were preparing to make war against him: <p>and fought against the Philistines; engaged in a battle with them: <p>and David waxed faint; in the battle, not able to bear the fatigues of war, and wield his armour as he had used, being in the decline of life; after he had been engaged a while, his spirits began to fail, not through fear, but through feebleness; but, according to Josephus, it was through weariness in pursuing the enemy put to flight, which the following person perceived, and turned upon him (y). <p>(y) Antiqu. l. 7. c. 12. sect. 1.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel; and David went down, and his servants with him, and fought against the Philistines: and David waxed faint.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">15</span>. <span class="ital">had yet war again</span>] “Again” refers to earlier wars, the account of which preceded this narrative in the document from which it was taken.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">went down</span>] From the high lands of Judah to the low country of Philistia—the <span class="ital">Shephêlah</span> or maritime plain.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>15–22. Heroic exploits in the Philistine wars<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This section is quite unconnected with the preceding narrative. It is perhaps a fragment from some “book of golden deeds” recording the exploits of David and his warriors.

A new narrative begins here, and the heroic acts related in it are taken probably from some record of the martial deeds of David and his mighties. We have already seen that the Book of Jasher (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-18.htm">2 Samuel 1:18</a>) was a national anthology, full of ballads and songs in praise of glorious exploits of Israel's worthies. The source of the narratives recorded here apparently was a history in prose, and commenced, perhaps, with David's own achievement in slaying Goliath - a deed which celled forth the heroism of the nation, and was emulated by other brave men. These extracts were probably given for their own sake, and are repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4-8</a>, where they are placed immediately after the capture of Rabbah; but they here form an appropriate introduction to the psalm of thanksgiving in ch. 22. It was usual in Hebrew, in making quotations, to leave them without any attempt at adapting them to their new place; and thus the "moreover" and "yet again," which referred to some previous narrative in the history, are left unchanged. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/2_samuel/21.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>David granted the request, because, according to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/35-33.htm">Numbers 35:33</a>, blood-guiltiness when resting upon the land could only be expiated by the blood of the criminal; but in delivering up the members of Saul's house for whom they asked, he spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, for the sake of the bond of friendship which he had formed with Jonathan on oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-3.htm">1 Samuel 18:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-8.htm">1 Samuel 20:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/20-16.htm">1 Samuel 20:16</a>), and gave up to the Gibeonites two sons of Rizpah, a concubine of Saul (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-11.htm">2 Samuel 21:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-7.htm">2 Samuel 3:7</a>), and five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel of Meholah. The name of Michal, which stands in the text, is founded upon an error of memory or a copyist's mistake; for it was not Michal, but Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, who was given to Adriel the Meholathite as his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm">1 Samuel 18:19</a>). The Gibeonites crucified those who were delivered up to them upon the mountain at Gibeah before Jehovah (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>). "Thus fell seven at once." The Chethib &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, at which the Masoretes took such offence that they wanted to change it into &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, is defended by Bttcher very properly, on the ground that the dual of the numeral denotes what is uniformly repeated as if by pairing; so that here it expresses what was extraordinary in the even tin a more pictorial manner than the Keri: "They fell sevenfold at once," i.e., seven in the same way. The further remark, "they were slain in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest," belongs to what follows, for which it prepares the way. The two Keris, &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;, are needless emendations. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; is an adverbial accusative (vid., Ges. 118, 2). The harvest began with the barley harvest, about the middle of Nisan, our April.</body></html>
