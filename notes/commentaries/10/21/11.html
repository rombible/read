But the Lord will plead the cause of those who cannot or will not avenge themselves; and the prayers of the poor are of great power. When God sent rain to water the earth, these bodies were buried, for then it appeared that God was entreated for the land. When justice is done on earth, vengeance from heaven ceases. God is pacified, and is entreated for us through Christ, who was hanged on a tree, and so made a curse for us, to do away our guilt, though he was himself guiltless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dropped - Rather, "poured," the proper word for heavy rain <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-33.htm">Exodus 9:33</a>. The "early rain," or heavy rain of autumn, usually began in October, so that Rizpah's devoted watch continued about six months. How rare rain was in harvest we learn from <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-17.htm">1 Samuel 12:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/26-1.htm">Proverbs 26:1</a>. The reason of the bodies being left unburied, contrary to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/21-23.htm">Deuteronomy 21:23</a>, probably was that the death of these men being an expiation of the guilt of a violated oath, they were to remain until the fall of rain should give the assurance that God's anger was appeased, and the national sin forgiven.<p>Birds of the air ... beasts of the field - It is well known how in the East, on the death e. g. of a camel in a caravan, the vultures instantly flock to the carcass.

Whether this was told out of good will or ill will is not certain; however, it was not disagreeable to David, but served to move pity and compassion in him to the woman, and to stir him up to give an honourable interment to Saul and his sons; and which would show that this fact was not done out of personal pique and revenge to his family, but in obedience to the will of God, and the honour of his name. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/2_samuel/21.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And it was told David what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/2_samuel/21.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>11–14.

The Chethib &#1500;&#1497; is not to be touched, notwithstanding the &#1500;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; which follows. The use of the singular may be explained on the simple ground that the speaker thought of the Gibeonites as a corporation. "And it does not pertain to us to put any one to death in Israel" (sc., of our own accord). When David inquired still further, "What do you mean, then, that I should do to you?" they replied, "(As for) the man who consumed us, and who thought against us, that we should be destroyed (&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; without &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, subordinately to &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, like &#1488;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; in the previous verse), so as not to continue in the whole of the territory of Israel, let seven men of his sons be given us, that we may crucify them to Jehovah at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Jehovah." &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; is placed at the head absolutely (cf. Gesenius, 145, 2). On crucifixion as a capital punishment, see at <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>, where it has already been observed that criminals were not impaled or fastened to the cross alive, but were first of all put to death. Consequently the Gibeonites desired that the massacre, which had taken place among them by the command of Saul, should be expiated by the execution of a number of his sons - blood for blood, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-31.htm">Numbers 35:31</a>. They asked for the crucifixion for Jehovah, i.e., that the persons executed might be impaled, as a public exhibition of the punishment inflicted, before the face of the Lord (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-9.htm">2 Samuel 21:9</a>), as the satisfaction required to expiate His wrath. Seven was a sacred number, denoting the performance of a work of God. This was to take place in Gibeah, the home and capital of Saul, who had brought the wrath of God upon the land through his crime. There is a sacred irony in the epithet applied to Saul, "chosen of the Lord." If Saul was the chosen of Jehovah, his actions ought to have been in accordance with his divine election.</body></html>
