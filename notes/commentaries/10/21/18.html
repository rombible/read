He therefore sent for the bones of Saul and Jonathan, which the men of Jabesh had taken away secretly from the wall of Beisan, where the Philistines had fastened the bodies, and which had been buried in Jabesh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>.), and had the bones of the sons and grandsons of Saul who had been crucified at Gibeah collected together, and interred all these bones at Zela in the land of Benjamin, in the family grave of Kish the father of Saul. &#1490;&#1468;&#1504;&#1468;&#1489;, to take away secretly. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1502;&#1468;&#1512;&#1495;&#1489;, from the market-place of Bethshan, does not present any contradiction to the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm">1 Samuel 31:10</a>, that the Philistines fastened the body to the wall of Bethshan, as the rechob or market-place in eastern towns is not in the middle of the town, but is an open place against or in front of the gate (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-6.htm">2 Chronicles 32:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-1.htm">Nehemiah 8:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-3.htm">Nehemiah 8:3</a>,<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/8-16.htm">Nehemiah 8:16</a>). This place, as the common meeting-place of the citizens, was the most suitable spot that the Philistines could find for fastening the bodies to the wall. The Chethib &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is the true Hebrew form from &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1492;, whereas the Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; is a formation resembling the Aramaean (cf. Ewald, 252, a.). The Keri &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is correct, however, as &#1508;&#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, being a proper name, does not take any article. In &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; the literal meaning of &#1497;&#1493;&#1501; (day) must not be strictly pressed, but the expression is to be taken in the sense of "at the time of the smiting;" for the hanging up of the bodies did not take place till the day after the battle (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-8.htm">1 Samuel 31:8</a>.). - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-14.htm">2 Samuel 21:14</a> the account is abridged, and the bones of the crucified persons are not mentioned again. The situation of Zela is unknown (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/18-28.htm">Joshua 18:28</a>). After this had been carried out in accordance with the king's command, God suffered himself to be entreated for the land, so that the famine ceased. </body></html>
