In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-10.htm" title="And they put his armor in the house of Ashtaroth: and they fastened his body to the wall of Bethshan.">1Samuel 31:10</a> it is said that the Philistines fastened the body of Saul “to the wall of Beth-shan;” here, that the men of Jabesh-gilead took them secretly from <span class= "ital">the street. </span>The two statements are quite consistent, for the exact place where the Philistines hung up to public view the body of the slain and defeated monarch was the broad space or square, just inside the gate, where the people were wont to gather; and it was from the same place that they were taken. Most MSS. of the LXX. add to the previous verse: “And they were taken down, and Dan the son of Joa, of the descendants of the giant, took them down.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-12.htm" title="And David went and took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the men of Jabeshgilead, which had stolen them from the street of Bethshan, where the Philistines had hanged them, when the Philistines had slain Saul in Gilboa:">2 Samuel 21:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">He defended it — </span>So that the Philistines could neither burn the corn, nor carry it away, nor tread it down. <span class="ital">The Lord wrought a great victory </span>— By his hand. How great soever the bravery of the instruments is, the praise of the achievement is to be given to God. These fought, but God wrought the victory. It must be observed that this Shammah, although one of the three most mighty men, is not particularly named in the book of Chronicles; it being the manner of the Scriptures, as the Jews observe, to notice that briefly in one place, which hath been explained at large in another; as this action of Shammah is here in this book.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:10-14 That a guilty land should enjoy many years of plenty, calls for gratitude; and we need not wonder misused abundance should be punished with scarcity; yet how few are disposed to ask of the Lord concerning the sinful cause, while numbers search for the second causes by which he is pleased to work! But the Lord will plead the cause of those who cannot or will not avenge themselves; and the prayers of the poor are of great power. When God sent rain to water the earth, these bodies were buried, for then it appeared that God was entreated for the land. When justice is done on earth, vengeance from heaven ceases. God is pacified, and is entreated for us through Christ, who was hanged on a tree, and so made a curse for us, to do away our guilt, though he was himself guiltless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>From the street of Beth-shan - This was the wide place just inside the gate of an Oriental city, bounded therefore by the city wall (compare the marginal reference).

The name of Michal, which stands in the text, is founded upon an error of memory or a copyist's mistake; for it was not Michal, but Merab, Saul's eldest daughter, who was given to Adriel the Meholathite as his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-19.htm">1 Samuel 18:19</a>). The Gibeonites crucified those who were delivered up to them upon the mountain at Gibeah before Jehovah (see the remarks on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-6.htm">2 Samuel 21:6</a>).

The further remark, "they were slain in the first days of harvest, at the beginning of the barley harvest," belongs to what follows, for which it prepares the way. The two Keris, &#1493;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; for &#1493;&#1492;&#1501;, and &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;, are needless emendations. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514; is an adverbial accusative (vid., Ges. 118, 2). The harvest began with the barley harvest, about the middle of Nisan, our April.</body></html>
