The story of the Gibeonites and of Joshua’s league with them is told in Joshua 9, but Saul’s attempt to destroy them is mentioned only here. It is plain, from what is said of them in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-8.htm" title="But the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth; and the five sons of Michal the daughter of Saul, whom she brought up for Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite:">2Samuel 21:8</a>, that they had never become incorporated with the Israelites by circumcision, but remained a distinct people. Saul’s sin consisted in the violation of the solemn oath, in the Lord’s name, by which the nation of Israel was bound to the Gibeonites. “His zeal” in that case was of the same ungodly character with many other acts of his reign, in which pride, arrogance, and self-will were cloaked under a zeal for God’s honour and His people’s welfare.<p><span class= "bld">The Amorites.</span>—More precisely, the Gibeonites were <span class= "ital">Hivites </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm" title="And the men of Israel said to the Hivites, Peradventure you dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?">Joshua 9:7</a>); but they are called Amorites (=<span class= "ital">mountaineers</span>) as a frequent general name for the old people of Palestine.<p>Two questions are often asked in connection with this narrative: (1) Why the punishment of Saul’s sin should have been so long delayed? and (2) why it should at last have fallen upon David and his people, who had no share in the commission of the sin? The answer to both questions is in the fact that Israel both sinned and was punished <span class= "ital">as a nation. </span>Saul slew the Gibeonites, not simply as the son of Kish, but as the king of Israel, and therefore involved all Israel with him in the violation of the national oath; and hence, until the evil should be put away by the execution of the immediate offender or his representatives, all Israel must suffer. The lesson of the continuity of the nation’s life, and of its continued responsibility from age to age, was greatly enhanced by the delay. Besides this, there were so many other grievous sins for which Saul was to be punished, that it was hardly possible to bring out during his lifetime the special Divine displeasure at this one.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/2_samuel/21.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-2.htm" title="And the king called the Gibeonites, and said to them; (now the Gibeonites were not of the children of Israel, but of the remnant of the Amorites; and the children of Israel had sworn to them: and Saul sought to slay them in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah.)">2 Samuel 21:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">In his zeal for the children of Israel and Judah — </span>When Joshua and the princes made a league with the Gibeonites, the people were greatly offended with them, as appears, Joshua chap. 9. Whatever the pretences of this resentment might be, the true reason seems sufficiently apparent; they were, by this league, deprived of the lands and spoils of the Gibeonites. Did these reasons cease in the days of Saul? Or rather, did they not still subsist, and with more force, in proportion as the people of Israel and their wants increased, in a narrow land? But however this may be, why did Saul slay them? The text plainly saith, that he did it in his <span class="ital">zeal for the children of Israel and Judah. </span>But the question still returns: How could the destroying these poor people manifest his zeal for Israel and Judah? There is seemingly but one imaginable way how this could be done. The Gibeonites had one city in the tribe of Judah, and three in Benjamin; and when they were destroyed out of these cities, who could pretend any right to them but Israel (that is, Benjamin) and Judah? So that Saul destroyed the Gibeonites, as the most obliging thing he could do for his people.

God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The way in which the writer here refers to the history of the league with the Gibeonites <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/9.htm">Joshua 9</a> shows that the Book of Joshua was not a part of the same work as the Books of Samuel.<p>Of the Amorites - The Gibeonites were Hivites <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-7.htm">Joshua 9:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-19.htm">Joshua 11:19</a>; and in many enumerations of the Canaanite nations the Hivites are distinguished from the Amorites. But "Amorite" is often used in a more comprehensive sense, equivalent to "Canaanite" (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm">Genesis 15:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-27.htm">Deuteronomy 1:27</a>), and denoting especially that part of the Canaanite nation which dwelt in the hill country <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-29.htm">Numbers 13:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-7.htm">Deuteronomy 1:7</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-20.htm">Deuteronomy 1:20</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-24.htm">Deuteronomy 1:24</a>, and so includes the Hivites. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/2_samuel/21.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. in his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah&#8212;Under pretense of a rigorous and faithful execution of the divine law regarding the extermination of the Canaanites, he set himself to expel or destroy those whom Joshua had been deceived into sparing. His real object seems to have been, that the possessions of the Gibeonites, being forfeited to the crown, might be divided among his own people (compare 1Sa 22:7). At all events, his proceeding against this people was in violation of a solemn oath, and involving national guilt. The famine was, in the wise and just retribution of Providence, made a national punishment, since the Hebrews either assisted in the massacre, or did not interpose to prevent it; since they neither endeavored to repair the wrong, nor expressed any horror of it; and since a general protracted chastisement might have been indispensable to inspire a proper respect and protection to the Gibeonite remnant that survived.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Saul sought to slay them, </span> i. e. he sought occasions and pretences how he might cut them off with some colour of law or justice, diligently searching out and aggravating their faults, and punishing them worse than they deserved; oppressing them with excessive labours, and openly killing some of them, and intending by degrees to wear them out. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In his zeal to the children of Israel and Judah; </span> conceiving, or rather pretending, that it was not for the honour, nor comfort, nor advantage of God’s people, to nourish any of that viperous broad in their bosoms; and that howsoever Joshua and the princes which then were, had by their fraud been drawn into an oath to preserve them, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/9-15.htm" title="And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them, to let them live: and the princes of the congregation swore to them.">Joshua 9:15</a></span>, yet in truth that oath was contrary to God’s command, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-32.htm" title="You shall make no covenant with them, nor with their gods.">Exodus 23:32</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-2.htm" title="And when the LORD your God shall deliver them before you; you shall smite them, and utterly destroy them; you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them:">Deu 7:2</a></span>, and therefore (as he thought) not to be observed. This was his pretence. But how little zeal he had for God, or for the public good of his people, is evident by the whole course of his life; and therefore it is more than probable he had some particular motive or design in the case; either because some of them had highly provoked him, for whose sake he would be revenged of the whole race; or because, they being cut off, their estates might be forfeited to the crown; or for some other reason now unknown. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the king called the Gibeonites,....
