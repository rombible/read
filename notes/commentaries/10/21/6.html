Saul being dead, his male descendants were considered as standing in his place, representing him, and responsible for his acts, just as is largely the case in legal affairs and matters of property at the present day. The number <span class= "ital">seven </span>is, doubtless, fixed upon as being first, a considerable and sufficient number; and then, on account of its sacred associations, and as the representative of completeness.<p><span class= "bld">We will hang them up.</span>—The sons of Saul are only to be given up by David; their actual execution is to be by the Gibeonites, and the method is that of <span class= "ital">hanging </span>or fastening to a stake, either by impaling or by crucifixion, the word being used for both methods of execution.<p><span class= "bld">Unto the Lord</span>—i.e., publicly. (Comp. a similar expression in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.">Numbers 25:4</a>.) The sin had been outrageous; its punishment must be conspicuous. The place of execution is fitly chosen in the home of Saul. It seems strange that he should be here spoken of as “the Lord’s chosen;” but this and the expression “unto the Lord” go together; what Saul had done he had done as the head of the theocracy, as God’s chosen ruler, and now his family must be punished in the presence of Him against whom he had offended—“before the Lord.” The idea of regarding the execution of these men as a propitiatory human sacrifice is utterly destitute of any shadow of support.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>21:1-9 Every affliction arises from sin, and should lead us to repent and humble ourselves before God; but some troubles especially show that they are sent to bring sin to remembrance. God's judgments often look a great way back, which requires us to do so, when we are under his rebukes. It is not for us to object against the people's smarting for the sin of their king; perhaps they helped him. Nor against this generation suffering for the sin of the last. God often visits the sins of the fathers upon the children, and he gives no account of any matters. Time does not wear out the guilt of sin; nor can we build hopes of escape upon the delay of judgments. If we cannot understand all the reasons of Providence in this matter, still we have no right to demand that God should acquaint us with those reasons. It must be right, because it is the will of God, and in the end it will be proved to be so. Money is no satisfaction for blood. It should seem, Saul's posterity trod in his steps, for it is called a bloody house. It was the spirit of the family, therefore they are justly reckoned with for his sin, as well as for their own. The Gibeonites did not require this out of malice against Saul or his family. It was not to gratify any revenge, but for the public good. They were put to death at the beginning of harvest; they were thus sacrificed to turn away the wrath of Almighty God, who had withheld the harvest-mercies for some years past, and to obtain his favour in the present harvest. In vain do we expect mercy from God, unless we do justice upon our sins. Executions must not be thought cruel, which are for the public welfare.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seven men - Seven was a sacred number not only with the Hebrews but with other Oriental nations <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-1.htm">Numbers 23:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/23-29.htm">Numbers 23:29</a>, and is therefore brought in on this occasion when the judicial death of the sons of Saul was a religious act intended to appease the wrath of God for the violation of an oath <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/25-4.htm">Numbers 25:4</a>.<p>Whom the Lord did choose - Rather, "the Lord's chosen," or elect.

Let seven men of his sons be delivered unto us, and we will hang them up unto the Lord in Gibeah of Saul&#8212;The practice of the Hebrews, as of most Oriental nations, was to slay first, and afterwards to suspend on a gibbet, the body not being left hanging after sunset. The king could not refuse this demand of the Gibeonites, who, in making it, were only exercising their right as blood-avengers; and, although through fear and a sense of weakness they had not hitherto claimed satisfaction, yet now that David had been apprised by the oracle of the cause of the long-prevailing calamity, he felt it his duty to give the Gibeonites full satisfaction&#8212;hence their specifying the number seven, which was reckoned full and complete. And if it should seem unjust to make the descendants suffer for a crime which, in all probability, originated with Saul himself, yet his sons and grandsons might be the instruments of his cruelty, the willing and zealous executors of this bloody raid.<p>the king said, I will give them&#8212;David cannot be charged with doing this as an indirect way or ridding himself of rival competitors for the throne, for those delivered up were only collateral branches of Saul's family, and never set up any claim to the sovereignty.

They settled upon this number, either because they were seven, and no more of the Gibeonites, whom Saul slew, as the Jew say (i); two hewers of wood, two drawers of water, a keeper (of a synagogue), a scribe, and a servant; but perhaps the true reason was, they knew there were no more besides Mephibosheth, for whom David had a great respect, and therefore required no more: <p>and we will hang them up unto the Lord; not to gratify a revengeful spirit of theirs, but in honour to the justice of God, and to appease his wrath: <p>in Gibeah of Saul, whom the Lord did choose; which was Saul's native place, and where he always lived; so that to hang them there was to the greater disgrace of him and his family; and he being chosen of the Lord to be a king of Israel, was an aggravation of his crime in violating the oath made to the Gibeonites <p>and the king said, I will give them; for though he had sworn to Saul that he would not cut off his seed, yet as he had a divine direction in this case, as appears by the Lord's being pleased with it, and was entreated for the land by it, this oath of his was dispensed with; nor did he cut them off himself but delivered them to others, according to the will of God. <p>(i) T.

But the Gibeonites were probably very barbarous, and, when David had delivered the seven lads into their hands, would perhaps wreak upon them a cruel vengeance. <span class="accented">Seven</span> were chosen, because it is the perfect number, with many religious associations; and <span class="cmt_word">unto the Lord</span> means "publicly."

The author evidently found the two lists in his sources, and included them both in his work, for the simple reason that they belonged to different periods, as the difference in the names of some of the officers clearly shows, and that they supplemented on another. The list before us belongs to a later period of David's reign than the one in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16-18</a>. In addition to the office-bearers mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8.htm">2 Samuel 8</a>, we find here Adoram over the tribute, and Ira the Kairite a confidential counsellor (cohen: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>), in the place of the sons of David noticed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>. The others are the same in both lists. The Chethib &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; is to be read &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-4.htm">2 Kings 11:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-19.htm">2 Kings 11:19</a>), from &#1499;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, perfodit, and is synonymous with &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497; (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-18.htm">2 Samuel 8:18</a>). Adoram is the same person as Adoniram, who is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-6.htm">1 Kings 4:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-14.htm">1 Kings 5:14</a> as overseer over the tributary service in the time of Solomon; as we may see from the fact, that the latter is also called Adoram in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-18.htm">1 Kings 12:18</a>, and Hadoram in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/10-18.htm">2 Chronicles 10:18</a>. Hadoram is apparently only a contracted form of the name, and not merely a copyist's mistake for Adoniram. But when we find that, according to the passage cited, the same man filled this office under three kings, we must bear in mind that he did not enter upon it till the close of David's reign, as he is not mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-16.htm">2 Samuel 8:16</a>., and that his name only occurs in connection with Rehoboam's ascent of the throne; so that there is no ground for assuming that he filled the office for any length of time under that monarch. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1505; does not mean vectigal, i.e., tribute or tributary service, but tributary labourers. The derivation of the word is uncertain, and has been disputed. The appointment of a special prefect over the tributary labourers can hardly have taken place before the closing years of David's reign, when the king organized the internal administration of the kingdom more firmly than before. On the tributary labourers, see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>. Ira the Jairite is never mentioned again. There is no ground for altering Jairi (the Jairite) into Jithri (the Jithrite), as Thenius proposes, since the rendering given in the Syriac ("from Jathir") is merely an inference from <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>; and the assumption upon which this conclusion is founded, viz., that Ira, the hero mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-38.htm">2 Samuel 23:38</a>, is the same person as Ira the royal cohen, is altogether unfounded. </body></html>
