David fainted, but he did not flee, and God sent help in the time of need. In spiritual conflicts, even strong saints sometimes wax faint; then Satan attacks them furiously; but those who stand their ground and resist him, shall be relieved and made more than conquerors. Death is a Christian's last enemy, and a son of Anak; but through Him that triumphed for us, believers shall be more than conquerors at last, even over that enemy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/2_samuel/21.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Four - Not necessarily meaning that they were brothers, but that they were all of the race of the Giant, all Rephaim.

Moreover the Philistines had yet war again with Israel&#8212;Although the Philistines had completely succumbed to the army of David, yet the appearance of any gigantic champions among them revived their courage and stirred them up to renewed inroads on the Hebrew territory. Four successive contests they provoked during the latter period of David's reign, in the first of which the king ran so imminent a risk of his life that he was no longer allowed to encounter the perils of the battlefield.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/2_samuel/21.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Fell by the hand of David; </span> either because they were slain by his conduct, and counsel, or concurrence; for he contributed by his hand to the death of one of them, whilst maintaining a fight with him, he gave Abishai the easier opportunity of killing him, <span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-16.htm" title="And Ishbibenob, which was of the sons of the giant, the weight of whose spear weighed three hundred shekels of brass in weight, he being girded with a new sword, thought to have slain David.">2 Samuel 21:16</a>,17</span>; or because what is done by the inferior commanders is commonly ascribed to the general, both in sacred and profane writers. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/2_samuel/21.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>These four were born to the giant in Gath,....

This may be gathered from the books of the Chronicles, where three of the heroic feats mentioned here are attached to the general survey of David's wars (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/20-4.htm">1 Chronicles 20:4</a>). David was exhausted in this fight, and a Philistian giant thought to slay him; but Abishai came to his help and slew the giant. He was called Yishbo benob (Keri, Yishbi), i.e., not Yishbo at Nob, but Yishbobenob, a proper name, the meaning of which is probably "his dwelling is on the height," and which may have been given to him because of his inaccessible castle. He was one of the descendants of Raphah, i.e., one of the gigantic race of Rephaim. Raphah was the tribe-father of the Rephaim, an ancient tribe of gigantic stature, of whom only a few families were left even in Moses' time (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-11.htm">Deuteronomy 2:11</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-13.htm">Deuteronomy 3:13</a>, and the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>). The weight of his lance, i.e., of the metal point to his lance, was three hundred shekels, or eight pounds, of brass, half as much as the spear of Goliath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/17-7.htm">1 Samuel 17:7</a>); "and he was girded with new armour." Bttcher has no doubt given the correct explanation of the word &#1495;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;; he supposes the feminine to be used in a collective sense, so that the noun ("armour," &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493;) could be dispensed with. (For parallels both to the words and facts, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-11.htm">Judges 18:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-41.htm">Deuteronomy 1:41</a>.) &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, he said (sc., to himself), i.e., he thought.</body></html>
