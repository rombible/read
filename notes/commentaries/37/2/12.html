On the other hand (<a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-13.htm" title="Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.">Haggai 2:13</a>), he who was defiled by such a pollution as contact with a dead body, <span class= "ital">conveyed defilement</span> even to the tabernacle. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm" title="Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.">Numbers 19:13</a> : “Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the Lord.”) Even so, according to Haggai, the guilt of impiety incurred by the Jews in neglecting the Temple had tainted the labour of their hands, and caused famine. And what merit they might claim for restoring the altar-worship and keeping the prescribed feasts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezra/3-2.htm" title="Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his brothers, and built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.">Ezra 3:2-6</a>) was not conveyed further. It was cancelled by their neglect of an equally important duty. This latter point, however, is not brought out, but is left to be supplied by the prophet’s hearers.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-19 Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ask now the priests concerning the law - The priests answer rightly, that, by the law, insulated unholiness spread further than insulated holiness. The flesh of the sacrifice hallowed whatever it should touch,  but not further; but the human being, who was defiled by touching a dead body, defiled all he might touch <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>. Haggai does not apply the first part; namely, that the worship on the altar which they reared, while they neglected the building of the temple, did not hallow. The possession of a truly tiring does not counterbalance disobedience. Contrariwise, one defilement defiled the whole man and all which he touched, according to that <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, "whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."<p>In the application, the two melt into one, for the holy thing, namely, the altar which they raised out of fear on their return, so far from hallowing the land or people by the sacrifices offered thereon, was itself defiled. "This people" and "this nation" (not "My people") since they in act disowned Him. "Whatever they offer there," i. e., on that altar, instead of the temple which God commanded, is unclean, offending Him who gave all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. "Holy flesh" (that is, the flesh of a sacrifice, Jer 11:15), indeed, makes holy the "skirt" in which it is carried; but that "skirt" cannot impart its sanctity to any thing beyond, as "bread," &c. (Le 6:27). This is cited to illustrate the principle, that a sacrifice, holy, as enveloping divine things (just as the "skirt" is "holy" which envelops "holy" flesh), cannot by its inherent or opus operatum efficacy make holy a person whose disobedience, as that of the Jew while neglecting God's house, made him unholy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If one, </span> any one, bear, carry away from the altar, or the priest’s hands, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">holy flesh, </span> part of the sacrifice, legally and ceremonially sanctified, or made holy by the altar on which the whole was sanctified, of which a part is supposed to be carried away <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the skirt of his garment, </span> in the lap of his garment, or in any other cloth or napkin, and this cloth touch any common thing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as bread, </span>& c., shall that common thing by such contact become legally or ceremonially holy? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The priests answered:</span> who these priests were is not mentioned, but it is likely that there were some among the people who did by the prophet’s persuasion go and propose the case, and they received the answer as here in the negative, for neither mediate nor yet immediate touch of holy things could make common things or unholy persons holy. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">If one, </span> any one, bear, carry away from the altar, or the priest’s hands, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">holy flesh, </span> part of the sacrifice, legally and ceremonially sanctified, or made holy by the altar on which the whole was sanctified, of which a part is supposed to be carried away <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">in the skirt of his garment, </span> in the lap of his garment, or in any other cloth or napkin, and this cloth touch any common thing, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">as bread, </span>& c., shall that common thing by such contact become legally or ceremonially holy? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The priests answered:</span> who these priests were is not mentioned, but it is likely that there were some among the people who did by the prophet’s persuasion go and propose the case, and they received the answer as here in the negative, for neither mediate nor yet immediate touch of holy things could make common things or unholy persons holy. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/haggai/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment,....

Gilla&#770;h, to uncover. Shu&#772;l&#305;&#772;m, fimbriae, the skirts, borders, or lower end of the long sweeping dress (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-33.htm">Exodus 28:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>). &#1506;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498;, over thy countenance, so that the train when lifted up is drawn over the face. &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;, a contraction of &#1502;&#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, from &#1506;&#1512;&#1492;, signifies in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-36.htm">1 Kings 7:36</a> an empty space, here nakedness or shame equivalent to &#1506;&#1512;&#1493;&#1492;.

Shiqquts&#305;&#772;m, objects of abhorrence, is used most frequently of idols; but here it is used in a more general sense for unclean or repulsive things, dirt and filth. Throwing dirt upon any one is a figurative expression for the most ignominious treatment or greatest contempt. Nibbe&#772;l, to treat contemptuously, not with words, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/micah/7-6.htm">Micah 7:6</a>, but with deeds, equivalent to insult or abuse (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-21.htm">Jeremiah 14:21</a>).

This is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>, where &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498; contains a play upon &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;.

The last two clauses express the thought that no one will take pity upon the devastated city, because its fate is so well deserved; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-19.htm">Isaiah 51:19</a>, where the same words are used of Jerusalem. Nineveh will not be able to protect herself from destruction even by her great power. The prophet wrests this vain hope away from her by pointing in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-8.htm">Isaiah 51:8</a>. to the fall of the mighty Thebes in Egypt. </body></html>
