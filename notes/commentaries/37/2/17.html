The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I smote you with blasting and mildew, - two diseases of grain, which Moses had foretold <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-27.htm">Deuteronomy 28:27</a>. as chastisements on disobedience and God's infliction, of which Amos had spoken in these self-same words. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>.

"Thou also wilt be drunken, shalt be hidden; thou also wilt seek for a refuge from the enemy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-12.htm">Nahum 3:12</a>. All thy citadels are fig-trees with early figs; if they are shaken, they fall into the mouth of the eater. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>. Behold thy people, women in the midst of thee; the gates of thy land are thrown quite open to thine enemies; fire consumes thy bolts." &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468; corresponds to &#1490;&#1468;&#1501;&#1470;&#1492;&#1497;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-10.htm">Nahum 3:10</a> : as she, so also thou. "The fate of No-amon is a prophecy of thine own" (Hitzig). &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, thou wilt be drunken, viz., from the goblet of divine wrath, as at <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497; &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1502;&#1492; might mean, "thou wilt be hiding thyself;" but although this might suit what follows, it does not agree with  &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; ,  since an intoxicated person is not in the habit of hiding himself. Moreover, &#1504;&#1506;&#1500;&#1501; always means "hidden," occultus; so that Calvin's interpretation is the correct one: "Thou wilt vanish away as if thou hadst never been; the Hebrews frequently using the expression being hidden for being reduced to nothing." This is favoured by a comparison both with <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/2-12.htm">Nahum 2:12</a>, and also with the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-16.htm">Obadiah 1:16</a>, "They will drink, and be as if they had not been." This is carried out still further in what follows: "Thou wilt seek refuge from the enemy," i.e., in this connection, seek it in vain, or without finding it; not, "Thou wilt surely demand salvation from the enemy by surrender" (Strauss), for &#1502;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489; does not belong to &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, but to &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1494; (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-4.htm">Isaiah 25:4</a>). All the fortifications of Nineveh are like fig-trees with early figs (&#1506;&#1501; in the sense of subordination, as in Sol 4:13), which fall into the mouth of the eater when the trees are shaken. The tertium compar. is the facility with which the castles will be taken and destroyed by the enemy assaulting them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-4.htm">Isaiah 28:4</a>). We must not extend the comparison so far, however, as to take the figs as representing cowardly warriors, as Hitzig does. Even in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-13.htm">Nahum 3:13</a>, where the people are compared to women, the point of comparison is not the cowardliness of the warriors, but the weakness and inability to offer any successful resistance into which the nation of the Assyrians, which was at other times so warlike, would be reduced through the force of the divine judgment inflicted upon Nineveh (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-16.htm">Isaiah 19:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-37.htm">Jeremiah 50:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498; belongs to what follows, and is placed first, and pointed with zakeph-katon for the sake of emphasis. The gates of the land are the approaches to it, the passes leading into it, which were no doubt provided with castles. Tuch (p. 35) refers to the mountains on the north, which Pliny calls impassable. The bolts of these gates are the castles, through which the approaches were closed. Jeremiah transfers to Babel what is here said of Nineveh (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-30.htm">Jeremiah 51:30</a>). </body></html>
