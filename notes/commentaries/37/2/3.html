But they could not build such a temple then, as Solomon built. Though our gracious God is pleased if we do as well as we can in his service, yet our proud hearts will scarcely let us be pleased, unless we do as well as others, whose abilities are far beyond ours. Encouragement is given the Jews to go on in the work notwithstanding. They have God with them, his Spirit and his special presence. Though he chastens their transgressions, his faithfulness does not fail. The Spirit still remained among them. And they shall have the Messiah among them shortly; He that should come. Convulsions and changes would take place in the Jewish church and state, but first should come great revolutions and commotions among the nations. He shall come, as the Desire of all nations; desirable to all nations, for in him shall all the earth be blessed with the best of blessings; long expected and desired by all believers. The house they were building should be filled with glory, very far beyond Solomon's temple. This house shall be filled with glory of another nature. If we have silver and gold, we must serve and honour God with it, for the property is his. If we have not silver and gold, we must honour him with such as we have, and he will accept us. Let them be comforted that the glory of this latter house shall be greater than that of the former, in what would be beyond all the glories of the first house, the presence of the Messiah, the Son of God, the Lord of glory, personally, and in human nature. Nothing but the presence of the Son of God, in human form and nature, could fulfil this. Jesus is the Christ, is He that should come, and we are to look for no other. This prophecy alone is enough to silence the Jews, and condemn their obstinate rejection of Him, concerning whom all their prophets spake. If God be with us, peace is with us. But the Jews under the latter temple had much trouble; but this promise is fulfilled in that spiritual peace which Jesus Christ has by his blood purchased for all believers. All changes shall make way for Christ to be desired and valued by all nations. And the Jews shall have their eyes opened to behold how precious He is, whom they have hitherto rejected.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who is left among you? - The question implies that there were those among them, who had seen the first house in its glory, yet but few.

Who is left &#8230; that saw &#8230; first glory&#8212;Many elders present at the laying of the foundation of the second temple who had seen the first temple (Ezr 3:12, 13) in all its glory, wept at the contrast presented by the rough and unpromising appearance of the former in its beginnings. From the destruction of the first temple to the second year of Darius Hystaspes, the date of Haggai's prophecy, was a space of seventy years (Zec 1:12); and to the first year of Cyrus, or the end of the captivity, fifty-two years; so that the elders might easily remember the first temple. The Jews note five points of inferiority: The absence from the second temple of (1) the sacred fire; (2) the Shekinah; (3) the ark and cherubim; (4) the Urim and Thummim; (5) the spirit of prophecy. The connection of it with Messiah more than counterbalanced all these; for He is the antitype to all the five (Hag 2:9).<p>how do ye see it now?&#8212;God's estimate of things is very different from man's (Zec 8:6; compare 1Sa 16:7). However low their estimate of the present temple ("it") from its outward inferiority, God holds it superior (Zec 4:10; 1Co 1:27, 28).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who is left among you?</span> there are surely some that are of that age as to have seen the temple which our father’s sins, God’s just displeasure, and the Chaldean malice burnt; who are they? and where may they be found?

Not taken away by death, yet alive, and dwelling among them; and who lived before the destruction of the first temple, built by Solomon; and has seen it in all its magnificence; its grand and noble structure; its stately pillars; its carved work, and decorations of gold. This shows that it was not in the times of Darius Nothus, but of Darius Hystaspis, that Haggai prophesied: those who go the former way make these men to have lived near two hundred years at least, which was greatly beyond the common time of man's life in that age; or consider these words as a mere supposition, that, if there were or had been such persons then living, this building, in comparison of the former, must have appeared mean and contemptible unto them: but the words manifestly imply that there were persons among them then living, who had seen Solomon's temple in all its glory; and who are particularly and personally addressed in the following clauses; and of whom there might be several at this time, going the latter way; for the seventy years' captivity are to be reckoned from the fourth year of Jehoiakim, in which the captivity began, and which was the first year of Nebuchadnezzar, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-1.htm">Jeremiah 25:1</a> but it was not until the nineteenth year of his reign that the temple, was burnt by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-12.htm">Jeremiah 52:12</a> and the time of Haggai's prophesying being about seventeen or eighteen years after the proclamation of Cyrus, when the seventy years' captivity ended; this shows that it was scarcely seventy years from the time the temple was destroyed; and therefore it may be reasonably supposed there were several ancient persons living that could remember to have seen it; and it is certain that there were a great number of such living that returned from Babylon, who wept when they saw the foundation of the second temple laid, which was but fifteen years before this, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a> some of whom, in all probability, were now alive, yea, it is certain there were, to whom the following questions were put: <p>and how do ye see it now? is not this that is building very different from that? does it promise anything like it? what ideas have you of it? can you conceive in your minds that it will ever rise up to such grandeur and stateliness as the former? what is your judgment, and what your sentiments concerning it? can you think of it with equal delight and pleasure as of the former? <p>is it not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing? do not you think that it is not to be mentioned, or once named, in comparison of the former temple? or that a man had as good say nothing at all, as to attempt a comparison of them? or that this building and nothing are alike? and that the one is a nonentity, as well as the other, comparatively speaking, when set in competition with the first temple? and are not you of opinion that the people had as good do nothing, and that in effect they are doing nothing, and all their labour lost, who are working in this house? no answer is returned, nor any waited for: but it is as if the Lord had said, I, who am the omniscient God, the discerner of the thoughts of men, know that these are your sentiments, and these the reasonings of your minds; and but now lest discovering these thoughts of theirs, and speaking out their minds freely as they might, which would tend to discourage the governors and the people in carrying on the work they had engaged in; the Lord by the prophet says to them, as follows: <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/haggai/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who <i>is</i> left among you that saw this <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> house in her first glory? and how do ye see it now? <i>is it</i> not in your eyes in comparison of it as nothing?</span><p>(a) For the people according as had been prophesied in Isa 2:2 and Eze 41:1-26, thought this temple should have been more excellent than Solomon's temple, which was destroyed by the Babylonians, but the Prophets meant the spiritual Temple, the Church of Christ.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/haggai/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">Who is left among you?</span> &c.] When the foundations of this Temple were laid in the second year of Cyrus there were many such.

Many have thought that Haggai himself was of the number. It was sixty-eight years ago that the temple was destroyed, and we can well believe that its remarkable features were deeply impressed on the minds of those who as boys or youths had loved and admired it. Ezra tells us (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/3-12.htm">Ezra 3:12</a>) that "many of the priests and Levites" [when the foundation first was laid] and chief of the fathers, who were ancient men, that had seen the first house,...  wept with a loud voice." This house. The prophet identifies the present with Solomon's temple, as being adapted for the same purposes, to fill the same place in the national life, built on the same hallowed spot, and partly with the same materials. In the Jews' eyes there was one only temple, whatever might be the date of its erection or the comparative worth of its decorations and materials. <span class="cmt_word">First</span>; <span class="accented">former</span>, as ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">How do ye see it now?</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-18.htm">Numbers 13:18</a>). In what condition do ye see this house now? <span class="cmt_word">Is it not in your eyes in com<span class="accented">parison</span> of it as nothing?</span> The words, "in comparison of it," ought to be omitted, as not required by the Hebrew idiom. Does it not seem in your eyes as if it had no existence? If the injunction of Cyrus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/1-3.htm">Ezra 1:3</a>, etc.) had been carried out, the dimensions cf. the new temple would have exceeded those of the old; but Zerubbabel seems to have been unable, with the small resources at his disposal, to execute the original design, though even so the proportions were not greatly inferior to those of the earlier temple. But the chief inferiority lay in the absence of the splendour and enrichment with which Solomon adorned his edifice. The gold which he had lavished on the house was no longer available; the precious stones could not be had. Besides. these defects, the Talmudists reckon five things wanting in this second temple, viz. the ark of the covenant, with the cherubim and mercy seat; the holy fire; the Shechinah; the spirit of prophecy; the Urim and Thnmmim. It was, according to Josephus, only half the height of Solomon's-sixty cubits ('Ant.,' 15:11, 1), and it appears to have been in many respects inferior to the first building ('Ant.,' 4:02). Hecabaeus of Abdera gives the dimensions of the courts as five hundred feet in length and a hundred cubits in breadth (double the width of the court of the tabernacle), and the size of the altar as twenty cubits square and ten cubits high (see Josephus, 'Cont. Ap.,' 1:22; Conder, 'Handbook to the Bible,' p. 370). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/nahum/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>At the conquest of Nineveh the numerous inhabitants flee, and the rich city is plundered. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-8.htm">Nahum 2:8</a>.

With &#1493;&#1488;&#1497;&#1503; &#1511;&#1510;&#1492; the prophecy passes into a simple description. There is no end lattekhu&#772;na&#770;h, to the furnishing with treasures.

That there were immense treasures of the precious metals and of costly vessels treasured up in Nineveh, may be inferred with certainty from the accounts of ancient writers, which border on the fabulous.<p>(Note: For proofs, see Layard's Nineveh, ii. 415ff., and Movers, Phnizier (iii. 1, pp. 40, 41). After quoting the statements of Ctesias, the latter observes that "these numbers are indeed fabulous; but they have their historical side, inasmuch as in the time of Ctesias the riches of Nineveh were estimated at an infinitely greater amount than the enormous treasures accumulated in the treasuries of the Persian empire. That the latter is quite in accordance with truth, may be inferred from the fact that the conquerors of Nineveh, the Medes and Chaldaeans, of whose immense booty, in the shape of gold, silver, and other treasures, even the prophet Nahum speaks, furnished Ecbatana and Babylon with gold and silver from the booty of Nineveh to an extent unparalleled in all history.")<p>Of all these treasures nothing was left but desolate emptiness. This is expressed by the combination of three synonymous words. Bu&#772;qa&#770;h and mebhu&#772;qa&#770;h are substantive formations from bu&#772;q  equals  ba&#770;qaq, to empty out, and are combined to strengthen the idea, like similar combinations in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-15.htm">Zephaniah 1:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-29.htm">Ezekiel 33:29</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-2.htm">Isaiah 29:2</a>. Mebhulla&#770;qa&#770;h is a synonymous noun formed from the participle pual, and signifying devastation (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-1.htm">Isaiah 24:1</a>, where even ba&#770;laq is combined with ba&#770;qaq). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-11.htm">Nahum 2:11</a> the horror of the vanquished at the total devastation of Nineveh is described, also in short substantive clauses: "melted heart" (na&#770;me&#772;s is a participle), i.e., perfect despondency (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-7.htm">Isaiah 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>); trembling of the knees, so that from terror men can hardly keep upon their feet (p&#305;&#772;q for pu&#772;q; it only occurs here). Chalcha&#770;la&#770;h formed by reduplication from ch&#305;&#772;l: spasmodic pains in all loins, like the labour pains of women in childbirth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-3.htm">Isaiah 21:3</a>). Lastly, the faces of all turning pale (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>). </body></html>
