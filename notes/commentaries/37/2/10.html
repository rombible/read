The question was put to the priests, whose office it was <span class="ital">to put a difference between holy and unholy, between clean and unclean, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-10.htm" title="And that you may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;">Leviticus 10:10</a> : that is, to be thoroughly acquainted with all the ceremonial laws, and to instruct others concerning them. <span class="ital">If one bear, </span>or carry, <span class="ital">holy flesh — </span>Part of the sacrifice, legally sanctified, or made holy, by the altar on which the whole was sanctified; <span class="ital">in the skirt </span>— In the lap; <span class="ital">of his garment — </span>Or in any other cloth; and if this cloth touch any common thing, as bread, &c., shall that become legally holy? <span class="ital">And the priests said, No — </span>By the answer of the priests in this, compared with the following verse, we find, that legal holiness was not so easily communicated as legal impurity: for the holy flesh did not make any thing that was touched by it holy; but the touch of a person who was unclean rendered holy things unclean. Thus is vice much more easily contracted than virtue! Broad and easy is the way that leadeth to sin. but narrow and difficult is that which leads to holiness! <span class="ital">Then said Haggai — </span>Now a second case is proposed; <span class="ital">If one that is unclean by a dead body touch any of these — </span>Namely, the things mentioned in the former verse, bread, pottage, wine, &c.; <span class="ital">shall it be unclean? — </span>Shall that which the unclean person doth touch become unclean?

The least defect is sufficient to make a thing evil, whereas, to make it good and perfect, a concurrence of all good qualities is requisite. <span class="ital">So is this people before me — </span>In like manner, saith God, your neglect of my temple, and your disregard of my worships have made you unclean, as if you had contracted legal pollution by touching a dead body; and rendered every thing you undertake, even the sacrifices you offer on my altar, unclean and unacceptable.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:10-19 Many spoiled this good work, by going about it with unholy hearts and hands, and were likely to gain no advantage by it. The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former - or, perhaps, more probably, "the later glory of this house shall be greater than the former;" for he had already spoken of the present temple, as identical with that before the captivity . "Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory, anti how do you see it now?" He had spoken of its "first glory." Now he says, in contrast, its later glory should be greater than that of its most glorious times.  In this case the question, whether the temple of tiered was a different material building from that of Zerubbabel, falls away.<p>In either case, the contrast is between two things, either the temple in that its former estate, and this its latter estate after the captivity, or the two temples of Solomon and Zerubbabel. There is no room for a third temple. God holds out no vain hopes. To comfort those distressed by the poverty of the house of God which they were building, God promises a glory to this house greater than before. A temple, erected, after this had lain waste above 1800 years, even if Antichrist were to come now and to erect a temple at Jerusalem, could be no fulfillment of this prophecy.<p>In material magnificence the temple of Solomon, built and adorned with all the treasures accumulated by David and enlarged by Solomon, far surpassed all which Herod, amid his attempts to give a material meaning to the prophecy, could do. His attempt shows how the eyes of the Jews were fixed on this prophecy, then when it was about to be fulfilled. While taking pains, through the gradualness of his rebuilding, to preserve the identity of the fabric, he lavished his wealth, to draw off their thoughts from the king, whom the Jews looked for, to himself. The friendship of the Romans who were lords of all, was to replace the "all nations," of whom Haggai spoke; he pointed also to the length of peace, the possession of wealth, the greatness of revenues, the surpassing expenditure beyond those before.  A small section of Erastians admitted these claims of the murderer of his sons.<p>The Jews generally were not diverted from looking on to Him who should come. Those five things, the absence whereof they felt, were connected with their atoning worhip or God's presence among them;  "the ark with the mercy-seat and the cherubim, the Urim and Tummin, the fire from heaven, the Shechinah, the Holy Spirit." Material magnificence could not replace spiritual glory. The explanations of the great Jewish authorities,  that the second temple was superior to the first in structure (which was untrue) or in duration, were laid aside by Jews who had any other solution wherewith to satisfy themselves. "The Shechinah and the five precious things," says one,  "which, according to our wise of blessed memory, were in it, and not in the second house, raised and exalted it beyond compare." Another  says, "When Haggai saith, 'greater shall be the glory of this later house than the first,' how is it; that the house which Zerubbabel built through the income which the king of Persia gave them was more glorious than the house which Solomon built? And though it is said that the building which Herod made, was exceeding beautiful and rich, we should not think that it was in its beauty like to the house which Solomon built. For what the wise of blessed memory have said of the beauty of the house of Herod is in relation to the house which Zerubbabel built. How much more, since Scripture saith not, 'Great shall be the beauty or the wealth of this latter house above the first,' but the glory: and the glory is not the wealth or the beauty, or the largeness of the dimensions of the building, as they said in their interpretations, for the 'glory' is in truth spoken of the glory of God, which filled the tabernacle, after it was set up, and of the glory of God which filled the house of God, which Solomon built, when he brought the ark into the holy of holies, which is the Divine cloud and the Light supreme, which came down thither in the eyes of all the people, and it is said, 'And it was when the priests came out of the Italy place, the cloud filled the house of God, and the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of God filled the house of God.' And this glory was not in the second house.<p>And how shall it be said, if so, 'great shall be the glory of this later house above the first?'" The poor unconverted Jew did not know the answer to his question: "Through the presence of God, in the substance of our flesh; through the son given to us, Whose name should be Mighty God." The glory of this temple was in Him Who <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. was made Flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth."  "There Christ, the Son of God, was, as a Child, offered to God: there He sat in the midst of the Doctors; there He taught and revealed things, hidden from the foundation of the world. The glory of the temple of Solomon was, that in it the majesty of God appeared, veiling itself in a cloud: in this, that same Majesty showed itself, in very deed united with the Flesh, visible to sight: so that Jesus Himself said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-9.htm">John 14:9</a>. "He that hath seen Me hath seen the Father." This it was which Malachi sang with joy <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a>, "The Lord whom ye seek shall suddenly come to His temple, even the Messenger of the covenant, whom ye delight in."<p>And in this place I will give peace - Temporal peace they had now, nor was there any prospect of its being disturbed. They were quiet subjects of the Persiam empire, which included also all their former enemies, greater or less. Alexander subdued all the bordering countries which did not yield, but spared themselves. Temporal peace then was nothing, to be then given them, for they had it. In later times they had it not. The temple itself was profaned by Antiochus Epiphanes (1 Macc. 1:39, 40). "Her sanctuary was laid waste like a wilderness. As had been her glory, so was her dishonor increased." Again by Pompey (Josephus, Ant. xiv. 4. 4. B. J. i. 7.) by Crassus (Josephus, Ant. xiv. 7. 1. B. J. i. 9. 8), the Parthians (Josephus, Ant. xiv. 13. 3. 4.) before it was destroyed by Titus and the Romans. Jews saw this and, knowing nothing of the peace in Jesus, argued from the absence of outward peace, that the prophecy was not fulfilled under the second temple.  "What Scripture says, 'and in this place I will give peace,' is opposed to their interpretation. For all the days of the duration of the second house were "in strait of times and not in peace," as was written in Daniel, "and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again and the fosse, and in strait of time," and, as I said, in the time of Herod there was no peace whatever, for the sword did not depart from his house to the day of his death; and after his death the hatred among the Jews increased, and the Gentiles straitened them, until they were destroyed from the face of the earth."<p>But spiritual peace is, throughout prophecy, part of the promise of the Gospel. Christ Himself was to be <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-6.htm">Isaiah 9:6-7</a> "the Prince of peace: of the increase of His government and of His peace there was to be no end;" in His days <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/72-3.htm">Psalm 72:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/72-7.htm">Psalm 72:7</a> "the mountains were to bring peace to the people; there should be abundance of peace, so long as the moon endureth; the work of righteousness was to be peace <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-17.htm">Isaiah 32:17</a>, the chastisement of our peace (that which obtained it) was upon Him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-5.htm">Isaiah 53:5</a>, "great should be the peace of her children" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>, in the Gospel God would give peace, true peace, to the "far off and the near" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-19.htm">Isaiah 57:19</a>.

Spiritual peace being thus prominent in the Gospel and in prophecy, as the gift of God, it were unnatural to explain the peace which God promised here to give, as other than He promised elsewhere; peace in Him who is "our peace, Jesus Christ."<p> "Peace and tranquility of mind is above all glory of the house; because peace passeth all understanding.

The Third Prophecy<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By a reference to the ceremonial law, as officially interpreted by the priests in answer to questions addressed to them, Haggai again impresses upon the people the truth, that the dearth and distress from which they had hitherto suffered was the consequence of their national sin in neglecting to rebuild the temple, and again promises that now that they had put away that sin, and were honestly giving themselves to the work of restoration, the blessing of God should rest upon them. The sanctifying influence of flesh, which by being offered to God in sacrifice had become holy, could only extend, so the priests on the authority of the law declared, to that with which it came into first and immediate contact. Beyond that limit its efficacy did not reach. The thing touched by it was itself made holy, but did not become in its turn a vehicle of holiness to anything beyond. Not so, however, was it with that which by contact with ceremonial uncleanness had become polluted. That which by touching a corpse had contracted defilement was not only unclean itself, but propagated uncleanness, and conveyed it to everything with which it came in contact. So was it with the Jewish nation in the sight of God, as represented by the returned captives. They might argue indeed that they had rebuilt the altar of Jehovah on their first return. But that good act, if it stood alone, even had there been no subsequent disobedience to vitiate it, would only, like the holy flesh making holy the garment in which it was wrapped, have extended its influence a little way. The altar would have sanctified the gift which was offered upon it. On the other hand the sin of the people in neglecting to rebuild the temple, like the touch of the corpse, not only contaminated themselves, but brought moral pollution and consequent blight and disaster upon all the works of their hands.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/haggai/2.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 10-19.</span> - Part III.

"The cracking of whips, and noise of the rattling of wheels, and the horse in galloping, and chariots flying high. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-3.htm">Nahum 3:3</a>. Riders dashing along, and flame of the sword, and flashing of the lance, and multitude of slain men and mass of dead men, and no end of corpses; they stumble over their corpses. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-4.htm">Nahum 3:4</a>. For the multitude of the whoredoms of the harlot, the graceful one, the mistress of witchcrafts, who sells nations with her whoredoms, and families with her witchcrafts." Nahum sees in spirit the hostile army bursting upon Nineveh. He hears the noise, i.e., the cracking of the whips of the charioteers, and the rattling (ra&#8219;ash) of the chariot-wheels, sees horses and chariots driving along (da&#770;har, to hunt, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-22.htm">Judges 5:22</a>; riqqe&#772;d, to jump, applied to the springing up of the chariots as they drive quickly along over a rugged road), dashing riders (ma&#8219;a&#774;leh, lit., to cause to ascend, sc. the horse, i.e., to make it prance, by driving the spur into its side to accelerate its speed), flaming swords, and flashing lances. As these words are well adapted to depict the attack, so are those which follow to describe the consequence or effect of the attack. Slain men, fallen men in abundance, and so many corpses, that one cannot help stumbling or falling over them. &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1491;, the heavy multitude. The chethib &#1497;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493; is to be read &#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; (niphal), in the sense of stumbling, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>. The keri &#1493;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is unsuitable, as the sentence does not express any progress, but simply exhibits the infinite number of the corpses (Hitzig). &#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, their (the slain men's) corpses. This happens to the city of sins because of the multitude of its whoredoms. Nineveh is called Zo&#772;na&#770;h, and its conduct zenu&#772;n&#305;&#772;m, not because it had fallen away from the living God and pursued idolatry, for there is nothing about idolatry either here or in what follows; nor because of its commercial intercourse, in which case the commerce of Nineveh would appear here under the perfectly new figure of love-making with other nations (Ewald), for commercial intercourse as such is not love-making; but the love-making, with its parallel "witchcrafts" (kesha&#770;ph&#305;&#772;m), denotes "the treacherous friendship and crafty politics with which the coquette in her search for conquests ensnared the smaller states" (Hitzig, after Abarbanel, Calvin, J. H. Michaelis, and others). This policy is called whoring or love-making, "inasmuch as it was that selfishness which wraps itself up in the dress of love, and under the appearance of love seeks simply the gratification of its own lust" (Hengstenberg on the Rev.). The zo&#772;na&#770;h is described still more minutely as &#1496;&#1493;&#1489;&#1514; &#1495;&#1503;, beautiful with grace. This refers to the splendour and brilliancy of Nineveh, by which this city dazzled and ensnared the nations, like a graceful coquette.
