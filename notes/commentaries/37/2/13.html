The sum of these two rules of the law is, that sin is more easily learned from others than holiness. The impurity of their hearts and lives shall make the work of their hands, and all their offerings, unclean before God. The case is the same with us. When employed in any good work, we should watch over ourselves, lest we render it unclean by our corruptions. When we begin to make conscience of duty to God, we may expect his blessing; and whoso is wise will understand the loving-kindness of the Lord. God will curse the blessings of the wicked, and make bitter the prosperity of the careless; but he will sweeten the cup of affliction to those who diligently serve him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ask now the priests concerning the law - The priests answer rightly, that, by the law, insulated unholiness spread further than insulated holiness. The flesh of the sacrifice hallowed whatever it should touch,  but not further; but the human being, who was defiled by touching a dead body, defiled all he might touch <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a>. Haggai does not apply the first part; namely, that the worship on the altar which they reared, while they neglected the building of the temple, did not hallow. The possession of a truly tiring does not counterbalance disobedience. Contrariwise, one defilement defiled the whole man and all which he touched, according to that <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm">James 2:10</a>, "whosoever shall keep the whole law and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all."<p>In the application, the two melt into one, for the holy thing, namely, the altar which they raised out of fear on their return, so far from hallowing the land or people by the sacrifices offered thereon, was itself defiled. "This people" and "this nation" (not "My people") since they in act disowned Him. "Whatever they offer there," i. e., on that altar, instead of the temple which God commanded, is unclean, offending Him who gave all. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/haggai/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. On the other hand, a legally "unclean" person imparts his uncleanness to any thing, whereas a legally holy thing cannot confer its sanctity on an "unclean" person (Nu 19:11, 13, 22). Legal sanctity is not so readily communicated as legal impurity. So the paths to sin are manifold: the paths to holiness one, and that one of difficult access [Grotius]. One drop of filth will defile a vase of water: many drops of water will not purity a vase of filth [Moore].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/haggai/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Now the second case is proposed for resolution, &c. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If one that is unclean; </span> ceremonially or legally polluted, and unclean. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By a dead body; </span> for such touch, though at unawares, did pollute, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm" title="Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.">Numbers 19:13</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Touch any of these; </span> bread or pottage, wine, or oil, or meat. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall it be unclean?</span> shall that which the unclean (by touch of the dead) doth touch become unclean, or no?

To the priests; having nothing to object to their answer; but being satisfied with it, he puts another question: <p>if one that is unclean by a dead body; by the touch of it, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>, <p>touch any of these, shall it be unclean? that is, if such an impure person, who was so in a ceremonial sense, should touch any of the above things, bread, pottage, wine, or oil, or any meat, would not they become unclean thereby, and so not fit for use? <p>and the priests answered and said, it shall be unclean; which was rightly answered; for whatsoever such an unclean person touched was unclean, according to the law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-22.htm">Leviticus 19:22</a>.

The full phrase is found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-6.htm">Numbers 6:6, 11</a>. Contact with a dead body produced the gravest ceremonial uncleanness, which lasted seven days, and could be purged only by a double lustration and other rites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-11.htm">Numbers 19:11</a>, etc.). This uncleanness was doubtless connected with the idea that death was the result of sin. Any of these. The things mentioned in the preceding verse. It shall be unclean. In accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-22.htm">Numbers 19:22</a> A polluted human being communicated his pollution to all that he touched. It was owing to the defilement that accompanied contact with the dead that the later Jews used to whiten the sepulchres every year, that they might be seen and avoided (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-27.htm">Matthew 23:27</a>, and Lightfoot, 'Her.

Shiqquts&#305;&#772;m, objects of abhorrence, is used most frequently of idols; but here it is used in a more general sense for unclean or repulsive things, dirt and filth.

This is evident from <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-7.htm">Nahum 3:7</a>, where &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1498; contains a play upon &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;.
