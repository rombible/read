In attending to God's ministers, we must have respect to him that sent them. The word of the Lord has success, when by his grace he stirs up our spirits to comply with it. It is in the day of Divine power we are made willing. When God has work to be done, he will either find or make men fit to do it. Every one helped, as his ability was; and this they did with a regard to the Lord as their God. Those who have lost time, need to redeem time; and the longer we have loitered in folly, the more haste we should make. God met them in a way of mercy.

This was the beginning of a conversion. In this one thing they began to do, what, all along, in their history, and most in their decay before the captivity they refused to do - obey God's word. So God sums up their history, by Jeremiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-21.htm">Jeremiah 22:21</a>. "I spake unto thee in thy prosperity, thou saidst, I will not hear. This is thy way from thy youth, that thou hearkenedst not unto My voice." <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/3-2.htm">Zephaniah 3:2</a> still more briefly , "she hearkened not unto (any) voice." Now in reference, it seems, to that account of their disobedience, Haggai says, using the self-same formula , "they hearkened unto the voice of the Lord,  "according to the words of Haggai." They obeyed, not vaguely, or partly, but exactly, "according to the words" which the messenger of God spake.<p>And they feared the Lord - o "Certainly the presence of the Divine Majesty is to be teared with great reverence."  "The fear of punishment at times transports the mind to what is better, and the infliction of sorrows harmonizes the mind to the fear of God; and that of the Proverbs comes true, <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/13-13.htm">Proverbs 13:13</a>. "He that feareth the Lord shall be recompensed," and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-23.htm">Proverbs 19:23</a> "the fear of the Lord tendeth to life;" and Wisdom (Ecclesiasticus 1:11). "The fear of the Lord is honor and glory, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/19-12.htm">Proverbs 19:12</a> the fear of the Lord shall rejoice the heart, and giveth joy and gladness and a long life." See how gently and beseemingly God smites us."<p> "See how the lovingkindness of God immediately goes along with all changes for the better. For Almighty God changes along with those who will to repent, and promises that He will be with them; which what can equal? For when God is with us, all harm will depart from us, all good come in to us." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/haggai/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. remnant of the people&#8212;all those who have returned from the exile (Zec 8:6).<p>as &#8230; God sent him&#8212;according to all that Jehovah had enjoined him to speak. But as it is not till Hag 1:14 after Haggai's second message (Hag 1:13) that the people actually obeyed, Maurer translates here, "hearkened to the voice of the Lord," and instead of "as," "because the Lord had sent him." However, English Version rightly represents their purpose of obedience as obedience in God's eyes already, though not carried into effect till Hag 1:14.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/haggai/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> so soon as they heard this convincing and awakening sermon. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shealtiel; </span> who is called <span class="ital">Salathiel</span>, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/3-17.htm" title="And the sons of Jeconiah; Assir, Salathiel his son,">1 Chronicles 3:17</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-12.htm" title="And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;">Matthew 1:12</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Joshua the son of Josedech:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/1-1.htm" title="In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, saying,">Haggai 1:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The high priest; </span> the twenty-fourth from Aaron, as some reckon, (Alsted.

Here follows an account of the success of Haggai's prophecy; with what power and efficacy the word of the Lord by him was attended; how it at once reached and affected the hearts of princes and people, and brought them to obedience to the will of God. The governor and high priest are mentioned first, as being the principal persons, and who very probably first declared their sense of their former neglect, and their readiness to do as they were directed; which was setting a good example to the people, and doubtless had some influence upon them: <p>with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the Lord their God; not the two leading men in church and state only; but all the people that came out of the Babylonish captivity, who were but a remnant; a few that were left through various calamities they had been exposed unto; these, one and all, signified how willing and ready they were to do the work of the Lord enjoined them: or, "they heard the voice of the Lord" (c); by the prophet, very attentively and seriously; and received and regarded it, not as the word of men, but as the word of God; and determined to act according to it: <p>and the words of Haggai the prophet; or, "and for the words of Haggai the prophet" (d); because of them, considering them as coming from the Lord himself: <p>as the Lord their God had sent him; regarding him as having a mission and commission from the Lord to deliver them to them: <p>and the people did fear before the Lord; perceiving that he was displeased with them for the neglect of his house; and that this drought upon them was a chastisement and correction for this sin; and fearing lest his wrath should continue, and they should be more severely dealt with, on account of their transgressions. <p>(c) "et audivit", V.

The chariots rave in the streets, they run over one another on the roads; their appearance is like the torches, they run about like lightning." The suffix attached to gibbo&#772;re&#772;hu&#772; (His heroes) might be taken as referring to me&#772;ph&#305;&#772;ts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a> (2); but it is more natural to refer it to Jehovah in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-2.htm">Nahum 2:2</a> (3), as having summoned the army against Nineveh (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-3.htm">Isaiah 13:3</a>). The shields are reddened, i.e., not radiant (Ewald), but coloured with red, and that not with the blood of enemies who have been slain (Abarbanel and Grotius), but either with red colour with which they are painted, or what is still more probable, with the copper with which they are overlaid: see Josephus, Ant. xiii. 12, 5 (Hitzig). &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1470;&#1495;&#1497;&#1500; are not fighting men generally, i.e., soldiers, but brave men, heroes (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/3-29.htm">Judges 3:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm">1 Samuel 31:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/11-16.htm">2 Samuel 11:16</a>, equivalent to bene&#772; chayil in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-17.htm">1 Samuel 18:17</a>, etc.). &#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., a denom. of &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;&#1506;, coccus: clothed in coccus or crimson. The fighting dress of the nations of antiquity was frequently blood-red (see Aeliani, Var. hist. vi. 6).<p>(Note: Valerius observes on this: "They used Poenic tunics in battle, to disguise and hide the blood of their wounds, not lest the sight of it should fill them with alarm, but lest it should inspire the enemy with confidence.")<p>The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. pela&#770;do&#772;th is certainly not used for lapp&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m, torches; but in both Arabic and Syriac palda&#770;h signifies steel (see Ges. Lex.). But pela&#770;do&#772;th are not scythes, which would suggest the idea of scythe-chariots (Michaelis, Ewald, and others); for scythe-chariots were first introduced by Cyrus, and were unknown before his time to the Medes, the Syrians, the Arabians, and also to the ancient Egyptians (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/17-16.htm">Joshua 17:16</a>). Pela&#770;do&#772;th probably denotes the steel covering of the chariots, as the Assyrian war-chariots were adorned according to the monuments with ornaments of metal.<p>(Note: "The chariots of the Assyrians," says Strauss, "as we see them on the monuments, glare with shining things, made either of iron or steel, battle-axes, bows, arrows, and shields, and all kinds of weapons; the horses are also ornamented with crowns and red fringes, and even the poles of the carriages are made resplendent with shining suns and moons: add to these the soldiers in armour riding in the chariots; and it could not but be the case, that when illumined by the rays of the sun above them, they would have all the appearance of flames as they flew hither and thither with great celerity." Compare also the description of the Assyrian war-chariots given by Layard in his Nineveh and its Remains, vol. ii. p. 348.)<p>The army of the enemy presents the appearance described &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;, in the day of his equipment. &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, to prepare, used of the equipping of an army for an attack or for battle, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-14.htm">Jeremiah 46:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-7.htm">Ezekiel 38:7</a>. The suffix refers to Jehovah, like that in &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-4.htm">Isaiah 13:4</a>, where Jehovah raises an army for war with Babylon. Habbero&#772;sh&#305;&#772;m, the cypresses, are no doubt lances or javelins made of cypress-wood (Grotius and others), not magnates (Chald., Kimchi, and others), or viri hastati. &#1492;&#1512;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, to be swung, or brandished, in the hands of the warriors equipped for battle. The army advances to the assault (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>), and presses into the suburbs. The chariots rave (go mad) in the streets. &#1492;&#1514;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1500;, to behave one's self foolishly, to rave, used here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-9.htm">Jeremiah 46:9</a> for mad driving, or driving with insane rapidity (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>). &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;, hithpalel of &#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1511;, to run (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-9.htm">Joel 2:9</a>); in the intensive form, to run over one another, i.e., to run in such a way that they appear as though they would run over one another. &#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; are roads and open spaces, not outside the city, but inside (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-16.htm">Amos 5:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/144-13.htm">Psalm 144:13-14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-20.htm">Proverbs 1:20</a>), and, indeed, as we may see from what follows, in the suburbs surrounding the inner city of citadel. Their appearance (viz., that of the chariots as they drive raving about) is like torches. The feminine suffix to &#1502;&#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503; can only refer to &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489;, notwithstanding the fact that elsewhere &#1512;&#1499;&#1489; is always construed as a masculine, and that it is so here in the first clauses. For the suffix cannot refer to &#1512;&#1495;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; (Hoelem. and Strauss), because &#1492;&#1512;&#1499;&#1489; is the subject in the following clause as well as in the two previous ones. The best way probably is to take it as a neuter, so that it might refer not to the chariots only, but to everything in and upon the chariots. The appearance of the chariots, as they drove about with the speed of lightning, richly ornamented with bright metal (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a>), and occupied by warriors in splendid clothes and dazzling armour, might very well be compared to torches and flashing lightning. &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, pilel of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1509; (not poel of &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-8.htm">Judges 10:8</a>), cursitare, used of their driving with lightning-speed. </body></html>
