Those employed for God may be driven from their work by a storm, yet they must go back to it. They did not say that they would not build a temple, but, Not yet. Thus men do not say they will never repent and reform, and be religious, but, Not yet. And so the great business we were sent into the world to do, is not done. There is a proneness in us to think wrongly of discouragements in our duty, as if they were a discharge from our duty, when they are only for the trial of our courage and faith. They neglected the building of God's house, that they might have more time and money for worldly affairs. That the punishment might answer to the sin, the poverty they thought to prevent by not building the temple, God brought upon them for not building it. Many good works have been intended, but not done, because men supposed the proper time was not come. Thus believers let slip opportunities of usefulness, and sinners delay the concerns of their souls, till too late. If we labour only for the meat that perishes, as the Jews here, we are in danger of losing our labour; but we are sure it shall not be in vain in the Lord, if we labour for the meat which lasts to eternal life. If we would have the comfort and continuance of temporal enjoyments, we must have God as our Friend. See also Lu 12:33. When God crosses our temporal affairs, and we meet with trouble and disappointment, we shall find the cause is, that the work we have to do for God and our own souls is left undone, and we seek our own things more than the things of Christ. How many, who plead that they cannot afford to give to pious or charitable designs, often lavish ten times as much in needless expenses on their houses and themselves! But those are strangers to their own interests, who are full of care to adorn and enrich their own houses, while God's temple in their hearts lies waste. It is the great concern of every one, to apply to the necessary duty of self-examination and communion with our own hearts concerning our spiritual state. Sin is what we must answer for; duty is what we must do. But many are quick-sighted to pry into other people's ways, who are careless of their own. If any duty has been neglected, that is no reason why it should still be so. Whatever God will take pleasure in when done, we ought to take pleasure in doing. Let those who have put off their return to God, return with all their heart, while there is time.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is it time for you - You,  being what you are, the creatures of God, "to dwell in your ceiled houses,"  more emphatically, in your houses, and those "ceiled," probably with costly woods, such as cedar .

"What think ye of Jehovah? He makes an end; the affliction will not arise twice. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>. For though they be twisted together like thorns, and as if intoxicated with their wine, they shall be devoured like dry stubble. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a>. From thee has one come out, who meditated evil against Jehovah, who advised worthlessness." The question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-9.htm">Nahum 1:9</a> is not addressed to the enemy, viz., the Assyrians, as very many commentators suppose: "What do ye meditate against Jehovah?" For although cha&#770;shabh 'el is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-15.htm">Hosea 7:15</a> for a hostile device with regard to Jehovah, the supposition that 'el is used here for &#8219;al, according to a later usage of the language, is precluded by the fact that &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; &#1506;&#1500; is actually used in this sense in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a>. Moreover, the last clause does not suit this view of the question. The word, "the affliction will not stand up, or not rise up a second time," cannot refer to the Assyrians, or mean that the infliction of a second judgment upon Nineveh will be unnecessary, because the city will utterly fall to the ground in the first judgment, and completely vanish from the earth (Hitzig). For &#1510;&#1512;&#1492; points back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1510;&#1512;&#1492;, and therefore must be the calamity which has fallen upon Judah, or upon those who trust in the Lord, on the part of Nineveh or Asshur (Marck, Maurer, and Strauss). This is confirmed by <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-11.htm">Nahum 1:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-15.htm">Nahum 1:15</a>, where this thought is definitely expressed. Consequently the question, "What think ye with regard to Jehovah?" can only be addressed to the Judaeans, and must mean, "Do ye think that Jehovah cannot or will not fulfil His threat upon Nineveh?" (Cyr., Marck, Strauss). The prophet addresses these words to the anxious minds, which were afraid of fresh invasions on the part of the Assyrians. To strengthen their confidence, he answers the question proposed, by repeating the thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a>. He (Jehovah) is making an end, sc. of the enemy of His people; and he gives a further reason for this in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>. The participial clauses &#1506;&#1491; &#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; to &#1505;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501; are to be taken conditionally: are (or were) they even twisted like thorns. &#1506;&#1491; &#1505;&#1497;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, to thorns  equals  as thorns (&#1506;&#1491; is given correctly by J. H. Michaelis: eo usque ut spinas perplexitate aequent; compare Ewald, 219). The comparison of the enemy to thorns expresses "firmatum callidumque nocendi studium" (Marck), and has been well explained by Ewald thus: "crisp, crafty, and cunning; so that one would rather not go near them, or have anything to do with them" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/23-6.htm">2 Samuel 23:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-4.htm">Micah 7:4</a>). &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1488;&#1501; &#1505;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, not "wetted like their wet" (Hitzig), nor "as it were drowned in wine, so that fire can do no more harm to them than to anything else that is wet" (Ewald); for &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; neither means to wet nor to drown, but to drink, to carouse; and &#1505;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; means drunken, intoxicated. &#1505;&#1489;&#1488; is strong unmixed wine (see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-22.htm">Isaiah 1:22</a>). "Their wine" is the wine which they are accustomed to drink. The simile expresses the audacity and hardiness with which the Assyrians regarded themselves as invincible, and applies very well to the gluttony and revelry which prevailed at the Assyrian court; even if the account given by Diod. Sic. (ii. 26), that when Sardanapalus had three times defeated the enemy besieging Nineveh, in his great confidence in his own good fortune, he ordered a drinking carousal, in the midst of which the enemy, who had been made acquainted with the fact, made a fresh attack, and conquered Nineveh, rests upon a legendary dressing up of the facts. &#1488;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, devoured by fire, is a figure signifying utter destruction; and the perfect is prophetic, denoting what will certainly take place. Like dry stubble: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-24.htm">Isaiah 5:24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-14.htm">Isaiah 47:14</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; is not to be taken, as Ewald supposes (279, a), as strengthening &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, "fully dry," but is to be connected with the verb adverbially, and is simply placed at the end of the sentence for the sake of emphasis (Ges., Maurer, and Strauss). This will be the end of the Assyrians, because he who meditates evil against Jehovah has come forth out of Nineveh. In &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; Nineveh is addressed, the representative of the imperial power of Assyria, which set itself to destroy the Israelitish kingdom of God. It might indeed be objected to this explanation of the verse, that the words in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-13.htm">Nahum 1:13</a> are addressed to Zion or Judah, whereas Nineveh or Asshur is spoken of both in what precedes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-8.htm">Nahum 1:8</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>) and in what follows (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-12.htm">Nahum 1:12</a>) in the third person. On this ground Hoelem. and Strauss refer &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; also to Judah, and adopt this explanation: "from thee (Judah) will the enemy who has hitherto oppressed thee have gone away" (taking &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; as fut. exact., and &#1497;&#1510;&#1488; &#1502;&#1503; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-17.htm">Isaiah 49:17</a>). But this view does not suit the context. After the utter destruction of the enemy has been predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/1-10.htm">Nahum 1:10</a>, we do not expect to find the statement that it will have gone away from Judah, especially as there is nothing said in what precedes about any invasion of Judah. The meditation of evil against Jehovah refers to the design of the Assyrian conquerors to destroy the kingdom of God in Israel, as the Assyrian himself declares in the blasphemous words which Isaiah puts into the mouth of Rabshakeh (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-14.htm">Isaiah 36:14-20</a>), to show the wicked pride of the enemy. This address merely expresses the feeling cherished at all times by the power of the world towards the kingdom of God. It is in the plans devised for carrying this feeling into action that the &#1497;&#1506;&#1509; &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, the advising of worthlessness, consists. This is the only meaning that &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; has, not that of destruction. </body></html>
