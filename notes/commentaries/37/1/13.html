In attending to God's ministers, we must have respect to him that sent them. The word of the Lord has success, when by his grace he stirs up our spirits to comply with it. It is in the day of Divine power we are made willing. When God has work to be done, he will either find or make men fit to do it. Every one helped, as his ability was; and this they did with a regard to the Lord as their God. Those who have lost time, need to redeem time; and the longer we have loitered in folly, the more haste we should make. God met them in a way of mercy. Those who work for him, have him with them; and if he be for us, who can be against us? This should stir us up to be diligent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/haggai/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Haggai, the Lord's messenger - Malachi, whose own name was framed to express that he was "the Lord's messenger," and Haggai alone use the title, as the title of a prophet; perhaps as forerunners of the great prophet whom Malachi announced. Malachi also speaks of the priest, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a> "the messenger of the Lord of hosts," and prophesies of John Baptist as <a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/3-1.htm">Malachi 3:1</a> "the messenger" of the Lord, who should go before His face. Haggai, as he throughout repeats that his words were God's words, frames a new word  to express, in the language of the New Testament; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-20.htm">2 Corinthians 5:20</a> that he had an embassy from God; "in the Lord's message."<p>I am with you - All the needs and longings of the creature are summed up in those two words, "I with you." "Who art Thou and who am I? Thou, He Who Is; I, he who am not;" nothing, yea worse than nothing. Yet "if <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/8-31.htm">Romans 8:31</a>, God be for us," Paul asks, "who can be against us?" Our blessed Lord's parting promise to the Apostles, and in them to the Church, was, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-20.htm">Matthew 28:20</a>. "Lo I am with you alway, even to the end of the world." The all-containing assurance goes beyond any particular promise of aid, as , "I will help you, and will protect you, so that your building shall have its completion." This is one fruit of it , "since I am in the midst of you, no one shall be able to hinder your building." But, more widely, the words bespeak "His" presence in love, who knows all our needs, and is Almighty to support and save us in all. So David says <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>, "when I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me:" and God says by another <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-15.htm">Psalm 91:15</a>, I will be "with him in trouble," and by Isaiah Isa 43:2, "When thou passest through the waters," I will be "with thee." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/haggai/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>13. the Lord's messenger&#8212;so the priests (Mal 2:7) are called (compare Ga 4:14; 2Pe 1:21).<p>in the Lord's message&#8212;by the Lord's authority and commission: on the Lord's embassage.<p>I am with you&#8212;(Mt 28:20). On the people showing the mere disposition to obey, even before they actually set to work, God passes at once from the reproving tone to that of tenderness. He hastens as it were to forget their former unfaithfulness, and to assure them, when obedient, that He both is and will be with them: Hebrew, "I with you!" God's presence is the best of blessings, for it includes all others. This is the sure guarantee of their success no matter how many their foes might be (Ro 8:31). Nothing more inspirits men and rouses them from torpor, than, when relying on the promises of divine aid, they have a sure hope of a successful issue [Calvin].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/haggai/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Then; </span> when the people showed their obedience, and the willingness of their minds, then God encourageth them by his prophet. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Messenger; </span> legate or envoy, the Hebrew word signifieth also an angel; but this is not surf, clout to prove their opinion, who dream that Haggai was not a man, but an angel in the form of a man; the word here used (arising from a word that signifieth to send, and paraphrased by a word that primarily signifieth to send as messengers are sent) doth speak an angel from his office and work, as he ministereth before the Lord, and runneth swiftly on his errand; it speaketh not the nature or essence of angels, as they are spirits.

Which some render "angel"; hence sprung that notion, imbibed by some, that he was not a man, but an angel; whereas this only respects his office, being sent of God as an ambassador in his name with a message to his people: he now observing what effect his prophecy had upon the people; they being convinced of their sin, and terrified with the judgments of God upon them, and fearing that worse still would attend them; in order to revive their spirits and comfort them, spake the words unto them which follow: and this he did <p>in the Lord's message unto the people; not of his own head, nor out of the pity of his own heart merely; but as a prophet of the Lord, having a fresh message from him to carry a promise to them for their comfort and encouragement: <p>saying, I am with you, saith the Lord; to pardon their sins; to accept their persons; to remove his rod from them; to assist them in the work of building the temple, they were now willing to engage in; to protect them from their enemies, and to strengthen them to go on with the work till they had finished it; a short promise, but a very full one: it was saying much in a little, and enough to remove all their fears, to scatter all their doubts, and to bear them up, and through all discouragements. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/haggai/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/haggai/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">messenger</span>] The word is that commonly used for an <span class="ital">angel</span> in the O.T., but its first and proper meaning is messenger. In the same way in the N.T., the same word (<span class="greekheb">ἄγγελος</span>) is used generally in its restricted sense for an angel, and occasionally in its wider sense for a messenger (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-27.htm" title="This is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, which shall prepare your way before you.">Luke 7:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/9-52.htm" title="And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.">Luke 9:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm" title="Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?">James 2:25</a>).

"He remembers his glorious ones: they stumble in their paths; they hasten to the wall of it, and the tortoise is set up. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>. The gates are opened in the rivers, and the palace is dissolved. <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-7.htm">Nahum 2:7</a>. It is determined: she is laid bare, carried off, and her maids groan like the cry of doves, smiting on their breasts." On the approach of the war-chariots of the enemy to the attack, the Assyrian remembers his generals and warriors, who may possibly be able to defend the city and drive back the foe. That the subject changes with yizko&#772;r, is evident from the change in the number, i.e., from the singular as compared with the plurals in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-3.htm">Nahum 2:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>, and is placed beyond the reach of doubt by the contents of <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-5.htm">Nahum 2:5</a>., which show that the reference is to the attempt to defend the city. The subject to yizko&#772;r is the Assyrian (&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-1.htm">Nahum 2:1</a>), or the king of Asshur (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>). He remembers his glorious ones, i.e., remembers that he has 'add&#305;&#772;r&#305;&#772;m, i.e., not merely generals (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;, lxx), but good soldiers, including the generals (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-18.htm">Nahum 3:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-13.htm">Judges 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/3-5.htm">Nehemiah 3:5</a>). He sends for them, but they stumble in their paths. From terror at the violent assault of the foe, their knees lose their tension (the plural ha&#774;l&#305;&#772;kho&#772;th is not to be corrected into the singular according to the keri, as the word always occurs in the plural). They hasten to the wall of it (Nineveh); there is &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1499;&#1498; set up: i.e., literally the covering one, not the defender, praesidium militare (Hitzig), but the tortoise, testudo.<p>(Note: Not, however, the tortoise formed by the shields of the soldiers, held close together above their heads (Liv. xxxiv. 9), since these are never found upon the Assyrian monuments (vid., Layard), but a kind of battering-ram, of which there are several different kinds, either a moveable tower, with a battering-ram, consisting of a light framework, covered with basket-work, or else a framework without any tower, either with an ornamented covering, or simply covered with skins, and moving upon four or six wheels. See the description, with illustrations, in Layard's Nineveh, ii. pp. 366-370, and Strauss's commentary on this passage.)<p>The prophet's description passes rapidly from the assault upon the city wall to the capture of the city itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>). The opened or opening gates of the rivers are neither those approaches to the city which were situated on the bank of the Tigris, and were opened by the overflowing of the river, in support of which appeal has been made to the statement of Diodor. Sic. ii. 27, that the city wall was destroyed for the space of twenty stadia by the overflowing of the Tigris; for "gates of the rivers" cannot possibly stand for gates opened by rivers. Still less can it be those roads of the city which led to the gates, and which were flooded with people instead of water (Hitzig), or with enemies, who were pressing from the gates into the city like overflowing rivers (Ros.); nor even gates through which rivers flow, i.e., sluices, namely those of the concentric canals issuing from the Tigris, with which the palace could be laid under water (Vatabl., Burck, Hitzig, ed. 1); but as Luther renders it, "gates on the waters," i.e., situated on the rivers, or gates in the city wall, which were protected by the rivers; "gates most strongly fortified, both by nature and art" (Tuch, de Nino urbe, p. 67, Strauss, and others), for neha&#770;ro&#772;th must be understood as signifying the Tigris and its tributaries and canals. At any rate, there were such gates in Nineveh, since the city, which stood at the junction of the Khosr with the Tigris, in the slope of the (by no means steep) rocky bank, was to some extent so built in the alluvium, that the natural course of the Khosr had to be dammed off from the plain chosen for the city by three stone dams, remnants of which are still to be seen; and a canal was cut above this point, which conducted the water to the plain of the city, where it was turned both right and left into the city moats, but had a waste channel through the city. To the south, however, another small collection of waters helped to fill the trenches. "The wall on the side towards the river consisted of a slightly curved line, which connected together the mouths of the trenches, but on the land side it was built at a short distance from the trenches. The wall on the river side now borders upon meadows, which are only flooded at high water; but the soil has probably been greatly elevated, and at the time when the city was built this was certainly river" (see M. v. Niebuhr, Geschichte Assurs u. Babels, p. 280; and the outlines of the plan of the ground oh which Nineveh stood, p. 284). The words of the prophet are not to be understood as referring to any particular gate, say the western, either alone, or par excellence, as Tuch supposes, but apply quite generally to the gates of the city, since the rivers are only mentioned for the purpose of indicating the strength of the gates. As Luther has correctly explained it, "the gates of the rivers, however firm in other respects, and with no easy access, will now be easily occupied, yea, have been already opened." The palace melts away, not, however, from the floods of water which flow through the open gates. This literal rendering of the words is irreconcilable with the situation of the palaces in Nineveh, since they were built in the form of terraces upon the tops of hills, either natural or artificial, and could not be flooded with water. The words are figurative. mu&#772;g, to melt, dissolve, i.e., to vanish through anxiety and alarm; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;, the palace, for the inhabitants of the palace. "When the gates, protected by the rivers, are broken open by the enemy, the palace, i.e., the reigning Nineveh, vanishes in terror" (Hitzig).

Aen. i. 481, and other passages), as an expression of violent agony in deep mourning (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-13.htm">Luke 18:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-27.htm">Luke 23:27</a>). &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;&#1503; for &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1497;&#1492;&#1503; is the plural, although this is generally written &#1500;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;; and as the &#1497; is frequently omitted as a sign of the plural (cf. Ewald, 258, a), there is no good ground for reading &#1500;&#1489;&#1489;&#1492;&#1503;, as Hitzig proposes. </body></html>
