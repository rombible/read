The ground of the awful threatenings is the word of Jehovah made known to the prophet. The reason for the doom predicted on such high authority, is the resistance and cruelty that were offered by these nations to the theocratic people, and, still more, their own moral offences, condemned by universal conscience. The denunciations begin with a judgment upon <span class= "ital">Syria,</span> the age-long enemy of Judah, sometimes confederate with Israel. Then he passes to Philistia, which had been a thorn in the side of Israel and Judah from the days of the Judges till his own. Then he directs his gaze upon Phœnician cities, the emporium of the most extensive commerce in the world, Next he passes in review other three tribes, or nations, more closely related to Israel in blood, language, and proximity, and which, nevertheless, had often manifested an undying hatred of the covenanted people. After this Judah, his own tribe, does not escape. Lastly, the prophet gathers up all his strength to denounce Israel, then at the height of prosperity and splendour.<p>(1) See Introduction.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a></span>. <span class="ital">The words of Amos — </span>This inscription, and some similar ones prefixed to some of the books of the prophets, seem to have been formed by those who collected their writings together. <span class="ital">Which he saw — </span>Received by revelation; <span class="ital">concerning Israel — </span>Namely, the kingdom of the ten tribes, to which this prophecy chiefly refers; although the prophet briefly denounces God’s judgments against Judah, and also against the Syrians, Philistines, and other neighbouring countries. <span class="ital">In the days of Uzziah king of Judah — </span>Called Azariah in the second book of Kings, chap. 15. <span class="ital">And in the days of Jeroboam </span>— The great-grandson of Jehu. <span class="ital">Two years, before the earthquake — </span>Of which only this text, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm" title="And you shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal: yes, you shall flee, like as you fled from before the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and all the saints with you.">Zechariah 14:5</a>, make particular mention; but it is thought to be referred to, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-25.htm" title="Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcasses were torn in the middle of the streets.

He, like David, Peter, Paul, Matthew, was one of "the weak things of the world, whom God chose to confound the mighty." He was himself a herdsman only "among herdsmen;" but the words which he spake were not his own. They were words which he saw, not with eyes of flesh, but "with that vision wherewith words can be seen, the seer's vision in the mind." They were "words concerning," or rather "upon Israel," heavy words coming upon the heavy transgressions of Israel. The Hebrew word "saw" is not of mere sight, but of a vision given by God. Amos only says that they were "his" words, in order immediately to add, that they came to him from God, that he himself was but the human organ through which God spake.<p>Two years before the earthquake - This earthquake must plainly have been one of the greatest, since it was vividly in people's memories in the time of Zechariah, and Amos speaks of it as "the earthquake." The earthquakes of the east, like that of Lisbon, destroy whole cities. In one, a little before the birth of our Lord , "some ten thousand were buried under the ruined houses." This terrific earthquake (for as such Zechariah describes it) was one of the preludes of that displeasure of God, which Amos foretold. A warning of two years, and time for repentance, were given, "before the earthquake" should come, the token and beginning of a further shaking of both kingdoms, unless they should repent. In effect, it was the first flash of the lightning which consumed them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>THE BOOK OF AMOS Commentary by A. R. Faussett   <p>INTRODUCTION<p>Amos (meaning in Hebrew "a burden") was (Am 1:1) a shepherd of Tekoa, a small town of Judah, six miles southeast from Beth-lehem, and twelve from Jerusalem, on the borders of the great desert (2Ch 20:20; compare 2Ch 11:6). The region being sandy was more fit for pastoral than for agricultural purposes. Amos therefore owned and tended flocks, and collected sycamore figs; not that the former was a menial office, kings themselves, as Mesha of Moab (2Ki 3:4), exercising it. Amos, however (from Am 7:14, 15), seems to have been of humble rank.<p>Though belonging to Judah, he was commissioned by God to exercise his prophetical function in Israel; as the latter kingdom abounded in impostors, and the prophets of God generally fled to Judah through fear of the kings of Israel, a true prophet from Judah was the more needed in it. His name is not to be confounded with that of Isaiah's father, Amoz.<p>The time of his prophesying was in the reigns of Uzziah king of Judea, and Jeroboam II, son of Joash, king of Israel (Am 1:1), that is, in part of the time in which the two kings were contemporary; probably in Jeroboam's latter years, after that monarch had recovered from Syria "the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain" (2Ki 14:25-27); for Amos foretells that these same coasts, "from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness," should be the scene of Israel's being afflicted (Am 6:14); also his references to the state of luxurious security then existing (Am 6:1, 4, 13), and to the speedy termination of it by the Assyrian foe (Am 1:5; 3:12, 15; 5:27; 8:2), point to the latter part of Jeroboam's reign, which terminated in 784 B.C., the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah's reign, which continued down to 759 B.C.<p>He was contemporary with Hosea, only that the latter continued to prophesy in reigns subsequent to Uzziah (Ho 1:1); whereas Amos ceased to prophesy in the reign of that monarch. The scene of his ministry was Beth-el, where the idol calves were set up (Am 7:10-13). There his prophecies roused Amaziah, the idol priest, to accuse him of conspiracy and to try to drive him back to Judah.<p>The first six chapters are without figure; the last three symbolical, but with the explanation subjoined. He first denounces the neighboring peoples, then the Jews, then Israel (from the third chapter to the end), closing with the promise or restoration under Messiah (Am 9:11-15). His style is thought by Jerome to betray his humble origin; but though not sublime, it is regular, perspicuous, and energetic; his images are taken from the scenes in nature with which he was familiar; his rhythms are flowing, his parallelisms exact, and his descriptions minute and graphic. Some peculiar expressions occur: "cleanness of teeth," that is, want of bread (Am 4:6); "the excellency of Jacob" (Am 6:8; 8:7); "the high places of Isaac" (Am 7:9); "the house of Isaac" (Am 7:16); "he that createth the wind" (Am 4:13).<p>Hengstenberg draws an able argument for the genuineness of the Mosaic records from the evidence in Amos, that the existing institutions in Israel as well as Judah (excepting the calves of Jeroboam), were framed according to the Pentateuch rules.<p>Two quotations from Amos occur in the New Testament (compare Ac 7:42, 43, with Am 5:25, 26; and Ac 15:16, 17, with Am 9:11).<p>Philo, Josephus, Melito's catalogue, Jerome, Justin Martyr (Dialogue with Trypho, 22, quoting the fifth and six chapters of Amos as "one of the twelve minor prophets"), and the sixtieth canon of the Laodicean council support the canonicity of the book of Amos.   <p>CHAPTER 1<p>Am 1:1-15. God's Judgments on Syria, Philistia, Tyre, Edom, and Ammon.<p>1. The words of Amos&#8212;that is, Amos' oracular communications. A heading found only in Jer 1:1.<p>among the herdmen&#8212;rather, "shepherds"; both owning and tending sheep; from an Arabic root, "to mark with pricks," namely, to select the best among a species of sheep and goats ill-shapen and short-footed (as others explain the name from an Arabic root), but distinguished by their wool [Maurer]. God chooses "the weak things of the world to confound the mighty," and makes a humble shepherd reprove the arrogance of Israel and her king arising from prosperity (compare 1Sa 17:40).<p>which he saw&#8212;in supernatural vision (Isa 1:1).<p>two years before the earthquake&#8212;mentioned in Zec 14:5. The earthquake occurred in Uzziah's reign, at the time of his being stricken with leprosy for usurping the priest's functions [Josephus, Antiquities, 9:10.4]. This clause must have been inserted by Ezra and the compilers of the Jewish canon.The time when Amos prophesied, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld">Amo 1:1-2</span></span>. He showeth God's judgments upon Syria, <span class="bld">Amo 1:3-5</span>; upon the Philistines, <span class="bld">Amo 1:6-8</span> upon Tyre, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld">Amo 1:9-10</span></span>; upon Edom, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld">Amo 1:11-12</span></span>; upon Ammon <span class="bld">Amo 1:13-15</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="bld">The words:</span> the Holy Ghost doth in this expression comprehensively take in all the sermons, visions, and predictions which Amos preached and published; all the exhortations to duty, the menaces against sins, the warnings of dangers coming, and the promises of mercy to them that hear and obey his words: see <span class="bld">Hag 1:12</span>. And so what Jeremiah preached to his auditors are the words of Jeremiah, <span class="bld">Amo 1:1</span>; and the instructions and counsel of Solomon are the words of the Preacher, <span class="bld">Ecc 1:1</span>. Both the things spoken and the words wherein they are spoken are included. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Amos:</span> those who think this was father to the prophet Isaiah, either discern not the difference that is in the two Hebrew words, or pronounce hastily without considering what each is in the Hebrew, in which tongue these words have but two letters the same, i.e. M and O, the other are quite different; as also is the signification of each, for the one imports strength or might, the other imports a burden or heavy weight. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Among the herdmen, or shepherds, </span> but whether one of the meaner or one of the chief, whether a master herdman or a servant, the word imports the former, yet because the Scripture doth not say, we shall not inquire, since it conduceth little to our profiting, nor will it add to his authority, since it is God who sent him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Tekoa:</span> whether it belonged to Zebulun, Asher, or Judah is not much material, though this last be most likely, for, <span class="bld">2Ch 11:5,6</span>, we read of Rehoboam's building fortresses in Judah, among which Tekoa is mentioned. It was situate on a hill on the north of Judah, as a learned pen describeth it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">He saw; </span> received by revelation: this tells us that the things as well as words were to be understood, when it is said that these were the words of Amos. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Israel; </span> the kingdom of the ten tribes, revolted from the house of David, and now under the government of Jehu's great-grandson. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Uzziah; </span> called also Azariah, who was smitten with a leprosy for intruding into the priest's office, <span class="bld">2Ch 26:16,19</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judah; </span> including the tribe of Benjamin, and such of the Levites as did adhere to the house of David, the kingdom of the house of David. Jeroboam; not son of Nebat, but grandson of Jehu. Joash; who had some successes against Syria, according to the prophecy of Elisha, by which successes Israel was raised from a declining to a thriving, prosperous state. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The earthquake; </span> of which only this text, and <span class="bld">Zec 14:5</span>, do make particular mention, and where somewhat is spoken of it; which see. It is the tradition of the Jews, that this earthquake happened when Uzziah usurped the priest's work and offered incense in the temple, against which violation of Divine rites God testified thus from heaven, say they. Further than this we need not inquire in this matter. It was a great and dismal earthquake, and perhaps by this God did smite the winter and summer houses, as <span class="bld">Amo 3:15</span>; however, as it was foretold two years before it came, so we are sure it did come according to the time prefixed by the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/amos/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The words of Amos,.... Not which he spoke of or for himself, but from the Lord; all the prophecies, visions, and revelations made unto him, are intended: <p>who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa; which was not in the tribe of Asher, as Kimchi; nor of Zebulun, as Pseudo-Epiphanius (i); but in the tribe of Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/11-5.htm">2 Chronicles 11:5</a>. It lay to the south, and was six miles from Bethlehem. Mr. Maundrell (k) says it is nine miles distant, to the south of it; and, according to Jerom (l), it was twelve miles from Jerusalem; though he elsewhere (m) says, Thecua, or Tekoa, is a village at this day, nine miles from Aelia or Jerusalem, of which place was Amos the prophet, and where his sepulchre is seen: either there is a mistake of the number, or of Aelia for Bethlehem; the former rather seems to be the case; according to Josephus (n), it was not far from the castle of Herodium. The Misnic doctors (o) speak of it as famous for oil, where the best was to be had; near to it was a wilderness, called the wilderness of Tekoa; and Jerom (p) says, that beyond it there was no village, nor so much as huts and cottages, but a large wilderness, which reached to the Red sea, and to the borders of the Persians, Ethiopians, and Indians, and was full of shepherds, among whom Amos was; whether he was a master herdsman, or a servant of one, is not said. The word is used of the king of Moab, who is said to be a "sheepmaster", <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm">2 Kings 3:4</a>; he traded in cattle, and got riches thereby; and so the Targum here renders it, <p>"who was lord or master of cattle;'' <p>and Kimchi interprets it, he was a great man among the herdsmen; and so it was a piece of self-denial to leave his business, and go to prophesying; but rather he was a servant, and kept cattle for others, which best agrees with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-14.htm">Amos 7:14</a>; and so is expressive of the grace of God in calling so mean a person to such a high office. The word used signifies to mark; and shepherds were so called from marking their sheep to distinguish them, which seems to be the work of servants; and, in the Arabic language, a kind of sheep deformed, and of short feet, are so called: <p>which he saw concerning Israel; or, against Israel (q), the ten tribes, to whom he was sent, and against whom he prophesied chiefly; for he says very little of Judah. Words are more properly said to be spoken or heard; but here they are said to be seen; which shows that not bare words are meant, but things, which the prophet had revealed to him in a visionary way, and he delivered; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-1.htm">Isaiah 2:1</a>; <p>in the days of Uzziah king of Judah; who was also called Azariah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1</a>; <p>and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel; so he is called to distinguish him from Jeroboam the son of Nebat; this king was the grandson of Jehu; he was, as Jerom says, before Sardanapalus reigned over the Assyrians, and Procas Sylvius over the Latines: <p>two years before the earthquake; which was well known in those times, and fresh in memory. Zechariah speaks of it many years after, from whom we learn it was in the days of Uzziah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-5.htm">Zechariah 14:5</a>. The Jewish writers generally say that it was when Uzziah was smote with leprosy for invading the priest's office; and was in the year in which he died, when Isaiah had a vision of the glory of the Lord, and the posts of the house moved, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-1.htm">Isaiah 6:1</a>; and with whom Josephus (r) agrees; who also relates, that the temple being rent by the earthquake, the bright light of the sun shone upon the king's face, and the leprosy immediately seized him; and, at a place before the city called Eroge, half part of a mountain towards the west was broken and rolled half a mile towards the eastern part, and there stood, and stopped up the ways, and the king's gardens; but this cannot be true, as Theodoret observes; since, according to this account, Amos must begin to prophesy in the fiftieth year of Uzziah; for he reigned fifty two years, and he began his reign in the twenty seventh year of Jeroboam, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-1.htm">2 Kings 15:1</a>; who reigned forty one years, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-23.htm">2 Kings 14:23</a>; so that Uzziah and he were contemporary fourteen years only, and Jeroboam must have been dead thirty six years when it was the fiftieth of Uzziah; whereas they are here represented as contemporary when Amos began to prophesy, which was but two years before the earthquake; so that this earthquake must be in the former and not the latter part of Uzziah's reign, and consequently not when he was stricken with the leprosy. <p>(i) De Vita Prophet. c. 12.

And he showed them, that if God did not spare the other nations around them, who had lived as it were in ignorance of God compared to them, but for their sins punished them, then they could look for nothing, but a horrible destruction, unless they turned to the Lord in true repentance.

In Arabic <span class="ital">naḳad</span> denotes a species of sheep, found especially in the province of Baḥreyn, small and stunted in growth, with short legs and ill-formed faces (whence an Arabic proverb, “Viler than a <span class="ital">naḳad</span>”), but esteemed on account of their choice wool (see Bochart, <span class="ital">Hierozoicon</span> ii. xliv., p. 442 f., who cites the saying, “The best of wool is that of the <span class="ital">naḳad</span>”; or Lane’s <span class="ital">Arabic Lexicon</span>, p. 2837). In Arabic <span class="ital">naḳḳâd</span> is a shepherd who tends sheep of this kind; and the Heb. <span class="ital">nôḳçd</span> is a word of similar import. It may be inferred from this passage that there was a settlement of such <span class="ital">naḳad</span>-keepers at Tekoa: the occupation was perhaps hereditary in particular families (comp. the families following hereditary trades in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm" title="And the families of the scribes which dwelled at Jabez; the Tirathites, the Shimeathites, and Suchathites.

The word occurs once besides, of Mesha, king of Moab, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2 Kings 3:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Tekoa</span>] now <span class="ital">Teḳû‘a</span>, on the high ground of Judah, 12 miles S. of Jerusalem, and 6 miles S. of Bethlehem, from which, as Jerome (<span class="ital">Comm</span>. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm" title="O you children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the middle of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appears out of the north, and great destruction.">Jeremiah 6:1</a>) remarks, it is visible (“Thecuam quoque viculum in monte situm … quotidie oculis cernimus”). The ruins—dating principally from early Christian times—lie on an elevated hill, not steep, but broad on the top, and cover some four or five acres. South, west, and north the view is blocked by limestone hills; but on the east the prospect is open, though desolate; the land slopes away for nearly 18 miles to the Dead Sea, lying some 4,000 feet beneath, dropping first “by broken rocks to slopes spotted with bushes of ‘retem,’ the broom of the desert, and patches of poor wheat,” then to “a maze of low hills and shallow dales,” clad with a thin covering of verdure, the <span class="ital">Wilderness</span> or <span class="ital">Pasture-land of Tekoa</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-22.htm" title="And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set ambushes against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.">2 Chronicles 20:22</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-33.htm" title="Then Jonathan, and Simon his brother, and all that were with him, perceiving that, fled into the wilderness of Thecoe, and pitched their tents by the water of the pool Asphar.">1Ma 9:33</a>), afterwards to a “chaos of hills,” with steep and rugged sides, leading down rapidly to the shore of the Dead Sea (G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">The Book of the Twelve Prophets</span>, p. 74 f.). The northern half of this sea is visible from Tekoa, the level mountains of Moab forming the horizon beyond.

They have acted most corruptly, as in the days of Gibeah: He remembers their iniquity, visits their sins." The perfects in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a> are prophetic. The time of visitation and retribution is approaching. Then will Israel learn that its prophets, who only predicted prosperity and good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>), were infatuated fools. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; introduces, without k&#305;&#772;, what Israel will experience, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>. It does not follow, from the use of the expression '&#305;&#772;sh ru&#772;a&#774;ch, that the reference is to true prophets. 'Ish ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man of spirit) is synonymous with the '&#305;&#772;sh ho&#772;le&#772;kh ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man walking in the spirit) mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> as prophesying lies, and may be explained from the fact, that even the false prophets stood under the influence of a superior demoniacal power, and were inspired by a ru&#772;a&#774;ch sheqer ("a lying spirit," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>). The words which follow, viz., "a fool is the prophet," etc., which cannot possibly mean, that men have treated, despised, and persecuted the prophets as fools and madmen, are a decisive proof that the expression does not refer to true prophets. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498; is attached to the principal clauses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; ... &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. The punishment and retribution occur because of the greatness of the guilt of Israel. In &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; the preposition &#1506;&#1500; continues in force, but as a conjunction: "and because the enmity is great" (cf. Ewald, 351, a). Maste&#772;ma&#770;h, enmity, not merely against their fellow-men generally, but principally against God and His servants the true prophets. This is sustained by facts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>. The first clause, which is a difficult one and has been interpreted in very different ways, "spying is Ephraim &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;" (with or by my God), cannot contain the thought that Ephraim, the tribe, is, according to its true vocation, a watchman for the rest of the people, whose duty it is to stand with the Lord upon the watch-tower and warn Israel when the Lord threatens punishment and judgment (Jerome, Schmidt); for the idea of a prophet standing with Jehovah upon a watch-tower is not only quite foreign to the Old Testament, but irreconcilable with the relation in which the prophets stood to Jehovah. The Lord did indeed appoint prophets as watchmen to His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>); but He does take His own stand upon the watch-tower with them. Tsa&#770;pha&#770;h in this connection, where prophets are spoken of both before and after, can only denote the eager watching on the part of the prophets for divine revelations, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, and not their looking out for help; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; cannot express their fellowship or agreement with God, if only on account of the suffix "my God," in which Hosea contrasts the true God as His own, with the God of the people. The thought indicated would require &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, a reading which is indeed met with in some codices, but is only a worthless conjecture. &#1506;&#1501; denotes outward fellowship here: "with"  equals  by the side of. Israel looks out for prophecies or divine revelations with the God of the prophet, i.e., at the side of Jehovah; in other words, it does not follow or trust its own prophets, who are not inspired by Jehovah. These are like snares of a bird-catcher in its road, i.e., they cast the people headlong into destruction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; stands at the head, both collectively and absolutely. In all its ways there is the trap of the bird-catcher: i.e., all its projects and all that it does will only tend to ensnare the people. Hostility to Jehovah and His servants the true prophets, is in the house of the God of the Israelites, i.e., in the temple erected for the calf-worship; a fact of which Amos (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-17</a>) furnishes a practical example. Israel has thereby fallen as deeply into abomination and sins as in the days of Gibeah, i.e., as at the time when the abominable conduct of the men of Gibeah in connection with the concubine of a Levite took place, as related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>ff., in consequence of which the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated. The same depravity on the part of Israel will be equally punished by the Lord now (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>). </body></html>
