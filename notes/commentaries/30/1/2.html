The “pastures of the Shepherds” remind us of Psalms 23, and refers us to the prophet’s own home in the wilderness of Tekoah.

Those nearer judgments, however, of which he spake, were but the preludes of the judgments of the Great Day which Joel foretold, and of that last terrible voice of Christ, "the Lion of the tribe of Judah," of whom Jacob prophesies; "He couched, He lay down as a lion, and as a young lion; who shall raise Him up?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-9.htm">Genesis 49:9</a>. God is said to "utter His" awful "voice from Zion and Jerusalem," because there He had set His Name, there He was present in His Church. It was, as it were, His own place, which He had hallowed by tokens of His presence, although "the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Him." In the outset of his prophecy, Amos warned Israel, that there, not among themselves in their separated state, God dwelt. Jeremiah, in using these same words toward Judah, speaks not of Jerusalem, but of heaven; "The Lord shall roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-30.htm">Jeremiah 25:30</a>. The prophecy is to the ten tribes or to the pagan: God speaks out of the Church. He uttereth His Voice out of Jerusalem, as He saith, "Out of Zion shall go forth, the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-3.htm">Isaiah 2:3</a>, "where was the Temple and the worship of God, to shew that God was not in the cities of Israel, that is, in Dan and Bethel, where were the golden calves, nor in the royal cities of Samaria and Jezreel, but in the true religion which was then in Zion and Jerusalem."<p>And the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn - Perhaps, with a feeling for the home which he had loved and left, the prophet's first thought amid the desolation which he predicts, was toward his own shepherd-haunts. The well-known Mount Carmel  was far in the opposite direction in the tribe of Asher. Its name is derived from its richness and fertility, perhaps "a land of vine and olive yards." In Jerome's time, it was  "thickly studded with olives, shrubs and vineyards." "Its very summit of glad pasturcs."<p>It is one of the most striking natural features of Palestine. It ends a line of hills, 18 miles long, by a long bold headland reaching out far into the Mediterranean, and forming the south side of the Bay of Acco or Acre. Rising 1,200 feet above the sea , it stands out "like some guardian of its native strand;" yet withal, it was rich with every variety of beauty, flower, fruit, and tree. It is almost always called "the Carmel," "the rich garden-ground." From its neighborhood to the sea, heavy dews nightly supply it with an ever-renewed freshness, so that in mid-summer it is green and flowery . Travelers describe it, as  "quite green, its top covered with firs and oaks, lower down with olives and laurels, and everywhere excellently watered." "There is not a flower," says Van de Velde , "that I have seen in Galilee or on the plains along the coasts, that I do not find here again on Carmel. It is still the same fragrant lovely mountain as of old." : "Its varied world of flowers attracts such a number of the rarer vari-colored insects that a collector might for a whole year be richly employed." "It is a natural garden and repository of herbs."<p>Its pastures were rich, so as to equal those of Bashan. "It gives rise to a number of crystal streams, the largest of which gushes from the spring of Elijah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-19.htm">Jeremiah 50:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm">Nahum 1:4</a>. It had abundant supplies in itself. If it too became a desert, what else would be spared? "If they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-31.htm">Luke 23:31</a>. All, high and low, shall be stricken in one common desolation; all the whole land, fromm "the pastures of the shepherds" in the south to Mount Carmel in the North. And this, as soon as God had spoken. "He spake, and it was made." So now, contrariwise, He uttercth His Voice, and Carmel hath languished. Its glory hath passed away, as in the twinkling of an eye. God hath spoken the word, and it is gone.<p>What depended on God's gifts, abides; what depended on man, is gone. There remains a wild beauty still; but it is the beauty of natural luxuriance. "All," says one who explored its depths , "lies waste; all is a wilderness. The utmost fertility is here lost for man, useless to man. The vineyards of Carmel, where are they now? Behold the long rows of stones on the ground, the remains of the walls; they will tell you that here, where now with difficulty you force your way through the thick entangled copse, lay, in days of old, those incomparable vineyards to which Carmel owes its name." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. will roar&#8212;as a lion (Joe 3:16). Whereas Jehovah is there represented roaring in Israel's behalf, here He roars against her (compare Ps 18:13; Jer 25:30).<p>from Zion &#8230; Jerusalem&#8212;the seat of the theocracy, from which ye have revolted; not from Dan and Beth-el, the seat of your idolatrous worship of the calves.<p>habitations &#8230; mourn&#8212;poetical personification.

That is, the Prophet Amos, before described; he, being under divine inspiration, said as follows: <p>the Lord will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; not from Samaria, nor from Dan and Bethel, but from Zion and Jerusalem, where the temple of the Lord stood; and out of the holy of holies in it, where was the seat of the divine Majesty; and his voice being compared to the roaring of a lion, denotes his wrath and vengeance; and is expressive of some terrible threatening prophecy he would send from hence, by one or other of his prophets; perhaps Amos may mean himself; and who, having been a shepherd or herdsman in the wilderness, had often heard the terrible roaring of the lion, to which he compares his prophecy concerning the judgments of God on nations. Some think reference is had to the earthquake, as Aben Ezra; and which might be attended with thunder and lightning, the voice of God: <p>and the habitations of the shepherds shall mourn; that is, the huts or cottages they dwell in, erected for the more convenient care of their flocks; these, by a figure, are said to mourn, because exposed to the violent heat of the sun in this time of drought; or because forsaken by the shepherds; or it may design the shepherds themselves that dwelled in them, that should mourn because there was no pasture for their flocks, the grass being dried up, and withered away: and indeed it may be rendered, "the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn" (s); being destroyed by the drought, as the cattle upon them are said to mourn and groan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>; <p>and the top of Carmel shall wither; a fruitful mountain in the land of Israel; there were two of this name, one in the tribe of Judah, near which Nabal dwelt, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-2.htm">1 Samuel 25:2</a>; another in the tribe of Asher, near to Ptolemais or Aco; some think the former is meant, as being nearer Tekoa, and more known to Amos; others the latter, because Israel or the ten tribes are prophesied against; though Carmel may be taken for any and all fruitful places in the land; and the top or chief of it withering may signify the destruction of everything pleasant and useful. Some think Amos speaks figuratively in the language of a herdsman or shepherd, as artificers and mechanics do in their own way (t); and so by "shepherds" he means kings and princes; and, by their "habitations", their kingdoms, cities, towns, and palaces; and, by "Carmel", their wealth, riches, and precious things, which should all be destroyed; and to this agrees the Targum, <p>"the habitations of kings shall become desolate, and the strength of their fortresses shall be made a desert.'' <p>(s)  "pascua pastorum", Vatablus, Piscator, Grotius, Burkius.

The temple on Zion is Jehovah’s earthly abode; and from it the manifestations of His power over Israel or the world are conceived as proceeding.

Carmel—in the Heb. usually with the art., <span class="ital">the Carmel</span>, i.e. <span class="ital">the garden-land</span>—is the bold, bluff promontory, one of the most conspicuous of the natural features of Palestine, formed by a ridge of hills, some 18 miles long, and 1200–1600 feet high, stretching out far into the Mediterranean Sea, and forming the S. side of the Bay of Acre. It still bears the character which its name suggests. “Modern travellers delight to describe its ‘rocky dells with deep jungles of copse’—‘its shrubberies thicker than any others in central Palestine’ (Stanley)—‘its impenetrable brushwood of oaks and other evergreens, tenanted in the wilder parts by a profusion of game and wild animals’ (Porter), but in other parts bright with hollyhocks, jasmine, and various flowering creepers” (<span class="ital">D.B</span>[113][114] <span class="ital">s.v.</span>). The luxuriant forests of Carmel are often alluded to in the O.T.: ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-3.htm" title="And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will search and take them out there; and though they be hid from my sight in the bottom of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them:">Amos 9:3</a> (as a hiding-place), <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/35-2.htm" title="It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given to it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the LORD, and the excellency of our God.">Isaiah 35:2</a> (‘the majesty of Carmel’), <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-14.htm" title="Feed your people with your rod, the flock of your heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the middle of Carmel: let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.">Micah 7:14</a>; and (poetically) as shaking off their leaves, or languishing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-9.htm" title="The earth mourns and languishes: Lebanon is ashamed and hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel shake off their fruits.">Isaiah 33:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-4.htm" title="He rebukes the sea, and makes it dry, and dries up all the rivers: Bashan languishes, and Carmel, and the flower of Lebanon languishes.">Nahum 1:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[113] <span class="ital">.B.</span> … <span class="ital">Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible</span>, ed. 1, or (from A to J) ed. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[114] … <span class="ital">Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible</span>, ed. 1, or (from A to J) ed. 2.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall</span> <span class="bld">be dried up</span>] as the blood runs cold through terror, so Amos pictures the sap of plants and trees as ceasing to flow, when Jehovah’s thunder is heard pealing over the land.

The following clause is a repetition of <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-16.htm">Joel 3:16</a>; and Amos thus connects his prophecy with that of his predscessor, to show the unity of prophetic mission, and to warn the Jews that God's punishments are not directed exclusively on heathen nations.

Syria, Ammon, and Moab. <span class="cmt_word">Roar...  voice.</span> The thunder is the voice of God announcing his coming to judge. <span class="cmt_word">From Zion.</span> Not from Dan and Bethel, the seats of idolatrous worship, but from Jerusalem, the abode of his presence. <span class="cmt_word">The habitations;</span> better, <span class="accented">the pastures.</span> It is only natural that Amos, the shepherd, should use such terms to express the idea that the whole land, from Jerusalem on the south to Carmel on the north, should feel the vengeance of the Lord. <span class="cmt_word">Shall mourn;</span> explained by the following term, <span class="cmt_word">shall wither;</span> <span class="accented">i.e.</span> shall lose their verdure (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-11.htm">Jeremiah 12:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-3.htm">Hosea 4:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The top of Carmel.</span> This is the Mount Carmel, which stretches boldly into the sea on the south of the Bay of Acre, and is remarkable for its extreme fertility, its rich pastures, its vines, olives, fruits, and flowers. Thomson, 'The Land and the Book;' writes thus about it: "The celebrated ridge, called in the Bible Merest Carmel, and by the Arabs Jebel Kurmul, or Mar Elyas, in honour of Elijah, is an extension of the hills of Samaria, in a northwesterly direction, for a distance of about eighteen miles, terminating in the bold promontory of Carmel, which descends almost literally into the sea. It is steep and lofty where it overhangs the Mediterranean above Haifa,  and on that face which overlooks the Plain of Acre on the north, and that of Esdraelon towards the southeast. There is no special excellency in Carmel at the present day, whatever may be said of Sharon. Its name, Kurmul, or Kerm-el, signifies 'the vineyard of God;' but its vineyards have all disappeared. It was a glorious mountain, however, and a prominent landmark; according to Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-18.htm">Jeremiah 46:18</a>), Carmel was a resort of herdsmen. Amos says, 'The habitations of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither,' in the time of the threatened judgment, and this implies that its pastures were not ordinarily liable to wither. This may, in part, have been occasioned by the heavy dews which its lofty elevation, so near the sea, causes to distil nightly upon its thirsty head. I found it quite green and flowery in midsummer. It was a noble pasture field, and, in reference to that characteristic, Micah utters his sweet prayer, 'Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage, which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel; let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.'" <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>"The days of visitation are come, the days of retribution are come; Israel will learn: a fool the prophet, a madman the man of spirit, for the greatness of thy guilt, and the great enmity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>. A spy is Ephraim with my God: the prophet a snare of the bird-catcher in all his ways, enmity in the house of his God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-9.htm">Hosea 9:9</a>. They have acted most corruptly, as in the days of Gibeah: He remembers their iniquity, visits their sins." The perfects in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm">Hosea 9:7</a> are prophetic. The time of visitation and retribution is approaching. Then will Israel learn that its prophets, who only predicted prosperity and good (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>), were infatuated fools. &#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; introduces, without k&#305;&#772;, what Israel will experience, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-2.htm">Hosea 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-12.htm">Amos 5:12</a>. It does not follow, from the use of the expression '&#305;&#772;sh ru&#772;a&#774;ch, that the reference is to true prophets. 'Ish ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man of spirit) is synonymous with the '&#305;&#772;sh ho&#772;le&#772;kh ru&#772;a&#774;ch (a man walking in the spirit) mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-11.htm">Micah 2:11</a> as prophesying lies, and may be explained from the fact, that even the false prophets stood under the influence of a superior demoniacal power, and were inspired by a ru&#772;a&#774;ch sheqer ("a lying spirit," <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-22.htm">1 Kings 22:22</a>). The words which follow, viz., "a fool is the prophet," etc., which cannot possibly mean, that men have treated, despised, and persecuted the prophets as fools and madmen, are a decisive proof that the expression does not refer to true prophets. &#1506;&#1500; &#1512;&#1489; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1498; is attached to the principal clauses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; ... &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;. The punishment and retribution occur because of the greatness of the guilt of Israel. In &#1493;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492; the preposition &#1506;&#1500; continues in force, but as a conjunction: "and because the enmity is great" (cf. Ewald, 351, a). Maste&#772;ma&#770;h, enmity, not merely against their fellow-men generally, but principally against God and His servants the true prophets. This is sustained by facts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-8.htm">Hosea 9:8</a>. The first clause, which is a difficult one and has been interpreted in very different ways, "spying is Ephraim &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;" (with or by my God), cannot contain the thought that Ephraim, the tribe, is, according to its true vocation, a watchman for the rest of the people, whose duty it is to stand with the Lord upon the watch-tower and warn Israel when the Lord threatens punishment and judgment (Jerome, Schmidt); for the idea of a prophet standing with Jehovah upon a watch-tower is not only quite foreign to the Old Testament, but irreconcilable with the relation in which the prophets stood to Jehovah. The Lord did indeed appoint prophets as watchmen to His people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>); but He does take His own stand upon the watch-tower with them. Tsa&#770;pha&#770;h in this connection, where prophets are spoken of both before and after, can only denote the eager watching on the part of the prophets for divine revelations, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>, and not their looking out for help; and &#1506;&#1501; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497; cannot express their fellowship or agreement with God, if only on account of the suffix "my God," in which Hosea contrasts the true God as His own, with the God of the people. The thought indicated would require &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1493;, a reading which is indeed met with in some codices, but is only a worthless conjecture. &#1506;&#1501; denotes outward fellowship here: "with"  equals  by the side of. Israel looks out for prophecies or divine revelations with the God of the prophet, i.e., at the side of Jehovah; in other words, it does not follow or trust its own prophets, who are not inspired by Jehovah. These are like snares of a bird-catcher in its road, i.e., they cast the people headlong into destruction. &#1504;&#1489;&#1497;&#1488; stands at the head, both collectively and absolutely. In all its ways there is the trap of the bird-catcher: i.e., all its projects and all that it does will only tend to ensnare the people. Hostility to Jehovah and His servants the true prophets, is in the house of the God of the Israelites, i.e., in the temple erected for the calf-worship; a fact of which Amos (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/7-10.htm">Amos 7:10-17</a>) furnishes a practical example. Israel has thereby fallen as deeply into abomination and sins as in the days of Gibeah, i.e., as at the time when the abominable conduct of the men of Gibeah in connection with the concubine of a Levite took place, as related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/19.htm">Judges 19</a>ff., in consequence of which the tribe of Benjamin was almost exterminated. The same depravity on the part of Israel will be equally punished by the Lord now (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-13.htm">Hosea 8:13</a>). </body></html>
