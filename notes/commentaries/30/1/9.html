In Tyre, there was this aggravation, that it was a violation of a previous treaty and friendship. It was not a covenant only, nor previous friendliness only; but a specific covenant, founded on friendship which they forgat and brake. If they retained the memory of Hiram's contact with David and Solomon, it was a sin against light too. After David had expelled the Jebusites from Jerusalem, "Hiram King of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees and carpenters and masons; and they built David a house" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm">2 Samuel 5:11</a>. The Philistines contrariwise invaded him <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-17.htm">2 Samuel 5:17</a>. This recognition of him by Hiram was to David a proof, "that the Lord had established him king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people, Israel's sake" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-12.htm">2 Samuel 5:12</a>.<p>Hiram seems, then, to have recognized something super-human in the exaltation of David. "Hiram was ever a lover of David" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>. This friendship he continued to Solomon, and recognized his God as "the" God. Scripture embodies the letter of Hiram; "Because the Lord hath loved his people, He hath made thee king over them. Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, that made heaven and earth, who hath given to David a wise son - that he might build are house for the Lord" . He must have known then the value which the pious Israelites attached to the going up to that temple. A later treaty, offered by Demetrius Nicator to Jonathan, makes detailed provision that the Jews should have  "the feasts and sabbaths and new moons and the solemn days and the three days before the feast and the three days after the feast, as days of immunity and freedom."<p>The three days before the feast were given, that they might go up to the feast. Other treaties guarantee to the Jews religious privileges . A treaty between Solomon and Hiram, which should not secure any religious privileges needed by Jews in Hiram's dominion, is inconceivable. But Jews were living among the Zidonians (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm">Joel 3:6</a>). The treaty also, made between Hiram and Solomon, was subsequent to the arrangement by which Hiram was to supply cedars to Solomon, and Solomon to furnish the grain of which Hiram stood in need <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-7.htm">1 Kings 5:7-11</a>. "The Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as He promised him" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm">1 Kings 5:12</a>; and, as a fruit of that wisdom, "there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a covenant." The terms of that covenant are not there mentioned; but a covenant involves conditions. it was not a mere peace; but a distinct covenant, sanctioned by religious rites and by sacrifice.<p>"This brotherly covenant Tyre remembered not," when they delivered up to Edom "a complete captivity," all the Jews who came into their hands. It seems then, that that covenant had an special provision against selling them away from their own land. This same provision other people made  for love of their country or their homes; the Jews, for love of their religion. This covenant Tyre remembered not, but brake. They knew doubtless why Edom sought to possess the Israelites; but the covetousness of Tyre fed the cruelty of Edom, and God punished the broken appeal to Himself. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The Phoenicians, of whom, the Tyrians were the principal, are noted for being faithless and treacherous (f). "Punica fides" (g) was the same as "French faith" now; the perfidy of Hannibal is well known (h). Cicero (i) says the Carthaginians, which were a colony of the Tyrians, were a deceitful and lying people; and Virgil (k) calls the Tyrians themselves "Tyrios bilingues", "double tongued Tyrians", which, Servius interprets deceitful, as referring more to the mind than to the tongue; and observes from Livy the perfidy of the Phoenicians in general, that they have nothing true nor sacred among them; no fear of God, no regard to an oath, nor any religion; and which are the three or four transgressions for which they are said here they should be punished; for, besides their ill usage of the Jews, their idolatry no doubt came into the account: the god that was worshipped at Tyre was Hercules, by whom was meant the sun, as Macrobius (l) observes; and as there were several Heathen gods of this name, he whom the Tyrians worshipped is the fourth of the name with Cicero (m); the same is the Melicarthus of Sanchoniatho (n), which signifies the king of the city, by which Bochart (o) thinks Tyre is intended. To be a priest of Hercules was the second honour to that of king, as Justin (p) observes; and so careful were the Tyrians of this deity, that they used to chain him, that he might not depart from them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/10-4.htm">Jeremiah 10:4</a>; and a most magnificent temple they had in honour of him, and which, they pretended, was exceeding ancient, as old as the city itself, the antiquity of which they speak extravagantly of Herodotus (q) says he saw this temple, and which was greatly ornamented, and particularly had two pillars, one of gold, and another of emerald; and inquiring of the priests, they told; him it was built when their city was, ten thousand three hundred years before that time; but according to their own historians (r), Hiram, who lived in the days of Solomon, built the temple of Hercules, as well as that of Astarte; for though she is called the goddess of the Sidonians, she was also worshipped by the Tyrians; as he also ornamented the temple of Jupiter Olympius, and annexed it to the city, which deity also it seems had worship paid it in this place. <p>(f) Alex. ab Alex.

Tyre, as the most important of the Phoenician cities, is taken as representing Phoenicia generally. For defensive purposes Tyre was strongly fortified; but the Phoenicians were not an aggressive people: they were devoted to commerce: Tyre was a ‘mart of nations’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-3.htm" title="And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.">Isaiah 23:3</a>), a centre of trade by land as well as by sea (see the striking picture of the variety and extent of Tyrian commerce in Ezekiel 27); hence her relations with the Hebrews, as with her neighbours generally, were peaceful. The Tyrians were also celebrated for skill in artistic work: Hiram, king of Tyre, sent Tyrian workmen to build a palace for David; a formal treaty was concluded between Hiram and Solomon; Tyrian builders prepared timber and stones for the Temple; and a Tyrian artist designed and cast the chief ornaments and vessels of metal belonging to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/5-11.htm" title="And Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and carpenters, and masons: and they built David an house.">2 Samuel 5:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/5-1.htm" title="And Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon; for he had heard that they had anointed him king in the room of his father: for Hiram was ever a lover of David....">1 Kings 5:1-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-18.htm" title="And Solomon's builders and Hiram's builders did hew them, and the stone squarers: so they prepared timber and stones to build the house.">1 Kings 5:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_kings/7-13.htm" title="And king Solomon sent and fetched Hiram out of Tyre....">1 Kings 7:13-45</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">because they delivered up</span> <span class="bld">entire populations</span> <span class="ital">to Edom</span>] The charge is similar to that brought against the Philistines, <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6</a></span>; the Tyrians however are not accused of <span class="ital">taking</span> captives, but only of delivering them to others, i.e. of acting as agents for those who actually took them. For the Tyrians taking part in the trade of slaves, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-13.htm" title="Javan, Tubal, and Meshech, they were your merchants: they traded the persons of men and vessels of brass in your market.">Ezekiel 27:13</a>; and see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-6.htm" title="The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have you sold to the Grecians, that you might remove them far from their border.">Joel 3:6</a>.

The allusion is commonly supposed to be to the league, or ‘covenant,’ concluded between Hiram and Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-12.htm" title="And the LORD gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him: and there was peace between Hiram and Solomon; and they two made a league together.">1 Kings 5:12</a> (for ‘brother’ used figuratively of one joined in amity to another, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/9-13.htm" title="And he said, What cities are these which you have given me, my brother?

And he said, Is he yet alive? he is my brother.">1 Kings 20:32</a>); but it is scarcely likely that the crowning offence of Tyre should be forgetfulness of a treaty entered into nearly 300 years previously; more probably the reference is to the way in which, repudiating some alliance formed with other Phoenician towns, the Tyrians were the means of procuring slaves from them for Edom. As <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a> shews, Amos does not restrict his censure to wrongs perpetrated against Israel: it is the rights common to humanity at large, which he vindicates and defends.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Isaiah (ch. 23), Jeremiah, at least incidentally (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-22.htm" title="And all the kings of Tyrus, and all the kings of Zidon, and the kings of the isles which are beyond the sea,">Jeremiah 25:22</a>), Ezekiel (ch. 26–28), Zechariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-3.htm" title="And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.">Zechariah 9:3</a> f.), all foretell the ruin of Tyre; but it was long before it was accomplished. The Tyrians, it seems, escaped as a rule the hostility of the Assyrians by acquiescing in a condition of dependence and by timely payment of tribute. Thus Asshurnazirpal (b.c. 885–860) boasts of marching with his army as far as the “great sea of the West,” and receiving tribute from Tyre, Sidon, Gebal, and Arvæd; but he claims no conquest by arms (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[121][122], p. 157; <span class="ital">R.P</span>[123][124] iii. 73 f.). Shalmaneser II. receives tribute in his 18th and 21st years (b.c. 842, 839) from Tyre and Sidon (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[125][126], p. 207, 210; <span class="ital">R.P</span>[127][128] iv. 44 f.),—in the former year, together with that of <span class="ital">Jehu</span>, Hiram, king of Tyre, pays tribute to Tiglath-pileser in 734 (<span class="ital">ib.</span> p. 253). Shalmaneser IV. besieged Tyre for five years, but it does not appear that he took it. Both Esarhaddon and Asshurbanipal name “Baal of Tyre” among their tributaries (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[129][130], p. 356). Tyre sustained a long siege—according to Josephus one of 13 years—at the hands of Nebuchadnezzar; but it is not stated whether he captured it,—Ezekiel, in his allusion (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-18.htm" title="Son of man, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyrus: every head was made bald, and every shoulder was peeled: yet had he no wages, nor his army, for Tyrus, for the service that he had served against it:">Ezekiel 29:18</a>), implies that he did not. In the subsequent centuries the greatest blow which befel Tyre was its capture, after a seven months’ siege, by Alexander the Great, when 30,000 of its inhabitants were sold into slavery. It recovered itself, however, and continued for long afterwards to be an important naval and commercial city: Jerome (c. a.d. 400) describes it as <span class="ital">Phoenices nobilissima et pulcherrima civitas</span>, and says that mercantile transactions of nearly all nations were carried on in it. The final blow was not given to Tyre till a.d. 1291, when it was taken by the Saracens; and since then the site of the once populous and thriving city has been little more than a barren strand.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[121] <span class="ital">.A.T.</span> … Eb.

The perfects are a prophetic expression, indicating the certain execution of the threat. This is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-16.htm">Hosea 9:16</a> in figurative language; and the threatening in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>, is thereby strengthened. Lastly, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-17.htm">Hosea 9:17</a> the words of threatening are rounded off by a statement of the reason for the rejection of Israel; and this rejection is described as banishment among the nations, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-65.htm">Deuteronomy 28:65</a>. </body></html>
