Canneh was probably the same as Calneh <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>, the Calno of Isaiah Isa 10:9, and was, doubtless, situated in Mesopotamia, since it is joined with cities that are known to have been there (compare also <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-9.htm">Ezekiel 31:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>). All these passages demonstrate that there was such a country, and prove also that it was either in Mesopotamia, or in a country adjacent to Mesopotamia. It is not, however, possible now to designate its exact boundaries.<p>In Telassar - This place is nowhere else mentioned in the Scriptures. Nothing, therefore, is known of its situation. The connection demands that it should be in Mesopotamia. The names of ancient places were so often lost or changed that it is often impossible to fix their exact locality. <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>I will also break the bar of Damascus - In the East, every city was fortified; the gates of the stronger cities were cased in iron, that they might not be set on fire by the enemy; they were fastened within with bars of brass <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-13.htm">1 Kings 4:13</a> or iron (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-16.htm">Psalm 107:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-2.htm">Isaiah 45:2</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/48-14.htm">Isaiah 48:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-3.htm">Jeremiah 51:3</a> O). They were flanked with towers, and built over, so that what was naturally the weakest point and the readiest access to an enemy became the strongest defense. In Hauran the huge doors and gates of a single stone 9 and 10 feet high , and 1 12 foot thick , are still extant, and "the place for the ponderous bars," proportioned to such gates, "may yet be seen." The walls were loosened with the battering-ram, or scaled by mounds: the strong gate was seldom attacked; but, when a breach was made, was thrown open from within. The "breaking of the bar" laid open the city to the enemy, to go in and come out at his will. The whole strength of the kingdom of Damascus lay in the capital. It was itself the seat of the empire and was the empire itself. God says then, that He Himself would shiver all their means of resistance, whatever could hinder the inroad of the enemy.<p>And cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven - Literally, "from the vale of vanity," the "Bik'ah" being a broad vale between hills . Here it is doubtless the rich and beautiful valley, still called el-bukaa by the Arabs, La Boquea by William of Tyre , lying between Lebanon and Anti-libanus, the old Coele-Syria in its narrowest sense. It is, on high ground, the continuation of that long deep valley which, along the Jordan, the Dead sea, and the Arabah, reaches to the Red Sea. lts extreme length, from its southern close at Kal'at-esh-shakif to Hums (Emesa) has been counted at 7 days journey ; it narrows toward its southern extremity, expands at its northern, yet it cannot any how be said to lose its character of a valley until 10 miles north of Riblah .<p>Midway, on its ," was Baalbek, or Heliopolis, where the Egyptian worship is said to have been brought of old times from their "city of the sun ." Baalbek, as the ruins still attest, was full of the worship of the sun. But the whole of that beautiful range, "a magnificent vista" , it has been said, "carpeted with verdure and beauty" , "a gem lying deep in its valley of mountains," was a citadel of idolatry. The name Baal-Hermon connects Mount Hermon itself, the snow-capped height which so towers over its southeast extremity, with the worship of Baal or the sun, and that, from the time of the Judges Jdg 3:3. The name Baal-gad connects "the valley of Lebanon," that is, most probably the south end of the great valley, with the same worship, anterior to Joshua Jos 11:17; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/12-7.htm">Joshua 12:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. bar of Damascus&#8212;that is, the bar of its gates (compare Jer 51:30).<p>the inhabitant&#8212;singular for plural, "inhabitants." Henderson, because of the parallel, "him that holdeth the scepter," translates, "the ruler." But the parallelism is that of one clause complementing the other, "the inhabitant" or subject here answering to "him that holdeth the scepter" or ruler there, both ruler and subject alike being cut off.<p>Aven&#8212;the same as Oon or Un, a delightful valley, four hours' journey from Damascus, towards the desert. Proverbial in the East as a place of delight [Josephus Abassus]. It is here parallel to "Eden," which also means "pleasantness"; situated at Lebanon. As Josephus Abassus is a doubtful authority, perhaps the reference may be rather to the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon, called El-Bekaa, where are the ruins of the Baal-bek temple of the sun; so the Septuagint renders it On, the same name as the city in Egypt bears, dedicated to the sun-worship (Ge 41:45; Heliopolis, "the city of the sun," Eze 30:17, Margin). It is termed by Amos "the valley of Aven," or "vanity," from the worship of idols in it.<p>Kir&#8212;a region subject to Assyria (Isa 22:6) in Iberia, the same as that called now in Armenian Kur, lying by the river Cyrus which empties itself into the Caspian Sea. Tiglath-pileser fulfilled this prophecy when Ahaz applied for help to him against Rezin king of Syria, and the Assyrian king took Damascus, slew Rezin, and carried away its people captive to Kir.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I, </span> the mighty God, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-4.htm" title="But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall devour the palaces of Benhadad.">Amos 1:4</a></span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">will break, </span> weaken and shake into pieces, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the bar; </span> literally, the bar with which the city gates were shut, and both fastened and strengthened, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-3.htm" title="And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went away with them, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders, and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before Hebron.">Judges 16:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-3.htm" title="And I said to them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one to be over against his house.">Nehemiah 7:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-16.htm" title="For he has broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.">Psalm 107:16</a></span>.

Or bars, the singular for the plural, by which the gates of the city were barred; and, being broken, the gates would be easily opened, and way made for the enemy to pass into the city and spoil it; or it may signify the whole strength and all the fortifications of it. So the Targum, <p>"I will break the strength of Damascus:'' <p>and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven; or, "of an idol", as the Vulgate Latin version. It is thought to be some place where idols were worshipped by the Syrians; their gods were the gods of the valleys, which they denied the God of Israel to be, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-23.htm">1 Kings 20:23</a>. Mr. Maundrell (g) says, that near Damascus there is a plain still called the valley of Bocat, and which he thinks is the same with this Bicataven, as it is in the Hebrew text; and which lies between Libanus and Antilibanus, near to the city, of Heliopolis and the Septuagint and Arabic versions here call this valley the plain of On, which Theodoret interprets of an idol called On. Father Calmet (h) takes it to be the same with Heliopolis, now called Balbec, or Baalbeck, the valley of Baal; where was a famous temple dedicated to the sun, the magnificent remains whereof are still at this day visible. Balbec is mentioned by the Arabians as the wonder of Syria; and one of their lexicographers says it is three days' journey from Damascus, where are wonderful foundations, and magnificent vestiges of antiquity, and palaces with marble columns, such as in the whole world are nowhere else to be seen; and such of our European travellers as have visited it are so charmed with what they beheld there, that they are at a loss how to express their admiration. On the southwest of the town, which stands in a "delightful plain" on the west foot of Antilibanus, is a Heathen temple, with the remains of some other edifices, and, among the rest, of a magnificent palace (i): Some late travellers (k) into these parts tell us, that <p>"upon a rising ground near the northeast extremity of this "plain", and immediately under Antilibanus, is pleasantly situated the city of Balbec, between Tripoli of Syria, and Damascus, and about sixteen hours distant from each.----This plain of Bocat (they say) might by a little care be made one of the richest and most fertile spots in Syria; for it is more fertile than the celebrated vale of Damascus, and better watered than the rich plains of Esdraelon and Rama. In its present neglected state it produces grain, some good grapes, but very little wood.--It extends in length from Balbec almost to the sea; its direction is from northeast by north, to southwest by south; and its breadth from Libanus to Antilibanus is guessed to be in few places more than twelve miles, or less than six.'' <p>It seems to be the same with Bicatlebanon, or the valley of Lebanon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/11-17.htm">Joshua 11:17</a>; and with that which Strabo (l) calls the hollow plain; the breadth of which to the sea (he says) is twenty five miles, and the length from the sea to the midland is double that: <p>and him that holdeth the sceptre from the house of Eden; that is, the king from his pleasure house; or it may be understood of the name of some place in Syria, where the kings of it used sometimes to be, and had their palace there, called Betheden; and it seems there is still a place near Damascus, on Mount Libanus, called Eden, as the above traveller says; and Calmet (m) takes it to be the same that is here spoken of: <p>and the people of Syria shall go into captivity unto Kir, saith the Lord; which last clause is added for the certainty of it, and accordingly it was punctually fulfilled; for in the times of Rezin, which was about fifty years after this prophecy of Amos, though Kimchi says but twenty five, Tiglathpileser king of Assyria came up against Damascus, took it, and carried the people captive to Kir, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>. The Targum and Vulgate Latin version call it Cyrene, which some understand of Cyrene in Egypt; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-10.htm">Acts 2:10</a>; but this cannot be, since it was in the hands of the king of Assyria; but rather Kir in Media is meant; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>; which was under his dominion; and so Josephus says (n), that he carried captive the inhabitants of Damascus into Upper Media. <p>(g) Journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem, p. 119, 120.

These temples, dedicated respectively to Jupiter and the Sun, are not of earlier date than the 2nd cent. a.d.,—the temple of Jupiter having been erected as a wonder of the world, by Antoninus Pius (a.d. 133–161); but the massive substructures are considered to date from a much earlier period, and to bear witness to the fact that a temple of the Sun had stood there from a distant past.

These suppositions are however, mere conjectures. The statements of Macrobius and Lucian may be nothing more than inferences from the fact of two celebrated temples being dedicated to a similar cult; and there is no independent evidence that <span class="ital">On</span> was a name of the Syrian Heliopolis. (The LXX. rendering here <span class="greekheb">τὸ πεδίον Ὦν</span> is not proof of it: for they represent On in Gen. and Ezek. by <span class="greekheb">Ἡλιούπολις</span>.) In view of the double fact that Coele-Syria was a <span class="ital">biḳ‘âh</span>, or broad vale, and that Baalbek, in this vale, was the old-established seat of an idolatrous worship of the Sun, it is not improbable that Amos may mean to allude to it; <span class="ital">possibly</span>, also,—though there is no proof that the place was <span class="ital">called</span> On,—the designation ‘Plain of Aven (idolatry)’ may have been suggested to him by the thought of the Egyptian On, just as the nickname Beth-Aven for Beth-el (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-1.htm" title="Hear the word of the LORD, you children of Israel: for the LORD has a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the land.">Hosea 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm" title="Therefore shall you fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with you in the night, and I will destroy your mother.">Hosea 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-8.htm" title="Blow you the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry aloud at Bethaven, after you, O Benjamin.">Hosea 5:8</a>; cf. on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm" title="But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.">Amos 5:5</a>) may have been suggested by the place Beth-Aven in the neighbourhood, a little to the east of Beth-el (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-2.htm" title="And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spoke to them, saying, Go up and view the country.

From these we learn that in his 13th year (b.c. 733), the king laid siege to Damascus, and that in (probably) the following year (b.c. 732), after ravaging the surrounding country, he took the city, and carried large numbers of its inhabitants into exile. The place to which they were deported is not, however, mentioned in the existing (mutilated) text of the Inscriptions. The situation of Kir is very uncertain. A people of the same name is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a> beside Elam, as supplying a contingent in the Assyrian army. It is generally supposed to have been the district about the river Kur, which flows into the Caspian Sea on the N. of Armenia; but (Schrader in Riehm, <span class="ital">H.W.B.</span>, s.v.) this region does not seem to have formed part of the Assyrian dominions in the time of either Tiglath-pileser, or Sennacherib; the <span class="ital">k</span> in the Assyrian Kurru (Kur) is also not the same as the <span class="ital">ḳ</span> (q) in ḳir. Others (as Furrer in Schenkel’s <span class="ital">Bibel-lex</span>.; Dillm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm" title="And Elam bore the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen, and Kir uncovered the shield.">Isaiah 22:6</a>) think of the place called by the Greeks <span class="ital">Cyrrhus</span> (now <span class="ital">Kuris</span>) about 30 miles N.E. of Antioch, which gave to the surrounding region the name of <span class="ital">Cyrrhestica</span>. Some region more remote from Damascus itself appears however to be required by the allusions in Amos; Cyrrhus, moreover, there is reason to suppose (Schrader, <span class="ital">l.c</span>.), was only so called by the Greeks after a place of the same name in Macedonia.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Additional Note</span> on Chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm" title="I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holds the scepter from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, said the LORD.">Amos 1:5</a> (<span class="ital">‘Eden</span>)<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The following are the principal identifications that have been proposed for ‘Eden (or Beth-‘eden). (1) ‘Edçn, as it is called in Syriac, or ’Ehden, as it is called in Arabic, a village some 20 miles N.W. of Baalbek, on the opposite (N. W.) slope of Lebanon, attractively situated on the side of a rich and highly-cultivated valley, near the cedars, described by Amira—the author of the first Syriac grammar published in Europe (1596, p. 59), whose native place it was—as “loci situ, aquarum copia, terrae fertilitate, aeris temperie, in toto Libano praestantissima; unde non immerito tali nomine est nuncupata” (quoted by Payne Smith, <span class="ital">Thesaurus Syriacus</span>, col. 2810). The accounts given by modern travellers fully bear out this description: Lord Lindsay, for instance (cited by Dr Pusey) speaks of the slopes of the valleys about it as “one mass of verdure,” with “the springs of Lebanon gushing down, fresh, cool, and melodious, in every direction.” The place is said to be at present a favourite summer resort for the wealthier inhabitants of Tripoli. (2) Bêt-jenn, at the foot (E.) of Anti-Libanus, about 12 miles N.E. of Banias, and 25 miles S.S.W. of Damascus, watered by the Nahr-jennâni, which, flowing down from Anti-Libanus, forms one of the two sources of the A‘waj (the Pharpar), the second great river near Damascus (Porter, <span class="ital">Damascus</span>, ed. 2, p. 117 sq.). (3) Jubb ‘Adin, a village situated in the hills, about 25 miles N.E. of Damascus, and 20 miles S.E. of Baalbek. (4) The place called by the Greeks <span class="ital">Paradisus</span>, identified by Robinson (<span class="ital">B.R</span>[213] III. 544, 556) with old-Jûsieh, far up the valley of Coele-Syria, near Riblah, some 30 miles N.E. of Baalbek—a spot described as being now, at any rate, remarkably “dreary and barren” (Porter, <span class="ital">Handbook to Palestine</span>, p. 577). (5) The ‘Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-23.htm" title="Haran, and Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad, were your merchants.">Ezekiel 27:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?">2 Kings 19:12</a> (= <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?">Isaiah 37:12</a>), which Schrader (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[214][215] p. 327) is disposed to identify with the <span class="ital">Bît-Adini</span>, often mentioned in the Inscriptions of Asshurnazirpal and Shalmaneser II., a district lying on both sides of the Euphrates, in the middle part of its course, between Bâlis and Biredschik, some 200 miles N.N.E. of Damascus.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[213] <span class="ital">.R.</span> … Edw.

The references are to the pagination of the German, which is given on the margin of the English translation.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>None of these identifications can be regarded as certain: and the grounds upon which some of them have been suggested are very insufficient. The name <span class="ital">Bêt-jenn</span>, for instance, was formerly supposed to be <span class="ital">Bêt el-janne</span>, i.e. “house, or place, of the garden (Paradise),” which bore the appearance of being an Arabic translation of Beth-‘eden; but this supposition appears not to be correct[216]. The Greek—or ultimately Persian—word <span class="ital">Paradisus</span>, again, does not mean a ‘Paradise,’ in our sense of the term, but merely an <span class="ital">enclosed park</span>. Jubb ‘Adin would seem to be a place of too little note to have been signalized by the prophet in such a connexion. On the whole, either (1) or (5) appears to be, relatively, the most probable. Bît-Adini (5) might indeed be thought to be too distant from Damascus; but it has been observed that thirty-two kings are mentioned as being in alliance with Ben-hadad (I.), in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-1.htm" title="And Benhadad the king of Syria gathered all his host together: and there were thirty and two kings with him, and horses, and chariots; and he went up and besieged Samaria, and warred against it.">1 Kings 20:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/20-16.htm" title="And they went out at noon. But Benhadad was drinking himself drunk in the pavilions, he and the kings, the thirty and two kings that helped him.">1 Kings 20:16</a>, and twelve ‘kings of the land of the Hittites,’ or of the coasts of the Mediterranean Sea, are mentioned as allies of the same king by Shalmaneser II. (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[217][218], pp. 202, 203); hence the allusion may not impossibly be to one or other of the subordinate kings who held rule under the suzerainty of the king of Damascus, and who, the prophet declares, will be involved with him in his fall. Perhaps there were various Aramaean settlements in Coele-Syria and Mesopotamia governed in this way; and the “plain of Aven” and “Eden”—whether this be the Syrian ‘Edçn, or Bît-adini—may have been mentioned as representing these. Others have supposed the allusion to be to a summer residence of the kings of Damascus themselves. It is impossible to speak more definitely for lack of the necessary data. We must be content to know that some place or other, connected politically with Damascus, and, no doubt, prominent at the time, is intended by the prophet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[216] See Robinson, <span class="ital">B.R.</span> iii. 447; Porter, <span class="ital">Damascus, l. c.</span>; Socin in Bädeker’s <span class="ital">Palästina und Syrien</span>, ed. 2, p. 283; all of whom write Bêt-<span class="ital">jenn</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[217] <span class="ital">.A.T.</span> … Eb.

Robinson ('Bibl. Res.,' 677) and Pusey refer the name to a valley between Lebanon and Antilibanus, a continuation of the Arabah, still called <span class="accented">Bukaa</span>, in the middle of which stood Baalbec, "the Temple of the sun of the valley," called Heliopolis by Greek and Roman writers (see 'Classical Museum,' 3:136). The LXX. Renders "On" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a> by "Heliopolis;" and On and Baal being both titles of the sun, and indeed synonymous, the introduction of "On" into this passage may be accounted for. <span class="cmt_word">Him that holdeth the sceptre.</span> The king and princes, as ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">From the house of Eden;</span> Hebrew, <span class="accented">Beth-Eden</span>, "House of delight;" Vulgate, <span class="accented">de domo voluptatis</span>; Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3be;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x39e;&#x3b1;&#x1fe5;&#x1fe4;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "out of the men of Charran." This last rendering arises from considering that the reference was to the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2.htm">Genesis 2</a>, which the translators placed in the region of Haran. The place in the text Keil supposes to be the Paradisus of the Greeks, which Ptolemy (5:15, 20) locates southeast of Laodicea. Schrader suggests a place on the banks of the middle Euphrates between Balis and Biredschich called <span class="accented">Bit</span>-<span class="accented">Adini</span> in inscriptions of Asurnasirhabal and Salmanassur II. But this seems to be a wrong locality (see 'Die Keilinschriften,' p. 327). The passage means that all the inhabitants of valley and city, king and peasant, shall be cut off. Shall go into captivity. The word implies that the land shall be "stripped" or "bared" of its inhabitants. Wholesale deportation had not hitherto been common in these regions. Kir has been identified with the country on the banks of the river Kar, which flows into the Araxes on the southwest of the Caspian Sea. It forms part of the territory known as Transcaucasia. From this region the Syrians originally emigrated (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-7.htm">Amos 9:7</a>), and back to this land a large body were carried when Tiglath-Pileser, some fifty years later, killed Rezin and sacked Damascus, as related in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-9.htm">2 Kings 16:9</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Saith the Lord.</span> This is the solemn confirmation of the prophet's announcement, and recurs in vers. 8, 15 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-3.htm">Amos 2:3</a>. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/9.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>It is very evident that this is what he has in his mind, and that he regards the apostasy of the ten tribes as merely a continuation of that particular idolatry, from the punishment which is announced in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-12.htm">Hosea 9:12</a>, as about to fall upon Ephraim in consequence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>.

The licentious worship of luxury will be punished by the diminution of the numbers of the people, by childlessness, and the destruction of the youth that may have grown up. &#1502;&#1500;&#1468;&#1491;&#1492;, so that there shall be no bearing. &#1489;&#1468;&#1496;&#1503;, the womb, for pregnancy or the fruit of the womb. Even (k&#305;&#772; emphatic) if the sons (the children) grow up, God will make them bereft, &#1502;&#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, so that there shall be no men there. The grown-up sons shall be swept away by death, by the sword (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>). The last clause gives the reason for the punishment threatened. &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; adds force; it usually stands at the head of the sentence, and here belongs to &#1500;&#1492;&#1501;: Yea, woe to them, if I depart from them, or withdraw my favour from them! &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; stands for &#1505;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, according to the interchangeableness of &#1513;&#1474; and &#1505; (Aquila and Vulg.). This view has more to support it than the supposition that &#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; is an error of the pen for &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; (Ewald, Hitzig, etc.), since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, to look, construed with &#1502;&#1503;, in the sense of to look away from a person, is never met with, although the meaning is just the same. </body></html>
