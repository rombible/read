These events are predicted under significant emblems; there is a day coming, when every thing amiss shall be amended. The fountain of this plenty is in the house of God, whence the streams take rise. Christ is this Fountain; his sufferings, merit, and grace, cleanse, refresh, and make fruitful. Gospel grace, flowing from Christ, shall reach to the Gentile world, to the most remote regions, and make them abound in fruits of righteousness; and from the house of the Lord above, from his heavenly temple, flows all the good we daily taste, and hope to enjoy eternally.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But - Literally, "and." Thus had Gaza done, and thus would God do; "I will send a fire upon Gaza." The sentence on Gaza stands out, probably in that it was first in power and in sin. It was the merchant-city of the five; the caravans parted from it or passed through it; and so this sale of the Jewish captives was ultimately effected through them. First in sin, first in punishment. Gaza was strong by nature and by art. "The access to it also," Arrian notices , "lay through deep sand." We do not hear of its being taken, except in the first times of Israel under the special protection of God <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-1.htm">Judges 1:1-2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/1-18.htm">Judges 1:18</a>, or by great conquerors. All Philistia, probably, submitted to David; we hear of no special conquest of its towns <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-1.htm">2 Samuel 8:1</a>. Its siege cost Alexander 2 months , with all the aid of the engines with which he had taken Tyre, and the experience which he had there gained. The Egyptian accounts state, that when besieged by Tothmosis III it capitulated . Thenceforth, it had submitted neither to Egypt nor Assyria. Yet Amos declared absolutely, that Gaza should be destroyed by fire, and it was so. Sennacherib first, then, after Jeremiah had foretold anew the destruction of Gaza, Ashkelon, and the Philistines, Pharaoh Necho "smote Gaza" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1</a>. Yet who, with human foresight only, would undertake to pronounce the destruction of a city so strong? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. fire&#8212;that is, the flame of war (Nu 21:28; Isa 26:11).

This city was about fifteen miles south of Askelon, and about four or five north of the river Bezor, and at a small distance from the Mediterranean. It was situated on an eminence, surrounded with the most beautiful and fertile valleys, watered by the above mentioned river, and a number of other springs; and at a further distance encompassed on the inland side with hills, all planted with variety of fine fruit trees. The city itself was strong, both by its situation, and by the stout "walls" and stately "bowers" that surrounded it, and built after the Philistine manner (r) Arrian also says (s), it was a great city built on high ground, and encompassed with a strong wall, and was distant from the sea at least two and a half miles; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/8-26.htm">Acts 8:26</a>. <p>(p) Bibliothec. tom. 2. l. 17. p. 526.

"Ephraim as I selected it for a Tyre planted in the valley; so shall Ephraim lead out its sons to the murderer. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a>. Give them, O Jehovah: what shalt Thou give him? Give them a childless womb and dry breasts." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-13.htm">Hosea 9:13</a> Ephraim is the object to &#1512;&#1488;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497; (I have seen), but on account of the emphasis it is placed first, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-11.htm">Hosea 9:11</a>; and &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with an accusative and &#1500; dna evi signifies to select anything for a purpose, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-8.htm">Genesis 22:8</a>. The Lord had selected Ephraim for Himself to be a Tyre planted in the meadow, i.e., in a soil adapted for growth and prosperity, had intended for it the bloom and glory of the rich and powerful Tyre; but now, for its apostasy, He would give it up to desolation, and dedicate its sons, i.e., its people, to death by the sword. The commentators, for the most part, like the lxx, have overlooked this meaning of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, and therefore have not only been unable to explain letso&#772;r (for a Tyre), but have been driven either to resort to alterations of the text, like letsu&#772;ra&#770;h, "after the form" (Ewald), or to arbitrary assumptions, e.g., that tso&#772;r signifies "palm" after the Arabic (Arnold, Hitzig), or that letso&#772;r means "as far as Tyre" (&#1500;  equals  &#1506;&#1491;), in order to bring a more or less forced interpretation into the sentence. The Vav before 'Ephraim introduces the apodosis to &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;: "as I have selected Ephraim, so shall Ephraim lead out," etc. On the construction &#1500;&#1492;&#1493;&#1510;&#1497;&#1488;, see Ewald, 237, c. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-14.htm">Hosea 9:14</a> the threat rises into an appeal to God to execute the threatened punishment. The excited style of the language is indicated in the interpolated mah-titteen (what wilt Thou give?). The words do not contain an intercessory prayer on the part of the prophet, that God will not punish the people too severely but condemn them to barrenness rather than to the loss of the young men (Ewald), but are expressive of holy indignation at the deep corruption of the people. </body></html>
