This may have occurred in the border warfare, in which defenceless Judæan villages were overpowered, and the inhabitants sold to the Oriental tribes through the medium of the Edomites.

And it is probable from this passage that they were guilty of some injustice and cruelty, beyond the usual practice of war, in making captives, perhaps taking the peaceable inhabitants and all without distinction, the old and infirm as well as the young and healthy: or, making these incursions when Judah and Israel were at peace with them. Or, perhaps, their cruelty consisted in selling those they made captives to the Edomites, whom they knew to be mortal enemies of the Jews, and consequently, they might reasonably suppose, would treat them with great severity and tyranny. <span class="ital">But I will send a fire, </span>&c. — What is here foretold respecting the destruction of the cities of the Philistines, was fulfilled by Hezekiah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm" title="He smote the Philistines, even to Gaza, and the borders thereof, from the tower of the watchmen to the fenced city.">2 Kings 18:8</a>.

Its situation was wonderfully chosen, so that, often as a Gaza has been destroyed, a new city has, if even after long intervals, risen up again in the same immediate neighborhood . The fragments of the earlier city became materials for the later. It was first Canaanite <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-19.htm">Genesis 10:19</a>; then Philistine; then, at least after Alexander, Edomite ; after Alexander Janneus, Greek ; conquered by Abubekr the first Khalif, it became Arabian; it was desolated in their civil wars, until the Crusaders rebuilt its fort ; then again, Muslim. In the earliest times, before the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Gaza was the south angle of the border of the Canaanites, from where it turned to the south of the Dead Sea. Even then it was known by its name of strength, 'Azzah "the strong," like our "Fort."<p>For a time, it stood as an island-fort, while the gigantic race of the Avvim wandered, wilder probably than the modern Bedaween, up to its very gates. For since it is said, "the Avvim dwelt in open villages as far as Gaza" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-23.htm">Deuteronomy 2:23</a>; plainly they did not dwell in Gaza itself, a fortified town. The description assigns the bound of their habitations, up to the furthest town on the southeast, Gaza. They prowled around it, infested it doubtless, but did not conquer it, and were themselves expelled by the Caphtorim. The fortress of the prince of Gaza is mentioned in the great expedition of Tothmosis III , as the conquest of Ashkelon was counted worthy of mention in the monuments of Raamses II . It was strengthened doubtless by giving refuge to the Anakim, who, after Joshua had expelled them "from Hebron" and neighboring cities, "and the mountains of Judah and Israel, remained in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod" <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/11-21.htm">Joshua 11:21-23</a>.<p>Its situation, as the first station for land-commerce to and from Egypt, whether toward Tyre and Sidon, or Damascus and the upper Euphrates, or toward Petra, probably aggrandized it early. Even when the tide of commerce has been diverted into other channels, its situation has been a source of great profit. A fertile spot, touching upon a track through a desert, it became a mart for caravans, even those which passed, on the pilgrim-route to Mekka, uniting traffic with their religion. Where the five cities are named together as unconquered, Gaza is mentioned first, then Ashdod <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. Samson, after he had betrayed his strength, was "brought down to Gaza" <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-21.htm">Judges 16:21</a>, probably as being their strongest fortress, although the furthest from "the valley of Sorek ," where he was ensnared.<p>There too was the vast temple of Dagon, which became the burying-place of so many of his worshipers. In Solomon's reign it was subject to Israel <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-21.htm">1 Kings 4:21</a>. After the Philistine inroad in the time of Ahaz <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>, and their capture of towns of Judah in the south and the low country, Shephelah, Hezekiah drove them back as far as Gaza <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/18-8.htm">2 Kings 18:8</a>, without apparently taking it. Its prince was defeated by Sargon , whose victory over Philistia Isaiah foretold <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-29.htm">Isaiah 14:29</a>. Sennacherib gave to its king, together with those of Ascalon and Ekron , "fortified and other towns which" he "had spoiled," avowedly to weaken Judah; "so as to make his (Hezekiah's) country small;" probably also as a reward for hostility to Judah. Greek authors spcak of it, as "a very large city of Syria" , "a great city" . Like other cities of old, it was, for fear of pirates, built at some distance from the sea (Arrian says "2 12 miles"), but had a port called, like that of Asealea , Maiuma , which itself too in Christian times became a place of importance .<p>Because they carried away the whole captivity - Literally, "a complete captivity;" complete, but for evil; a captivity in which none were spared, none left behind; old or young, woman or child; but a whole population (whatever its extent) was swept away. Such an inroad of the Philistines is related in the time of Jehoram <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>.<p>To deliver them up to Edom - Literally, "to shut them up to Edom," in the power of Edom, their bitter enemy, so that they should not be able to escape, nor be restored. The hands, even if not the land, of Edom were already dyed in the blood of Jacob "their brother" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-19.htm">Joel 3:19</a>. "Any whither but there," probably would cry the crowd of helpless captives. It was like driving the shrinking flock of sheep to the butcher's shambles, reeking with the gore of their companions. Yet therefore were they driven there to the slaughter. Open markets there were for Jewish slaves in abundance. "Sell us, only not to slaughter." "Spare the greyheaded;" "spare my child," would go up in the ears of those, who, though enemies, understood their speech. But no! Such was the compact of Tyre and Philistia and Edom against the people of God. Not one was to be spared; it was to be "a complete captivity;" and that, to Edom. The bond was fulfilled. "Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he too shall cry and shall not be heard" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/21-13.htm">Proverbs 21:13</a>. Joel mentions the like sin of the Philistines and Phoenicians, and foretold its punishment <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4-6</a>. That in the reign of Jehoram is the last which Scripture mentions, but was not therefore, of necessity or probably, the last. Holy Scripture probably relates only the more notable of those border-raids. Unrepented sin is commonly renewed. Those strong Philistine fortresses must have given frequent, abundant opportunity for such inroads; as now too it is said in Arabia, "the harvest is to the stronger;" and while small protected patches of soil in Lebanon, Hauran, etc. are cultivated, the open fertile country often lies uncultivated , since it would be cultivated only for the marauder. Amos renews the sentence of Joel, forewarning them that, though it seemed to tarry, it would come. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. Gaza&#8212;the southernmost of the five capitals of the five divisions of Philistia, and the key to Palestine on the south: hence put for the whole Philistine nation. Uzziah commenced the fulfilment of this prophecy (see 2Ch 26:6).<p>because they carried away &#8230; the whole captivity&#8212;that is, they left none. Compare with the phrase here, Jer 13:19, "Judah &#8230; carried captive all of it &#8230; wholly carried away." Under Jehoram already the Philistines had carried away all the substance of the king of Judah, and his wives and his sons, "so that there was never a son left to him, save Jehoahaz"; and after Amos' time (if the reference includes the future, which to the prophet's eye is as if already done), under Ahaz (2Ch 28:18), they seized on all the cities and villages of the low country and south of Judah.<p>to deliver them up to Edom&#8212;Judah's bitterest foe; as slaves (Am 1:9; compare Joe 3:1, 3, 6). Grotius refers it to the fact (Isa 16:4) that on Sennacherib's invasion of Judah, many fled for refuge to neighboring countries; the Philistines, instead of hospitably sheltering the refugees, sold them, as if captives in war, to their enemies, the Idumeans.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Three transgressions:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Gaza; </span> the principal city of the Philistines; all the rest are to be understood; and here the city is named, but the inhabitants are meant also with the city; ancient and strong, the seat of the Anakims, conquered by Judah, yet lost soon after to the old inhabitants. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will not turn away the punishment thereof:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">They carried away captive</span>: this refers to the inroad by the Philistines and Arabians made upon Judah in the days of Jehoram, the son of Jehoshaphat, the violence and cruelty of which is set forth <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the Ethiopians:">2 Chronicles 21:16</a>,17</span>, about A.M. 3116; and this is that which is here threatened, as a sin that should be punished. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Edom; </span> the posterity of Esau, who were inveterate enemies to the posterity of Jacob, and as ill neighbours are, so were these, the worst enemies the Jacobites had, as appears <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-12.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because that Edom has dealt against the house of Judah by taking vengeance, and has greatly offended, and revenged himself on them;">Ezekiel 25:12</a> Ob 10-14 Psa 137:7</span>.

Gaza was the southernmost city of the Philistines: it lay on and about a hill, rising 100 feet out of the plain, at three miles distance from the sea, and some 50 miles S.W. of Jerusalem. “Fifteen wells of fresh water burst from the sandy soil, and render possible the broad gardens, and large population,” which is said to number now about 18,000 souls. Gaza owed its importance to its position. It was a fertile spot on the edge of a great desert; and it commanded the route between Egypt and Syria. It became in consequence not only important strategically: it was also “an emporium of trade on the border of the desert, with roads and regular caravans,” on the one hand, to Jerusalem, Damascus, Tyre, &c., on the other hand, to “Petra and Elath on the gulf of Akabah, both of them places in Edom, and depots for the traffic with Arabia” (comp. G. A. Smith, <span class="ital">Geogr</span>., p. 184; <span class="ital">The Twelve Prophets</span>, p. 126).

The Lord had selected Ephraim for Himself to be a Tyre planted in the meadow, i.e., in a soil adapted for growth and prosperity, had intended for it the bloom and glory of the rich and powerful Tyre; but now, for its apostasy, He would give it up to desolation, and dedicate its sons, i.e., its people, to death by the sword. The commentators, for the most part, like the lxx, have overlooked this meaning of &#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, and therefore have not only been unable to explain letso&#772;r (for a Tyre), but have been driven either to resort to alterations of the text, like letsu&#772;ra&#770;h, "after the form" (Ewald), or to arbitrary assumptions, e.g., that tso&#772;r signifies "palm" after the Arabic (Arnold, Hitzig), or that letso&#772;r means "as far as Tyre" (&#1500;  equals  &#1506;&#1491;), in order to bring a more or less forced interpretation into the sentence.

The words do not contain an intercessory prayer on the part of the prophet, that God will not punish the people too severely but condemn them to barrenness rather than to the loss of the young men (Ewald), but are expressive of holy indignation at the deep corruption of the people. </body></html>
