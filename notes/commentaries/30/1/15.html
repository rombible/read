E.V. is supported by LXX., Targ., and context of the passage. So far we find the prophet denouncing the sin which trifles with blood, covenants, and ancient agreements, and recognising the responsibilities of race; but closer inspection shows in this, and in Amos 2, that the prophet condemns all violations of those natural laws and rights of which he regards Jehovah as custodian and executor.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:18-21 There shall be abundant Divine influences, and the gospel will spread speedily into the remotest corners of the earth.

When "he and his princes" were "gone into captivity," there was no one to make head against the conqueror, and renew revolts. Hence, as a first step in the subdual, the reigning head and those who shared his counsels were removed. Ammon then, savage as it was in act, was no ill-organized horde. On the contrary, barren and waste as all that country now is, it must once have been highly cultivated by a settled and laborious people. The abundance of its ruins attests the industry and habits of the population. "The whole of the country," says Burckhardt , "must have been extremely well cultivated, to have afforded subsistence to the inhabitants of so many towns." "The low hills are, for the most part, crowned with ruins." Of the  "thirty ruined or deserted places, which including Amman," have been even lately "counted east of Assalt" (the village which probably represents Ramoth-Gilead, "about 16 miles west of Philadelphia  that is, Amman) several are in Ammonitis. Little as the country has been explored, ruins of large and important towns have been found south-southeast. and south of Amman .<p>Two hours southeast of Amman, Buckingham relates , "an elevation opened a new view before us, in the same direction. On a little lower level, was a still more extensive track of cultivated plain than that even which we had already passed - Throughout its whole extent were seen ruined towns in every direction, both before, behind, and on each side of us; generally seated on small eminences; all at a short distance from each other; and all, as far as we had yet seen, bearing evident marks of former opulency and consideration. There was not a tree in sight as far as the eye could reach; but my guide, who had been over every part of it, assured me that the whole of the plain was covered with the finest soil, and capable of being made the most productive grain-land in the world - For a space of more than thirty miles there did not appear to me a single interruption of hill, rock or wood, to impede immediate tillage.<p>The great plain of Esdraelon, so justly celebrated for its extent and fertility, is inferior in both to this plain of Belkah. Like Esdraelon, it appears to have been once the seat of an active and numerous population; but in the former the monuments of the dead only remain, while here the habitations of the living are equally mingled with the tombs of the departed, all thickly strewn over every part of the soil from which they drew their sustenance." Nor does the crown, of a "talent of gold weight, with precious stones" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/12-30.htm">2 Samuel 12:30</a>, belong to an uncivilized people. Such hordes too depend on the will and guidance of their single Skeikh or head. This was a hereditary kingdom <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/10-1.htm">2 Samuel 10:1</a>. The kings of Ammon had their constitutional advisers. These were they who gave the evil and destructive counsel to insult the ambassadors of David. Evil kings have evermore evil counselors. It is ever the curse of such kings to have their own evil, reflected, anticipated, fomented, enacted by bad advisers around them. "Hand in hand the wicked shall not be unpunished" <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/11-21.htm">Proverbs 11:21</a>. They link together, but to drag one another into a common destruction. Together they had counseled against God; "king and princes together," they should go into captivity.<p>There is also doubtless, in the word Malcham, a subordinate allusion to the god whom they worshiped under the title Molech or Malchom. Certainly Jeremiah "seems" so to have understood it. For, having said of Moab, "Chemosh shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>, he says as to Ammon, in the self-same formula and almost in the words of Amos ; "Malcham shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together." Zephaniah Z<a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-5.htm">Ephesians 1:5</a> also speaks of the idol under the same name Malcham, "their king." Yet since Ammon had kings before this time, and just before their subdual by Nebuchadnezzar, and king Baalis <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-14.htm">Jeremiah 40:14</a> was a murderer, it is hardly likely that Jeremiah too should not have included him in the sentence of his people, of whose sins he was a mainspring. Probably, then, Amos and Jeremiah foretell, in a comprehensive way, the powerlessness of all their stays, human and idolatrous. All in which they trusted should not only fail them, but should be carried captive from them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15. their king &#8230; princes&#8212;or else, "their Molech (the idol of Ammon) and his priests" [Grotius and Septuagint]. Isa 43:28 so uses "princes" for "priests." So Am 5:26, "your Molech"; and Jer 49:3, Margin. English Version, however, is perhaps preferable both here and in Jer 49:3; see on [1138]Jer 49:3.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Their king; </span> or Milchore, or Moloch, the idol of the Ammonites, so it signifieth, as well as king.

Not only the common people that are left of the sword shall be carried captive, but their king also. This was, Baalis their last king, who was accessary to the murder of Gedaliah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-14.htm">Jeremiah 40:14</a>; whom the king of Babylon had set over the remnant of the Jews left in Judea; which might provoke him to send Nebuzaradan his general against him, who put his country to fire and sword, destroyed his chief city Rabbah, and carried him and his nobles into captivity. Some understand this of Milchom, or Mo, the god of the children of Ammon, who should be so far from saving them, that he himself should be taken and carried off; it being usual with the conquerors to carry away with them the gods of the nations they conquered; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>. So Ptolemy Euergetes king of Egypt, having conquered Callinicus king of Syria, carried captive into Egypt the gods he then took, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-8.htm">Daniel 11:8</a>; and it was usual with the Romans to carry the gods of the nations captive which they conquered, and to carry them in their triumphs as such; so Marcellus was blamed for rendering the city of Rome envied and hated by other nations, because not men only, but the gods also, were carried in pomp as captives: and of Paulus Aemylius it is said, that the first day of his triumph was scarce sufficient for the passing along of the captive statues, pictures, and colosses, which were drawn on two hundred and fifty chariots (k): <p>he and his princes together, saith the Lord: which is repeated, and especially the last words added, for the confirmation of it. The Septuagint, Syriac, and Arabic versions, read, "their priests and their princes", as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>. This was fulfilled five years after the destruction of Jerusalem, as Josephus (l) relates. <p>(k) Vid. Plutarch. in Vita Marcelli &amp; Aemylii. (l) Antiqu. l. 10. c. 9. sect. 7. Vid.

The verse is borrowed by Jeremiah, with slight changes, in his prophecy against the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm" title="Howl, O Heshbon, for Ai is spoiled: cry, you daughters of Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth; lament, and run to and fro by the hedges; for their king shall go into captivity, and his priests and his princes together.">Jeremiah 49:3</a>), “For their king shall go into exile, his priests and his princes together”—where the addition of ‘priests’ makes it probable that for <span class="ital">malcâm</span> ‘their king,’ we should read, with most of the ancient versions, <span class="ital">Milcom</span>, the name of the national God of the Ammonites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm" title="For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.">1 Kings 11:5</a>, &c.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/amos/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 15.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Their king;</span> Septuagint, <span class="greek">&#x3bf;&#x1f31;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span>. So Keil, Trochon, and others consider that the King of the Ammonites is meant. The Vulgate, with Aquila, Symmachus, the Syriac, and Jerome, retrains the word Melchous, or Melcham, which is the same as Molech, their god. This interpretation is favoured by passages in Jeremiah, of which one is evidently quoted from Amos, "For Malcam shall go into captivity, his priests and his princes together" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-3.htm">Jeremiah 49:3</a>); and the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-7.htm">Jeremiah 48:7</a>) is similar, with the substitution of "Chemosh," the god of Moab, for "Maleam." That the localized deity should share the fortunes of his worshippers is quite in accordance with the ideas of the time (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm">Isaiah 46:1, 2</a>). Probably Amos meant to include both notions - their "Malcam," whether king or god. should be carried into captivity, accompanied by the princes, all the chiefs, military and sacerdotal, so that no one should he left to head a future revolt. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The thoughts of <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-3.htm">Hosea 10:3</a> are carried out still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4-7</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-4.htm">Hosea 10:4</a>. "They have spoken words, sworn falsely, made treaties: thus right springs up like darnel in the furrows of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>. For the calves of Beth-aven the inhabitants of Samaria were afraid: yea, its people mourn over it, and its sacred ministers will tremble at it, at its glory, because it has strayed from them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-6.htm">Hosea 10:6</a>. Men will also carry it to Asshur, as a present for king Jareb: shame will seize upon Ephraim, and Israel will be put to shame for its counsel." The dissimulation of heart (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-3.htm">Hosea 10:3</a>) manifested itself in their speaking words which were nothing but words, i.e., in vain talk (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-13.htm">Isaiah 58:13</a>), in false swearing, and in the making of treaties. &#1488;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, by virtue of the parallelism, is an infin. abs. for &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, formed like &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, analogous to &#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-13.htm">Isaiah 22:13</a>; see Ewald, 240, b). &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514; &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;, in connection with false swearing, must signify the making of a covenant without any truthfulness in it, i.e., the conclusion of treaties with foreign nations - for example, with Assyria - which they were inclined to observe only so long as they could promise themselves advantages from them. In consequence of this, right has become like a bitter plant growing luxuriantly (&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;  equals  &#1512;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-17.htm">Deuteronomy 29:17</a>). Mishpa&#770;t does not mean judgment here, or the punitive judgment of God (Chald. and many others), for this could hardly be compared with propriety to weeds running over everything, but right in its degeneracy into wrong, or right that men have turned into bitter fruit or poison (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-12.htm">Amos 6:12</a>). This spreads about in the kingdom, as weeds spread luxuriantly in the furrows of the field (&#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1497; a poetical form for &#1513;&#1474;&#1491;&#1492;, like <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-13.htm">Deuteronomy 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/8-8.htm">Psalm 8:8</a>). Therefore the judgment cannot be delayed, and is already approaching in so threatening a manner, that the inhabitants of Samaria tremble for the golden calves. The plural &#8219;eglo&#772;th is used with indefinite generality, and gives no warrant, therefore, for the inference that there were several golden calves set up in Bethel. Moreover, this would be at variance with the fact, that in the sentences which follow we find "the (one) calf" spoken of. The feminine form &#8219;eglo&#772;th, which only occurs here, is also probably connected with the abstract use of the plural, inasmuch as the feminine is the proper form for abstracts. Be&#772;th-'a&#770;ven for Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>. Sha&#770;khe&#772;n is construed with the plural, as an adjective used in a collective sense. &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-5.htm">Hosea 4:5</a>) is emphatic, and the suffixes attached to &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; do not refer to Samaria, but to the idol, i.e., the calf, since the prophet distinctly calls Israel, which ought to have been the nation of Jehovah, the nation of its calf-idol, which mourned with its priests (kema&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, the priests appointed in connection with the worship of the calves: see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-5.htm">2 Kings 23:5</a>) for the carrying away of the calf to Assyria. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; does not mean to exult or rejoice here, nor to tremble (applied to the leaping of the heart from fear, as it does from joy), but has the same meaning as &#1495;&#1497;&#1500; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/96-9.htm">Psalm 96:9</a>. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; is still further defined by &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1491;&#1493;, "for its glory," i.e., not for the temple-treasure at Bethel (Hitzig), nor the one glorious image of the calf, as the symbol of the state-god (Ewald, Umbreit), but the calf, to which the people attributed the glory of the true God. The perfect, ga&#770;la&#770;h, is used prophetically of that which was as good as complete and certain (for the fut. exact., cf. Ewald, 343, a). The golden calf, the glory of the nation, will have to wander into exile. This cannot even save itself; it will be taken to Assyria, to king Jareb (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>), as mincha&#770;h, a present of tribute (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm">2 Samuel 8:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm">2 Samuel 8:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-1.htm">1 Kings 5:1</a>). For the construing of the passive with &#1488;&#1514;, see Ges. 143, 1, a. Then will Ephraim ( equals  Israel) be seized by reproach and shame. Boshna&#770;h, a word only met with here; it is formed from the masculine bo&#772;shen, which is not used at all (see Ewald, 163, 164). </body></html>
