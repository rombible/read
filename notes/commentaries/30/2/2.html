Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked.

It may have received a plural form upon some enlargement, as Jerusalem received a dual form, as a double city. The name is, in different forms, very common . In the plain or high downs of Moab itself, there were both Kiriathaim, "double city" and Kerloth <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-23.htm">Jeremiah 48:23-24</a>; in Naphthali, a Kiriathaim, (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-76.htm">1 Chronicles 6:76</a>, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/6-61.htm">1 Chronicles 6:61</a> in Hebrew)) or Kartan <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-32.htm">Joshua 21:32</a>; in Judah, the Kerioth <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/15-25.htm">Joshua 15:25</a> from where the wretched Judas has his name Iscariot; in Zebulon, Kartah <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/21-34.htm">Joshua 21:34</a> also, which reappears as the Numidian Cirta. Moab had also a Kiriath-huzoth, "city of streets" <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/22-39.htm">Numbers 22:39</a>, within the Arnon . This alone was within the proper border of Moab, such as the Armorites had left it.<p>Kerioth and Kiriathaim were in the plain country which Israel had won from the Amorites, and its possession would imply an aggression of Moab. Jeroboam II had probably at this time brought Moab to a temporary submission (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>); but Israel only required fealty and tribute of Moab; Moab appears even before the captivity of the 2 12 tribes, to have invaded the possessions of Israel. Kerioth was probably a new capital, beyond the Arnon, now adorned with "palaces" and enlarged, as "Paris, Prague, Cracow , "London, are composed of different towns. In Jerome's time, it had probably ceased to be .<p>Shall die with tumult - Jeremiah, when prophesying the destruction of Moab, designates it by this same name "sons of tumult <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-45.htm">Jeremiah 48:45</a>. A flame shall devour the corner of Moab and the crown of the sons of tumult." And probably herein he explains the original prophecy of Balaam, "shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of tumult" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-17.htm">Numbers 24:17</a>. As they had done, so should it be done to them; tumults they caused, "in tumult" they should perish.<p>After the subdual of Moab by Nebuchadnezzar, it disappears as a nation, unless indeed Daniel in his Prophecy, "Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Ammon shall escape out of his hand" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/11-41.htm">Amos 11:41</a> (Antiochus Epiphanes,) means the nations themselves, and not such as should be like them. Else the intermarriage with Moabite women <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/9-1.htm">Ezra 9:1</a> is mentioned only as that with women of other pagan nations which had ceased to be. The old name, Moabitis, is still mentioned; but the Arabs had possessed themselves of it, and bore the old name. Alexander Jannaeus "subdued"  we are told, "of the Arabians, the Moabites and Gileadires," and then, again, when in difficulty, made it over with its fortified places, to the king of the Arabians . Among the cities which Alexander took from the king of the Arabians , are cities throughout Moab, both in that part in which they had succeeded to Israel, and their proper territory south of the Arnon . <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Mesha, also, in a passage of his Inscription (lines 10–13), sufficiently interesting to extract in full, speaks of it in terms implying that it was a place of importance, possessing a sanctuary of the national god (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-29.htm" title="Woe to you, Moab! you are undone, O people of Chemosh: he has given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites.">Numbers 21:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-7.htm" title="Then did Solomon build an high place for Chemosh, the abomination of Moab, in the hill that is before Jerusalem, and for Molech, the abomination of the children of Ammon.">1 Kings 11:7</a>), and a royal residence: “And the men of Gad had dwelt in the land of Ataroth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-3.htm" title="Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,">Numbers 32:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/32-34.htm" title="And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,">Numbers 32:34</a>) from of old; and the king of Israel built for himself Ataroth.

And I brought back [<span class="ital">or</span>, took captive] thence the altar-hearth of Davdoh (?), and I dragged it before Chĕmôsh in Ḳeriyyoth.” From the fact that, notwithstanding its importance, it is not mentioned in the long enumeration of Moabite cities in Isaiah 15-16, and that conversely where Ar, the capital of Moab, is named, Ḳeriyyoth is not mentioned, it has been supposed by many that Ar and Ḳeriyyoth were different names of the same place. Its situation is uncertain, though, if it was identical with Ar, it will have lain somewhere on the N. or N.E. border of Moab, in the valley of the Arnon (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-9.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Distress not the Moabites, neither contend with them in battle: for I will not give you of their land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession.">Deuteronomy 2:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/2-18.htm" title="You are to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:">Deuteronomy 2:18</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and Moab shall die with tumult</span>, <span class="ital">with shouting</span>, and <span class="ital">with the sound of the</span> <span class="bld">horn</span>] The nation is personified, and pictured here as dying, under the assault of its foes, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-11.htm" title="And he shall spread forth his hands in the middle of them, as he that swims spreads forth his hands to swim: and he shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their hands.">Isaiah 25:11</a> it is pictured as drowning.

Trochon cites Virgil, 'AEneid,' 2:313, "Exoritur clamorque virum clangorque tubarum," "Rises the shout of men and trumpets' blare." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the carrying away of the golden calf the kingdom of Samaria also perishes, and desert plants will grow upon the places of idols. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>. "Destroyed is Samaria; her king like a splinter on the surface of the water. And destroyed are the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel: thorn and thistle will rise up on their altars; and they will speak to the mountains, Cover us! and to the hills, Fall on us!" &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is not an asyndeton, "Samaria and its king;" but Sho&#772;mero&#772;n is to be taken absolutely, "as for Samaria," although, as a matter of fact, not only Samaria, the capital of the kingdom, but the kingdom itself, was destroyed. For malka&#770;h does not refer to any particular king, but is used in a general sense for "the king that Samaria had," so that the destruction of the monarchy is here predicted (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>). The idea that the words refer to one particular king, is not only at variance with the context, which contains no allusion to any one historical occurrence, but does not suit the simile: like a splinter upon the surface of the water, which is carried away by the current, and vanishes without leaving a trace behind. Qetseph is not "foam" (Chald., Symm., Rabb.), but a broken branch, a fagot or a splinter, as qetsa&#770;pha&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a> clearly shows. Ba&#770;mo&#772;th 'a&#770;ven are the buildings connected with the image-worship at Bethel ('a&#770;ven  equals  Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>), the temple erected there (be&#772;th ba&#770;mo&#772;th), together with the altar, possibly also including other illegal places of sacrifice there, which constituted the chief sin of the kingdom of Israel. These were to be so utterly destroyed, that thorns and thistles would grow upon the ruined altars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). "The sign of extreme solitude, that there are not even the walls left, or any traces of the buildings" (Jerome). When the kingdom shall be thus broken up, together with the monarchy and the sacred places, the inhabitants, in their hopeless despair, will long for swift death and destruction. Saying to the mountains, "Cover us," etc., implies much more than hiding themselves in the holes and clefts of the rocks (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>). It expresses the desire to be buried under the falling mountains and hills, that they may no longer have to bear the pains and terrors of the judgment. In this sense are the words transferred by Christ, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, to the calamities attending the destruction of Jerusalem, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a> to the terrors of the last judgment. </body></html>
