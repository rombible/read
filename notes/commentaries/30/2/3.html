Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I will cut off the judge - The title "judge" (shophet) is nowhere used absolutely of a king. Holy Scripture speaks in several places of "all the judges of the earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-24.htm">Job 9:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/2-10.htm">Psalm 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-11.htm">Psalm 148:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/8-16.htm">Proverbs 8:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-23.htm">Isaiah 40:23</a>. Hosea Hos 13:10, under "judges," includes "kings and princes," as judging the people. The word "judge" is always used as one invested with the highest, but not regal authority, as of all the judges from the death of Joshua to Samuel. In like way it (Sufetes) was the title of the chief magistrates of Carthage , with much the same authority as the Roman Consuls . The Phoenician histories, although they would not own that Nebuchadnezzar conquered Tyre, still own that, after his 13 years' siege , Baal reigned 10 years, and after him judges were set up, one for two months, a second for ten, a third, a high priest, for three, two more for six, and between these one reigned for a year. After his death, they sent for Merbaal from Babylon, who reigned for four years, and on his death, they sent for Hiram his brother who reigned for twenty. The judges then exercised the supreme authority, the king's sons having been carried away captive. Probably, then, when Jeroboam II recovered the old territory of Israel, Moab lost its kings. It agrees with this, that Amos says, "the princes thereof," literally, "her princes," the princes of Moab, not as of Ammon, "his princes," that is, the princes of the king. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. the judge&#8212;the chief magistrate, the supreme source of justice. "King" not being used, it seems likely a change of government had before this time substituted for kings, supreme judges.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I will cut off, </span> by the sword of the enemy, the judge; the governor, i. e. every one of them; the singular being put for the plural, to intimate the destruction of all of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the midst thereof; </span> either of Kirioth the metropolis, or of every city in which were judges appointed to govern and minister justice to the people; and these should be cut off in these cities, and in the midst of their government. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The princes; </span> either by birth, or by office, or by excellent endowments, the chief among the Moabitish people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With him; </span> with the supreme governor, before threatened. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saith the Lord; </span> noting to us the certainty of the thing, the irrevocable sentence passed upon Moab, its king, princes, and judges, who being cut off, the people must needs perish, and come to nothing. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/amos/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof,....

One answer is that Moab was at this time subject to Jeroboam II., and hence there was no ‘king’ of Moab, but only an Israelitish deputy or governor. The terms of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm" title="He restored the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath to the sea of the plain, according to the word of the LORD God of Israel, which he spoke by the hand of his servant Jonah, the son of Amittai, the prophet, which was of Gathhepher.">2 Kings 14:25</a> (which describes how Jeroboam II. recovered the old territory of Israel, as far as the Dead Sea) do not, however, prove that Moab was included in Jeroboam’s conquests: and Mesha, at the time when Moab was dependent upon Israel, is still spoken of as ‘king’ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/3-4.htm" title="And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.">2 Kings 3:4</a>). More probably <span class="ital">judge</span>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm" title="Now gather yourself in troops, O daughter of troops: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel with a rod on the cheek.">Micah 5:1</a>, is a designation of the king,—derived from the fact that the administration of justice among his subjects was one of the primary duties of an Oriental monarch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-15.htm" title="And David reigned over all Israel; and David executed judgment and justice to all his people.">2 Samuel 8:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-2.htm" title="And Absalom rose up early, and stood beside the way of the gate: and it was so, that when any man that had a controversy came to the king for judgment, then Absalom called to him, and said, Of what city are you? And he said, Your servant is of one of the tribes of Israel.">2 Samuel 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-7.htm" title="Then he made a porch for the throne where he might judge, even the porch of judgment: and it was covered with cedar from one side of the floor to the other.">1 Kings 7:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/21-12.htm" title="O house of David, thus said the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings.">Jeremiah 21:12</a>, &c.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Both Ammon and Moab are frequently mentioned in the Inscriptions that have been already referred to as paying tribute to the Assyrians,—Sanib of Ammon, and Salman of Moab, for instance, to Tiglath-pileser; Puduil of Ammon, and Kamoshnadab of Moab, to Sennacherib; and Mussuri, king of Moab, to Esarhaddon (<span class="ital">K.A.T</span>[143][144], pp. 258, 291, 356). Isaiah, in a striking prophecy, foretells invasion and disaster for Moab (Isaiah 15-16): Jeremiah, a century later, does the same, in a prophecy containing many reminiscences of the oracle of his great predecessor (ch. 48): he also prophesies against Ammon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/49-1.htm" title="Concerning the Ammonites, thus said the LORD; Has Israel no sons? has he no heir? why then does their king inherit Gad, and his people dwell in his cities?...">Jeremiah 49:1-6</a>).

There is no ground for deducing, as Hitzig and Ewald do, from the use of this form that Moab had no king at this time. The country was conquered by the Chaldeans, and thenceforward sank into insignificance (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48.htm">Jeremiah 48</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-8.htm">Ezekiel 25:8-11</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>With the carrying away of the golden calf the kingdom of Samaria also perishes, and desert plants will grow upon the places of idols. <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-7.htm">Hosea 10:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-8.htm">Hosea 10:8</a>. "Destroyed is Samaria; her king like a splinter on the surface of the water. And destroyed are the high places of Aven, the sin of Israel: thorn and thistle will rise up on their altars; and they will speak to the mountains, Cover us! and to the hills, Fall on us!" &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; is not an asyndeton, "Samaria and its king;" but Sho&#772;mero&#772;n is to be taken absolutely, "as for Samaria," although, as a matter of fact, not only Samaria, the capital of the kingdom, but the kingdom itself, was destroyed. For malka&#770;h does not refer to any particular king, but is used in a general sense for "the king that Samaria had," so that the destruction of the monarchy is here predicted (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-15.htm">Hosea 10:15</a>). The idea that the words refer to one particular king, is not only at variance with the context, which contains no allusion to any one historical occurrence, but does not suit the simile: like a splinter upon the surface of the water, which is carried away by the current, and vanishes without leaving a trace behind. Qetseph is not "foam" (Chald., Symm., Rabb.), but a broken branch, a fagot or a splinter, as qetsa&#770;pha&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a> clearly shows. Ba&#770;mo&#772;th 'a&#770;ven are the buildings connected with the image-worship at Bethel ('a&#770;ven  equals  Be&#772;th-'e&#772;l, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>), the temple erected there (be&#772;th ba&#770;mo&#772;th), together with the altar, possibly also including other illegal places of sacrifice there, which constituted the chief sin of the kingdom of Israel. These were to be so utterly destroyed, that thorns and thistles would grow upon the ruined altars (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-18.htm">Genesis 3:18</a>). "The sign of extreme solitude, that there are not even the walls left, or any traces of the buildings" (Jerome). When the kingdom shall be thus broken up, together with the monarchy and the sacred places, the inhabitants, in their hopeless despair, will long for swift death and destruction. Saying to the mountains, "Cover us," etc., implies much more than hiding themselves in the holes and clefts of the rocks (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-19.htm">Isaiah 2:19</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-21.htm">Isaiah 2:21</a>). It expresses the desire to be buried under the falling mountains and hills, that they may no longer have to bear the pains and terrors of the judgment. In this sense are the words transferred by Christ, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-30.htm">Luke 23:30</a>, to the calamities attending the destruction of Jerusalem, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-16.htm">Revelation 6:16</a> to the terrors of the last judgment. </body></html>
