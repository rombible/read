The prophets of Israel were numerous, and renowned, and exposed to frequent persecution, <span class= "ital">e.g.,</span> the cases of Micaiah, Elijah, and others. “The Nazarite vow to abstain from wine, which, in the earliest case, that of Samson, appears a life-long vow, was undoubtedly a religious protest against Canaanite civilisation in favour of the simple life of ancient times.” (W. R. Smith, <span class= "ital">Prophets of Israel,</span> p. 84.) The Nazarite was, moreover, a link between the prophet and the priest, upon whom, without hereditary rank or sacerdotal rite, great privileges were bestowed. The assault upon both is highly characteristic of the disloyalty of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/2-11.htm" title="And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazarites.

They had helps for their souls, which taught them how to make good use of their earthly enjoyments, and were therefore more valuable. Faithful ministers are great blessings to any people; but it is God that raises them up to be so. Sinners' own consciences will witness that he has not been wanting to them in the means of grace. They did what they could to lead believers aside. Satan and his agents are busy to corrupt the minds of young people who look heavenward; they overcome many by drawing them to the love of mirth and pleasure, and into drinking company. Multitudes of young men who bade fair as professors of religion, have erred through strong drink, and have been undone for ever. The Lord complains of sin, especially the sins of his professing people, as a burden to him. And though his long-suffering be tired, his power is not, and so the sinner will find to his cost. When men reject God's word, adding obstinacy to sin, and this becomes the general character of a people, they will be given up to misery, notwithstanding all their boasted power and resources. May we then humble ourselves before the Lord, for all our ingratitude and unfaithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I raised up of your sons for prophets - Amos turns from outward mercies to inward, front past to present, from miracles of power to miracles of grace. God's past mercies live on in those of today; the mercies of today are the assurance to us that we have a share in the past; His miracles of grace are a token that the miracles of His power are not our condemnation. God had, from the time of Moses, "raised up" prophets. Eldad and Medad <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/11-26.htm">Numbers 11:26-29</a> were images Of those, whom God would raise up beyond the bounds of His promise. Samuel was an Ephrathite <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-1.htm">1 Samuel 1:1</a>; Ahijah the Shilonite, that is, of Shiloh in Ephraim, lived on to old age in the kingdom of the ten tribes after their schism, the witness against the apostasy of Jeroboam <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-7.htm">1 Kings 14:7-14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/15-29.htm">1 Kings 15:29</a>, yet acknowledged by the king whose rise and of the destruction of whose house he prophesied <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-4.htm">1 Kings 14:4</a>.<p>Jehu, son of Hanani, was the prophet of both kingdoms <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-1.htm">1 Kings 16:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-7.htm">1 Kings 16:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-12.htm">1 Kings 16:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/19-2.htm">2 Chronicles 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-34.htm">2 Chronicles 20:34</a>; Micaiah, son of Imlah, was well known to Ahab, as "prophesying evil concerning him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-8.htm">1 Kings 22:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-18.htm">1 Kings 22:18</a> continually; unknown to Jehoshaphat <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-7.htm">1 Kings 22:7</a>. That wondrous pair, marvelous for superhuman sanctity and power among the marvelous miracles of God, Elijalh and Elisha, were both "sons" of Israel, whom God "raised up; Elijjah the Tishbite" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>, born doubtless at Thisbe, a village of Naphthali , and one of the sojourners in Gilead; Elisha of Abelmeholah <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-16.htm">1 Kings 19:16</a>, on the west side of the valley of the Jordan . And even now He had raised up to them of their own "sons," Hosea and Jonah. Their presence was the presence of God among them, who, out of the ordinary way of His Providence, "raised" them "up" and filled them with His Spirit; and where the presence of God is, if there is fear, yet there is also hope.<p>And of your young men for Nazarites - The Nazarite was a fruit of the grace of God in its moral and religions workings, superhuman in holiness and self-denial, as the prophets were of that same grace, conferring superhuman wisdom and knowledge also. Of both, God says, "I raised up," teaching that both alike, holiness of life and superhman wisdom, were His own special gift to each individual, His own creation. God survived His people, called, and "raised up," by His grace, out of the crowd, those souls which responded to His call. The life of the Nazarites was a continual protest against the self-indulgence and worldliness of the people. It was a life above nature. Unless any prophet like Samuel <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm">1 Samuel 1:11</a>, was also a Nazarite, they had no special office except to live that life. Their life taught. Nay, it taught in one way the more, because they had no special gifts of wisdom or knowledge, nothing to distinguish them from ordinary people, except extraordinary grace.<p>They were an evidence, what all might do and be, if they used the grace of God. The power of the grace of God shows itself the more wondrously in these who have nought beside. The essence of the Nazarite life, as expressed by its name, was "separation," separation from things of the world, with a view to God. The separation was not, necessarily, for more than a limited time. In such case, it answered to the strictness of the Christian Lent. It was a considerable discipline for a time. In those simpler days, when luxury had not been so busy , the absolute prohibition of anything fermented <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3-4</a>, whether from the grape or any other substance  or vinegar made of either, or any liquor or refreshing food or drink, made in any way from the grape, fresh or dry, its husks or its kernels, while it cut off every evasion, involved the giving up not only every drink, in any way exciting or stimulating, but very much also, which was refreshing. Water, which in the east has seldom the freshness of ours, was their only drink. This, which to individuals may be an easy rule, would not be so in the main.<p>Those only think an undeviating rule slight, who have never tried one, nor set themselves on system to conquer self-will. Such a rule would not be acted upon, except for God. The long never-shorn hair was probably intended to involve the neglect of personal appearance. Yet this was the body only of the vow; its soul was the dedication to God. The Nazarite not only "separated himself from" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-3.htm">Numbers 6:3</a> those earthly things; he "separated himself to" the Lord <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-5.htm">Numbers 6:5-6</a> : he "consecrated to the Lord the days of his separation <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-12.htm">Numbers 6:12</a> : all the days of his separation he was holy to the Lord <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-8.htm">Numbers 6:8</a> : the separation of his God was upon his head." <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a>. The vow was a great and singular thing. "When man or woman shall vow a special vow of a Nazarite" <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-2.htm">Numbers 6:2</a>. The ritual of the Nazarite likened him to the priest. Giving him no priestly office, it yet even intensified some of the rules of the priesthood.<p>The priest was to abstain from wine and strong drink, only "when" he "went into the tabernacle of the congregations," that he might "put difference between holy and unholy, and teach Israel the statutes" of the Lord <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/10-9.htm">Leviticus 10:9-11</a> : the Nazarite, so long as he remained such. The priest might defile himself for certain very near dead <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-1.htm">Leviticus 21:1-3</a>; the high priest alone and the Nazarite, "neither for father nor mother" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/21-11.htm">Leviticus 21:11-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm">Numbers 6:7</a> : and that for the kindred reason; the high priest, "because the crown of the anointing oil of his God" was "upon him;" the Nazarite, "because the consecration of his God was upon his head!" His consecrated hair was called by the self-same name <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-19.htm">Numbers 6:19</a> as the mitre of the priest. It appears to have been woven into "seven locks" <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/16-13.htm">Judges 16:13</a>, itself a number of consecration. If his consecration came to an end, that hair was mingled with the sacrifice <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/6-18.htm">Numbers 6:18</a>, and on "his" hands alone, besides the priest's at his consecration, was part of the offering laid <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-19.htm">Numbers 6:19</a>.<p>All Israel was, in God's purpose, "a kingdom of priests" <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-6.htm">Exodus 19:6</a>; and, among them, the Nazarite was brought yet nearer, not to the priest's office, but to his character. This must have diffused itself indefinitely through the outward and inward life. Further strictness probably lay in the spirit of the vow. The outward appearance of the Nazarites appears to have been changed by their abstemiousness. "Her Nazarites were purer than snow; they were whiter than milk" <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-7.htm">Lamentations 4:7</a>. Their countenance had that transparent  purity, which sometimes results from a pure abstemious life; as Athanasius is said to have been "bloodless." John the Immerser, the counterpart of Elijah, ate only of the food of the wilderness, "locusts and wild honey;" his clothing was the hair cloth <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-15.htm">Luke 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-33.htm">Luke 7:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>.<p>Of James the Just it is related with reference to the Nazarite vow ; "He was holy from his mother's womb; wine and strong drink he drank not, nor ate any living thing; the razor came not up upon his head; he anointed him not with oil, and he used not a bath." Nazarites there had been in the most disorganized times of Israel. The histories of Samson and Samuel stand over against one another, as Nazarites who, the one forfeited, the other persevered in, his vocation. Elijah's ascetic character is as if he had been one of them, or deepened the lines of their rule. Ahaziah's ungodly messengers described him contemptously as "a man, lord of hair," as though he had nothing but his prophet's broad mantle of hair, and "the leather girdle about his loins" .<p>The Rechabites, although Kenites by origin <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/2-55.htm">1 Chronicles 2:55</a>, had been enrolled in the people of God, and had received a rule from their father, uniting with the abstinence of the Nazarites, a mode of life which kept them aloof from the corruptions of cities <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-7.htm">Jeremiah 35:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-9.htm">Jeremiah 35:9</a>. The rules of their Nomadic life were consecrated to God, for He says, "There shall not be cut off from Jonadub, the son of Rechab, a man standing before Me for ever" <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-19.htm">Jeremiah 35:19</a>, that is, as the servant of God. God uses as to them the term which marks the service of the Levites <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-8.htm">Deuteronomy 10:8</a>, priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/20-28.htm">Judges 20:28</a>, and prophets <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/17-1.htm">1 Kings 17:1</a>. Jonadab, the author of their rule, was plainly an ascetic, through whose presence Jehu hoped to cast a religious character over his ambitious execution of God's command .<p>But the value which the artful, though impetuous <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-20.htm">2 Kings 9:20</a>, bloodstained, captain attached to the presence of the ascetic shows the weight which they had with the people. Strange sight it must have been, the energetic warrior in his coat of mail, and the ascetic, as energetic, in his hair-cloth. Deeper far the cotrast within. But the more marvelous the contrast, the more it attests the influence which the unworldly ascetic had over the world. Like the garb of the prophets, their appearance was a standing rebuke to a life of sense. Like the patriarchs, it professed that they were "strangers and pilgrims upon the earth." They who sought nothing of the world or of time, were a witness to the belief in their eternal home. The Nazarites must now have been a numerous body, since Amos speaks of them, as a known class, like the prophets, of whose numbers we hear incidentally .<p>Yet the memory of these, who, amid the general corruption, were, each in his own sphere, centers of pure faith and life, is embalmed in these few words only. So little reason is there to think that God's commands were neglected by all, because their observance is not related. Amos appeals publicly to the people that the fact was so, that God had raised up Nazarites as well as prophets among them. He had His "little flock" <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/12-32.htm">Luke 12:32</a>, His "seven thousand" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>, who escaped the eye even of Elijah. The gift of the Nazarites was a special favor to Israel, as a memorial what the grace of God could do for man, what man could do, with the grace of God. His "raising up Nazarites, out of their young men," men in their first bloom of unmarried , virgin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-25.htm">Deuteronomy 32:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-22.htm">Jeremiah 51:22</a>; and in the plur. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-63.htm">Psalm 78:63</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/148-12.htm">Psalm 148:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/23-4.htm">Isaiah 23:4</a>;. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-13.htm">Jeremiah 31:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/1-18.htm">Lamentations 1:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/2-21.htm">Lamentations 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/9-17.htm">Zechariah 9:17</a>; and by Amos himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-13.htm">Amos 8:13</a>), life their picked "very chosen men," such as furnished the prime of their warriors , stengthened that teaching.<p>Even now, one devoted to God in his youth is a witness for God, leaven of the world around him. But the Nazarite had also to bear an outward mark for good, to be singular. His appearance bespoke that he had chosen God. His vow was not only a living up to the law; it lay beyond the law, the free-will offering of those whom God called. At an age, when so many do things unlawful, to gratitfy passion, these abstained even from things lawful. "Canst thou not do what these youths and these maidens can? or can they either in themselves, and not rather in the Lord their God?" was Augustine's upbraiding of himself , on the eve of his conversion, in thought of those who were living a devoted virgin life.<p>Is it not even thus? - It were enough that God, the Truth, said it. But He condemns not, without giving space for excuse or defense. So he describes the Day of Judgment <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-24.htm">Matthew 25:24-30</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/25-41.htm">Matthew 25:41-45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/22-11.htm">Matthew 22:11</a>. "The books were opened - and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works" <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-12.htm">Revelation 20:12</a>. Now, in the time of grace, the question asks, what, written under the picture of Christ crucified, once converted a sinner; "This have I done for thee: What doest thou for Me?" What did they? What had they done? What would they do? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Additional obligations under which Israel lay to God; the prophets and Nazarites, appointed by Him, to furnish religious instruction and examples of holy self-restraint.<p>of your young men&#8212;It was a specimen of Israel's highly favored state, that, of the class most addicted to pleasures, God chose those who by a solemn vow bound themselves to abstinence from all produce of the vine, and from all ceremonial and moral defilement. The Nazarite was not to shave (Nu 6:2, &c.). God left nothing undone to secure the purity of their worship and their faithfulness to it (La 4:7). The same comes from a Hebrew root, nazar, "to set apart." Samson, Samuel, and John the Baptist were Nazarites.<p>Is it not even thus&#8212;Will any of you dare to deny it is so?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">I raised up; </span> gave prophetic endowments, stirred up their minds, commissioned them to prophesy, and carried them through by an undaunted courage given to them, that they, should not fear to set upon, or faint in attending to, their office. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of your sons for prophets; </span> did not employ strangers, whose affections you might with some colour of reason suspect, but your own sons, whose affections to you and to their own country are unquestionable, were sent prophets to tell you of your sins, to foretell your dangers, and to importune you to repent of your sins, and to prevent your dangers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Your young men; </span> though that age be generally inclined to please their own fancies, to walk after the sight of their eyes, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-9.htm" title="Rejoice, O young man, in your youth; and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, and walk in the ways of your heart, and in the sight of your eyes: but know you, that for all these things God will bring you into judgment.">Ecclesiastes 11:9</a></span>, yet did God change the mind of some of them in their youth, and inclined them to eminency in religion, to be examples to others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nazarites; </span> which were religious persons under vow bound to a very sober, abstemious, and holy life; either for some certain limited time, or for their whole life: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,">Numbers 6:1</a>,2</span>, &c.

The Nazirites were men who, when the sensual and self-indulgent habits of the Canaanites threatened to make their way into Israel, endeavoured by a vow of abstinence to set an example of moderation and self-denial, which might help to preserve the old simplicity of Israelitish life. The chief obligations of the Nazirite were to abstain from all intoxicating drinks, to eat no “unclean” thing[145], and (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-6.htm" title="All the days that he separates himself to the LORD he shall come at no dead body.">Numbers 6:6</a> f.) to avoid the ceremonial “uncleanness” occasioned by contact with a corpse: as a sign of his “separation” (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-7.htm" title="He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die: because the consecration of his God is on his head.">Numbers 6:7</a> <span class="ital">end</span>), also, his hair was not shaved, but suffered to grow in its natural state[146]. The only certain historical example of a Nazirite, mentioned in the O.T., is Samson (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-5.htm" title="For, see, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and no razor shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.">Jdg 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm" title="But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.">Jdg 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-14.htm" title="She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.">Jdg 13:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/16-17.htm" title="That he told her all his heart, and said to her, There has not come a razor on my head; for I have been a Nazarite to God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man.">Jdg 16:17</a>). Samuel, however, is often considered to have been a Nazirite (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-11.htm" title="And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction of your handmaid, and remember me, and not forget your handmaid, but will give to your handmaid a man child, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and there shall no razor come on his head.">1 Samuel 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-28.htm" title="Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the LORD there.">1 Samuel 1:28</a>), though the term itself is not actually applied to him[147]. But from the present passage it may be inferred that they formed a numerous class. The law regulating the vow of the Nazirite is codified in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/6-1.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,...">Numbers 6:1-21</a> : but this, in its present form, springs probably from a later age than that of Amos, and represents the form which the regulations on the subject finally assumed. Samson was dedicated to the life of a Nazirite before his birth, and so also was Samuel (if he is rightly treated as a Nazirite): but this, no doubt, was exceptional; it is implied by Amos that “young men,” when they felt the inner call, spontaneously dedicated themselves to the ascetic life. The Rechabites (Jeremiah 35), whose founder was a contemporary of Jehu’s (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/10-15.htm" title="And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.">2 Kings 10:15</a> ff.), were a sect or guild, established with the same object of maintaining a simple habit of life, in contrast to the laxity and effeminacy too often prevalent in these cities. Amos regards the Nazirites as a living protest against the luxury and sensuality to which Israel was now too much addicted (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-1.htm" title="Hear this word, you cows of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.">Amos 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/6-3.htm" title="You that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;...">Amos 6:3-7</a>); and sees in their appearance, as in that of the prophets, a mark of God’s care for the higher welfare of His people. See further, on the Nazirites, Nowack, <span class="ital">Hebr. Archäologie</span>, II. pp. 133–138.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[145] At least this may be inferred from the condition imposed upon Samson’s mother (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-4.htm" title="Now therefore beware, I pray you, and drink not wine nor strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:">Jdg 13:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-7.htm" title="But he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive, and bear a son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from the womb to the day of his death.">Jdg 13:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-14.htm" title="She may not eat of any thing that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing: all that I commanded her let her observe.">Jdg 13:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[146] Cf. with this the rule by which the Arabs, while a sacred obligation rests upon them (as the duty of blood-revenge, or during a pilgrimage) never shave their hair (Wellhausen, <span class="ital">Reste Arab.

Their very name implied separation from the world and devotion to God. They were, in fact, the religious of the old Law, analogous to the monks of Christian times.

Taking the general import of the passage and the signification of the word "Nazarite," the LXX. renders, <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;</span>, "I took...  and of your young men for consecration." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The prophet goes back a third time (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-1.htm">Hosea 10:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-10.htm">Hosea 9:10</a>) to the early times of Israel, and shows how the people had repaid the Lord, for all the proofs of His love, with nothing but ingratitude and unfaithfulness; so that it would have merited utter destruction from off the earth, if God should not restrain His wrath for the sake of His unchangeable faithfulness, in order that, after severely chastening, He might gather together once more those that were rescued from among the heathen. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a>. "When Israel was young, then I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a>. Men called to them; so they went away from their countenance: they offer sacrifice to the Baals, and burn incense to the idols." <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-1.htm">Hosea 11:1</a> rests upon <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22-23</a>, where the Lord directs Moses to say to Pharaoh, "Israel is my first-born son; let my son go, that he may serve me." Israel was the son of Jehovah, by virtue of its election to be Jehovah's peculiar people (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-22.htm">Exodus 4:22</a>). In this election lay the ground for the love which God showed to Israel, by bringing it out of Egypt, to give it the land of Canaan, promised to the fathers for its inheritance. The adoption of Israel as the son of Jehovah, which began with its deliverance out of the bondage of Egypt, and was completed in the conclusion of the covenant at Sinai, forms the first stage in the carrying out of the divine work of salvation, which was completed in the incarnation of the Son of God for the redemption of mankind from death and ruin. The development and guidance of Israel as the people of God all pointed to Christ; not, however, in any such sense as that the nation of Israel was to bring forth the son of God from within itself, but in this sense, that the relation which the Lord of heaven and earth established and sustained with that nation, was a preparation for the union of God with humanity, and paved the way for the incarnation of His Son, by the fact that Israel was trained to be a vessel of divine grace. All essential factors in the history of Israel point to this as their end, and thereby become types and material prophecies of the life of Him in whom the reconciliation of man to God was to be realized, and the union of God with the human race to be developed into a personal unity. It is in this sense that the second half of our verse is quoted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/2-15.htm">Matthew 2:15</a> as a prophecy of Christ, not because the words of the prophet refer directly and immediately to Christ, but because the sojourn in Egypt, and return out of that land, had the same significance in relation to the development of the life of Jesus Christ, as it had to the nation of Israel. Just as Israel grew into a nation in Egypt, where it was out of the reach of Canaanitish ways, so was the child Jesus hidden in Egypt from the hostility of Herod. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-2.htm">Hosea 11:2</a> is attached thus as an antithesis: this love of its God was repaid by Israel with base apostasy. &#1511;&#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, they, viz., the prophets (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/11-7.htm">Hosea 11:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-13.htm">2 Kings 17:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-25.htm">Jeremiah 7:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-4.htm">Jeremiah 25:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/1-4.htm">Zechariah 1:4</a>), called to them, called the Israelites to the Lord and to obedience to Him; but they (the Israelites) went away from their countenance, would not hearken to the prophets, or come to the Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-31.htm">Jeremiah 2:31</a>). The thought is strengthened by &#1499;&#1468;&#1503;, with the &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; of the protasis omitted (Ewald, 360, a): as the prophets called, so the Israelites drew back from them, and served idols. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-15.htm">Hosea 2:15</a>, and &#1508;&#1468;&#1505;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-41.htm">2 Kings 17:41</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-5.htm">Deuteronomy 7:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/7-25.htm">Deuteronomy 7:25</a> (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). </body></html>
