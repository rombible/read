The sins and ingratitude of the people are aggravated by a recital of the Divine Mercy. By comparing this verse with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm" title="That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?">Amos 8:6</a>, it is clear that the Jewish interpreters (followed by Keil) were incorrect in charging this sin upon corrupt judges, who, by <span class= "ital">bribery,</span> would deliver unjust judgments against the righteous. The sin consists in the perverse straining of the law, which allowed an insolvent debtor to sell himself into bondage to redeem a debt (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm" title="Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.">2Kings 4:1</a>; also <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm" title="And if your brother that dwells by you be waxen poor, and be sold to you; you shall not compel him to serve as a bondservant:">Leviticus 25:39</a>). In this case the debtor was a righteous man in sore straits for no fault of his own.

The reason why that kingdom was particularly addressed seems to have been, that Pul invaded it in the reign of Uzziah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/15-19.htm" title="And Pul the king of Assyria came against the land: and Menahem gave Pul a thousand talents of silver, that his hand might be with him to confirm the kingdom in his hand.">2 Kings 15:19</a>; and that in less than half a century after the first Assyrian invasion, it was subverted by Shalmaneser, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-6.htm" title="In the ninth year of Hoshea the king of Assyria took Samaria, and carried Israel away into Assyria, and placed them in Halah and in Habor by the river of Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.">2 Kings 17:6</a>.” — Newcome. <span class="ital">Because they sold the righteous for silver, </span>&c. — They perverted the cause of the righteous; and gave forth unjust sentences against them for bribes of the smallest value, even for a pair of shoes or sandals. <span class="ital">That pant after the dust of the earth — </span>That is, silver and gold, white and yellow dust: they covet it earnestly, and levy it on the heads of the poor by their unjust exactions. The Vulgate, however, gives another sense to this sentence. <span class="ital">Qui conterunt super pulverem terræ capita pauperum: who tread down the heads of the poor into the dust of the earth: </span>that is, they throw them into the dust and then trample upon them. <span class="ital">And turn aside the way of the meek — </span>From right and justice. They contrived to do injuries to those who they knew were mild and patient, and would bear injuries; invading their rights, and obstructing the course of justice. Observe, reader, the more patiently men bear the injuries that are done them, the greater is the sin of those that injure them, and the more occasion they have to expect that God will do his people justice, and take vengeance for them. <span class="ital">And a man and his father will go in to the same maid — </span>Or, young woman; <span class="ital">to profane my holy name </span>— To the great reproach of my name and religion: being such an instance of fornication as is scarce heard of among the more civilized heathen, as St. Paul observes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-1.htm" title="It is reported commonly that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father's wife.">1 Corinthians 5:1</a>.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:1-8 The evil passions of the heart break out in various forms; but the Lord looks to our motives, as well as our conduct. Those that deal cruelly, shall be cruelly dealt with. Other nations were reckoned with for injuries done to men; Judah is reckoned with for dishonour done to God. Judah despised the law of the Lord; and he justly gave them up to strong delusion; nor was it any excuse for their sin, that they were the lies, the idols, after which their fathers walked. The worst abominations and most grievous oppressions have been committed by some of the professed worshippers of the Lord. Such conduct leads many to unbelief and vile idolatry.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For three transgressions of Israel, and for four - In Israel, on whom the divine sentence henceforth rests, the prophet numbers four classes of sins, running into one another, as all sins do, since all grievous sins contain many in one, yet in some degree distinct:<p>(1) Perversion of justice;<p>(2) oppression of the poor;<p>(3) uncleanness;<p>(4) luxury with idolatry.<p>They sold the righteous for silver - It is clear from the opposite statement, "that we may buy the poor for silver and the needy for a pair of shoes," that the prophet is not speaking of judicial iniquity, but of actual buying and selling. The law allowed a Hebrew who was poor to sell himself , and a Hebrew to buy him until the year of release; yet this too with the express reserve, that the purchaser was forbidden to "serve himself with him with the service of a slave, but as a hired servant and a sojourner stroll he be with thee" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-39.htm">Leviticus 25:39-40</a>. The thief who could not repay what he stole, was to "be sold for his theft" <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/22-2.htm">Exodus 22:2-3</a>. But the law gave no power to sell an insolvent debtor. It grew up in practice. The sons and daughters of the debtor <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/5-5.htm">Nehemiah 5:5</a>, or "his wife and children" <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/18-25.htm">Matthew 18:25</a>, nay even the sons of a deceased debtor <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-1.htm">2 Kings 4:1</a>, were sold. Nehemiah rebuked this sharply. In that case, the hardness was aggravated by the fact that the distress had been fomented by usury. But the aggravation did not constitute the sin. It seems to be this merciless selling by the creditor, with Amos rebukes. The "righteous" is probably one who, without any blame, became insolvent. The "pair of shoes," that is, sandals, express the trivial price, or the luxury for which he was sold. They had him sold "for the sake of a pair of sandals," that is, in order to procure them. Trivial in themselves, as being a mere sole, the sandals of the Hebrew women were, at times, costly and beautiful (Sol 7:1; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/10.htm">Ezra 10</a>; Judith 16:9). Such a sale expressed contempt for man, made in the image of God, that he was sold either for some worthless price, or for some needless adornment. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Compare the same phrase, for "the most paltry bribe," Am 8:6; Eze 13:19; Joe 3:3. They were not driven by poverty to such a sin; beginning with suffering themselves to be tempted by a large bribe, they at last are so reckless of all shame as to prostitute justice for the merest trifle. Amos convicts them of injustice, incestuous unchastity, and oppression first, as these were so notorious that they could not deny them, before he proceeds to reprove their contempt of God, which they would have denied on the ground that they worshipped God in the form of the calves.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="ital">For three transgressions</span>: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Israel; </span> the kingdom of the ten tribes, under the government of Jeroboam the Second at this time, against which the prophet was chiefly sent, though he began with Syria and others, by the threats against which nations he prepared both Judah and Israel to hearken and consider. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will not turn away the punishment:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-3.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:">Amos 1:3</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They; </span> those who by the appointment of the law had power to hear and decide causes between man and man; judges and witnesses, like the corrupt judges, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">sold, </span> for bribes were their aim, and they would at any time sell justice to the highest bidder. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The righteous; </span> the innocent, or those who had a just and righteous cause, for the prophet here speaks of the justness of the cause, not of the exact justice or absolute righteousness of the person. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For silver:</span> money was the most current and prevailing commodity with these judges, but money’s worth would do the feat too, if money were out of the way. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The poor:</span> when poor men went to law with poor men before these judges, and the thing they contended for was of small value, the contenders too had light purses, and could not give a considerable bribe; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">a pair of shoes, </span> a very poor bribe, expressed here proverbially, would sway with these judges, who gaped still after somewhat of gain from all. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/amos/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord, for three transgressions of Israel,....

But the form of expression is opposed to this interpretation. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/10.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>In the next verse the punishment is still further defined, and also extended to Judah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-11.htm">Hosea 10:11</a>. "And Ephraim is an instructed cow, which loves to thresh; and I, I have come over the beauty of her neck: I yoke Ephraim; Judah will plough, Jacob harrow itself." Melumma&#770;da&#770;h, instructed, trained to work, received its more precise definition from the words "loving to thresh" ('o&#772;habht&#305;&#772;, a participle with the connecting Yod in the constructive: see Ewald, 211, b), not as being easier work in comparison with the hard task of driving, ploughing, and harrowing, but because in threshing the ox was allowed to eat at pleasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm">Deuteronomy 25:4</a>), from which Israel became fat and strong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>). Threshing, therefore, is a figurative representation not of the conquest of other nations (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-13.htm">Micah 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-15.htm">Isaiah 41:15</a>), but of pleasant, productive, profitable labour. Israel had accustomed itself to this, from the fact that God had bestowed His blessing upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-6.htm">Hosea 13:6</a>). But it would be different now. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1500;, a prophetic perfect: I come over the neck, used in a hostile sense, and answering to our "rushing in upon a person." The actual idea is that of putting a heavy yoke upon the neck, not of putting a rider upon it. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1489; not to mount or ride, but to drive, or use for drawing and driving, i.e., to harness, and that, as the following clauses show, to the plough and harrow, for the performance of hard field-labour, which figuratively represents subjugation and bondage. Judah is also mentioned here again, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-14.htm">Hosea 8:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/6-11.htm">Hosea 6:11</a>, etc. Jacob, in connection with Judah, is not a name for the whole nation (or the twelve tribes), but is synonymous with Ephraim, i.e., Israel of the ten tribes. This is required by the correspondence between the last two clauses, which are simply a further development of the expression &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1489; &#1488;&#1507;, with an extension of the punishment threatened against Ephraim to Judah also. </body></html>
