Those who make gain their godliness, and are governed by the hopes of wealth and preferment, are ready to think these the most powerful motives with others also. But those who have a warrant from God, like Amos, ought not to fear the face of man. If God, that sent him, had not strengthened him, he could not thus have set his face as a flint. The Lord often chooses the weak and foolish things of the world to confound the wise and mighty. But no fervent prayers, or self-denying labours, can bring proud sinners to bear faithful reproofs and warnings. And all who oppose or despise the Divine word, must expect fatal effects to their souls, unless they repent.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Amaziah then was in direct rebellion and contradiction against God. He was in an office forbidden by God. God's word came to him. He had his choice; and, as people do, when entangled in evil courses, he chose the more consciously amiss. He had to resign his lucrative office and to submit to God speaking to him through a shepherd, or to stand in direct opposition to God, and to confront God; and in silencing Amos, he would silence God. But, like one who would arrest the lightning, he draws it on his own head. Amos contrasts the word of Amaziah, and the word of God; Rup.: "Hear thou the word of the Lord; Thou sayest; prophesy not against Israel. Therefore thus saith the Lord." Not only will I not cease to prophesy against Israel, but I will also prophesy to thee. Hear now thine own part of the prophecy."<p>Drop not - The form of expression, (not the word) is probably taken from Moses. "My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew; as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-2.htm">Deuteronomy 32:2</a>. Micah speaks of the word as used by those who forbade to prophesy, as though the prophecy were a continual wearisome "dropping." God's word comes as a gentle dew or soft rain, not beating down but refreshing; not sweeping away, like a storm, but sinking in and softening even hard ground, all but the rock; gentle, so as they can bear it. God's word was to people, such as they were toward it; dropping like the dew on those who received it; wearing, to those who hardened themselves against it. It drops in measure upon the hearts which it fertilizes, being adapted to their capacity to receive it. And so contrariwise as to the judgments with which God's prophets are charged. : "The prophets do not discharge at once the whole wrath of God, but, in their threatenings, denounce little drops of it." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. drop&#8212;distil as the refreshing drops of rain (De 32:2; Eze 21:2; compare Mic 2:6, 11).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Now; </span> when forbidden, Amos, undaunted, prophesieth to him that forbade him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hear thou, </span> Amaziah, who hast accused, yet pretendest to wish and advise my safety, the word of the Lord, who sent me, whom thou contradictest; from him I have somewhat to say to thee, and of much concern also to thee. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Thou sayest, </span> usest thy power to silence me, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Prophesy not against Israel; </span> preach not sedition, or what tends to it, under pretence that God speaks it against Israel: if thou canst speak good of us, and to us, this may be good for thee; but if thou wilt speak sad news against us, it will not be believed; it may hurt thee, it will do no good to others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Drop not; </span> distil not: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem, and drop your word toward the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel,">Ezekiel 21:2</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-6.htm" title="Prophesy you not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.">Micah 2:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the house of Isaac; </span> the posterity of Isaac: this explains the former, and is a hendiadis, or elegant ingemination. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/amos/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now therefore hear thou the word of the Lord,....

"Behold, I send you the corn, and the new wine, and the oil, that ye may become satisfied therewith; and will no more make you a reproach among the nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-20.htm">Joel 2:20</a>. And I will remove the northern one far away from you, and drive him into the land of drought and desert; its van into the front sea, and its rear into the hinder sea: and its stink will ascend, and its corruption ascend, for it has done great things." The Lord promises, first of all, a compensation for the injury done by the devastation, and then the destruction of the devastation itself, so that it may do no further damage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-19.htm">Joel 2:19</a> stands related to <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>. Sha&#770;lach, to send: the corn is said to be sent instead of given (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-10.htm">Hosea 2:10</a>), because God sends the rain which causes the corn to grow. Israel shall no longer be a reproach among the nations, "as a poor people, whose God is unable to assist it, or has evidently forsaken it" (Ros.). Marck and Schmieder have already observed that this promise is related to the prayer, that He would not give up His inheritance to the reproach of the scoffings of the heathen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a> : see the comm. on this verse). &#1492;&#1510;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;, the northern one, as an epithet applied to the swarm of locusts, furnishes no decisive argument in favour of the allegorical interpretation of the plague of locusts. For even if locusts generally come to Palestine from the south, out of the Arabian desert, the remark out of the Arabian desert, the remark made by Jerome, to the effect that "the swarms of locusts are more generally brought by the south wind than by the north," shows that the rule is not without its exceptions. "Locusts come and go with all winds" (Oedmann, ii. p. 97). In Arabia, Niebuhr (Beschreib. p. 169) saw swarms of locusts come from south, west, north, and east. Their home is not confined to the desert of Arabia, but they are found in all the sandy deserts, which form the southern boundaries of the lands that were, and to some extent still are, the seat of cultivation, viz., in the Sahara, the Libyan desert, Arabia, and Irak (Credner, p. 285); and Niebuhr (l.c.) saw a large tract of land, on the road from Mosul to Nisibis, completely covered with young locusts. They are also met with in the Syrian desert, from which swarms could easily be driven to Palestine by a north-east wind, without having to fly across the mountains of Lebanon. Such a swarm as this might be called the tsepho&#772;n&#305;&#772;, i.e., the northern one, or northerner, even if the north was not its true home. For it cannot be philologically proved that tsepho&#772;n&#305;&#772; can only denote one whose home is in the north. Such explanations as the Typhonian, the barbarian, and others, which we meet with in Hitzig, Ewald, and Meier, and which are obtained by alterations of the text or far-fetched etymologies, must be rejected as arbitrary. That which came from the north shall also be driven away by the north wind, viz., the great mass into the dry and desert land, i.e., the desert of Arabia, the van into the front (or eastern) sea, i.e., the Dead Sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-18.htm">Ezekiel 47:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-8.htm">Zechariah 14:8</a>), the rear into the hinder (or western) sea, i.e., the Mediterranean (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-24.htm">Deuteronomy 11:24</a>). This is, of course, not to be understood as signifying that the dispersion was to take place in all these three directions at one and the same moment, in which case three different winds would blow at the same time; but it is a rhetorical picture of rapid and total destruction, which is founded upon the idea that the wind rises in the north-west, then turns to the north, and finally to the north-east, so that the van of the swarm is driven into the eastern sea, the great mass into the southern desert, and the rear into the western sea. The explanation given by Hitzig and others - namely, that pa&#770;n&#305;&#772;m signifies the eastern border, and so&#772;ph the western border of the swarm, which covered the entire breadth of the land, and was driven from north to south - cannot be sustained. Joel mentions both the van and the rear after the main body, simply because they both meet with the same fate, both falling into the sea and perishing there; whereupon the dead bodies are thrown up by the waves upon the shore, where their putrefaction fills the air with stench. The perishing of locusts in seas and lakes is attested by many authorities.<p>(Note: Even Pliny says (h. n. xi. 29), Gregatim sublato vento in maria aut stagna decidunt; and Jerome has the following remarks on this verse: "Even in our own times we have seen the land of Judaea covered by swarms of locusts, which, as soon as the wind rose, were precipitated into the first and latest seas, i.e., the Dead Sea and the Mediterranean. And when the shores of both seas were filled with heaps of dead locusts, which the waters had thrown up, their corruption and stench became so noxious, that even the atmosphere was corrupted, and both man and beasts suffered from the consequent pestilence.")<p>For &#1506;&#1500;&#1492; &#1489;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-3.htm">Isaiah 34:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-10.htm">Amos 4:10</a>. &#1510;&#1495;&#1504;&#1492; is &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.; but the meaning corruption is sustained partly by the parallelism, and partly by the Syriac verb, which means to be dirty. The army of locusts had deserved this destruction, because it had done great things. &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514;, to do great things, is affirmed of men or other creatures, with the subordinate idea of haughtiness; so that it not only means he has done a mighty thing, accomplished a mighty devastation, but is used in the same sense as the German grosstun, via. to brag or be proud of one strength. It does not follow from this, however, that the locusts are simply figurative, and represent hostile nations. For however true it may be that sin and punishment presuppose accountability (Hengst., Hvernick), and conclusion drawn from this - namely, that they cannot be imputed to irrational creatures - is incorrect. The very opposite is taught by the Mosaic law, according to which God will punish every act of violence done by beasts upon man (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-5.htm">Genesis 9:5</a>), whilst the ox which killed a man was commanded to be stoned (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-28.htm">Exodus 21:28-32</a>). </body></html>
