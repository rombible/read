Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I, I too have withholden the rain - Jerome, dwelling in Palestine, says, that "this rain, when "three months yet remained until harvest," was the "latter rain," of the very greatest necessity for the fields of Palestine and the thirsty ground, lest, when the blade is swelling into the crop, and gendering the wheat, it should dry up through lack of moisture. The time intended is the spring, at the end of April, whence, to the wheat-harvest, there remain three months, May, June, July." "God withheld the rain that they might endure, not only lack of bread, but burning thirst and penury of drink also. For in these places, where we now live, all the water, except small fountains, is of cisterns; and if the wrath of God should withhold the rain, there is greater peril of thirst than of hunger, such its Scripture relates to have endured for three years and six months in the days of the prophet Elijah. And lest they should think that this had befallen their cities and people, by a law of nature, or the influence of the stars, or the variety of the seasons, He says, that He rained upon one city and its fields, and from another withheld the rain."<p>This was a second visitation of God. First, a general famine, "in all their cities;" secondly, a discriminating visitation. "Nature" possesses no discrimination or power over her supplies. Seeming waste is one of the mysteries of God in nature, "to cause it to rain on the earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-26.htm">Job 38:26</a> where "no man" is; on "the wilderness wherein" there, "is no man." Ordinarily too, God "maketh His sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-45.htm">Matthew 5:45</a>. But God does not enslave Himself, (as people would have it) to His own laws. Amos appeals to them, that God had dealt with them, not according to His ordinary laws; that not only God had given to one city the rain which he had withheld from another, but that He had made the same difference as to smaller "pieces" of ground, the inherited "portions" of individuals . Some such variations have been observed in Palestine now.  But this would have been no indication of God's Providence, had not the consciences of people responded to the prophet's appeal, and recognized that the rain had been given or withheld according to the penitence or impenitence, the deeper or more mitigated idolatry, the greater or less sinfulness of the people. We have. then, in these few words a law of God's dealing with Israel. God, in His word, reveals to us the meaning of His daily variations in the workings of nature; yet, hardly even in such instances, as people can scarcely elude, do they think of God the Creator, rather than of nature, His creation. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. withholden &#8230; rain &#8230; three months to &#8230; harvest&#8212;the time when rain was most needed, and when usually "the latter rain" fell, namely, in spring, the latter half of February, and the whole of March and April (Ho 6:3; Joe 2:23).

"When Ephraim spake, there was terror; he exalted himself in Israel; then he offended through Baal, and died. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. And now they continue to sin, and make themselves molten images out of their silver, idols according to their understanding: manufacture of artists is it all: they say of them, Sacrificers of men: let them kiss calves." In order to show how deeply Israel had fallen through its apostasy, the prophet points to the great distinction which the tribe of Ephraim formerly enjoyed among the tribes of Israel. The two clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a> cannot be so connected together as that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; should be taken as a continuation of the infinitive &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. The emphatic &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is irreconcilable with this. We must rather take &#1512;&#1514;&#1514; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., in Aramaean  equals  &#1512;&#1496;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, terror, tremor) as the apodosis to kedabbe&#772;r 'Ephraim (when Ephraim spake), like &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a> : "As Ephraim spake there was terror," i.e., men listened with fear and trembling (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-21.htm">Job 29:21</a>). &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is used intransitively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>. Ephraim, i.e., the tribe of Ephraim, "exalted itself in Israel," - not "it was distinguished among its brethren" (Hitzig), but "it raised itself to the government." The prophet has in his mind the attempts made by Ephraim to get the rule among the tribes, which led eventually to the secession of the ten tribes from the royal family of David, and the establishment of the kingdom of Israel by the side of that of Judah. When Ephraim had secured this, the object of its earnest endeavours, it offended through Baal; i.e., not only through the introduction of the worship of Baal in the time of Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>.), but even through the establishment of the worship of the calves under Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>), through which Jehovah was turned into a Baal. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, used of the state or kingdom, is equivalent to "was given up to destruction" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>). The dying commenced with the introduction of the unlawful worship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-30.htm">1 Kings 12:30</a>). From this sin Ephraim (the people of the ten tribes) did not desist: they still continue to sin, and make themselves molten images, etc., contrary to the express prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). These words are not merely to be understood as signifying, that they added other idolatrous images in Gilgal and Beersheba to the golden calves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>); but they also involve their obstinate adherence to the idolatrous worship introduced by Jeroboam (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; from &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, with the feminine termination dropped on account of the suffix (according to Ewald, 257, d; although in the note Ewald regards this formation as questionable, and doubts the correctness of the reading): "according to their understanding," i.e., their proficiency in art.<p>The meaning of the second hemistich, which is very difficult, depends chiefly upon the view we take of &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, viz., whether we render these words "they who sacrifice men," as the lxx, the fathers, and many of the rabbins and Christian expositors have done; or "the sacrificers of (among) men," as Kimchi, Bochart, Ewald, and others do, after the analogy of &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>. Apart from this, however, zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m cannot possibly be taken as an independent sentence, such as "they sacrifice men," or "human sacrificers are they," unless with the lxx we change the participle &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497; arbitrarily into the perfect &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;. As the words read, they must be connected with what follows or with what precedes. But if we connect them with what follows, we fail to obtain any suitable thought, whether we render it "human sacrificers (those who sacrifice men) kiss calves," or "the sacrificers among men kiss calves." The former is open to the objection that human sacrifices were not offered to the calves (i.e., to Jehovah, as worshipped under the symbol of a calf), but only to Moloch, and that the worshippers of Moloch did not kiss calves. The latter, "men who offer sacrifice kiss calves," might indeed be understood in this sense, that the prophet intended thereby to denounce the great folly, that men should worship animals; but this does not suit the preceding words &#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, and it is impossible to see in what sense they could be employed. There is no other course left, therefore, than to connect Zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m with what precedes, though not in the way proposed by Ewald, viz., "even to these do sacrificers of men say." This rendering is open to the following objections: (1) that &#1492;&#1501; after &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; would have to be taken as an emphatic repetition of the pronoun, and we cannot find any satisfactory ground for this; and, (2) what is still more important, the fact that 'a&#770;ma&#770;r would be used absolutely, in the sense of "they speak in prayer," which, even apart from the "prayer," cannot be sustained by any other analogous example. These difficulties vanish if we take Zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m as an explanatory apposition to he&#772;m: "of them (the &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m) they say, viz., the sacrificers from among men (i.e., men who sacrifice), Let them worship calves." By the apposition zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m, and the fact that the object &#8219;a&#774;ga&#770;l&#305;&#772;m is placed first, so that it stands in immediate contrast to 'a&#770;da&#770;m, the absurdity of men kissing calves, i.e., worshipping them with kisses (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>), is painted as it were before the eye. </body></html>
