Notwithstanding their chastisement, God says, “Ye have not returned even up to me.” Jehovah is here introduced as grieving over the failure of his disciplinary treatment of Israel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/4-6.htm" title="And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD....">Amos 4:6-8</a></span>. <span class="ital">And I also have given you — </span>Or, for this cause I have given you, <span class="ital">cleanness of teeth — </span>An expression signifying a scarcity of food, or a famine. The famine which we read of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.">2 Kings 8:1</a>, seems to be that which is here referred to. <span class="ital">Yet have ye not returned unto me — </span>Nevertheless ye have not been brought to a sense of your sins, to any sorrow for them, or to any sincere purpose of amendment. <span class="ital">Also I have withholden the rain, when there were yet three months to the harvest — </span>At a season when your country most needed it, and when it had been wont to fall most plentifully. <span class="ital">And I caused it to rain upon one city, and not upon another — </span>And, to make it more remarkable, I caused it to rain upon cities or places adjoining to yours, at the same time that the drought was so great on all your territories. This may import that God punished them with drought at the same time when he sent rain upon the cities of Judah; making a remarkable difference between Israel and Judah, like that which he formerly made between Egypt and the land of Goshen. <span class="ital">One piece was rained upon, </span>&c. — This seems to be spoken of those parts which lay quite contiguous to the lands of other nations, of which parts, though they touched each other, yet rain fell upon the one and not upon the other; the consequence of which was, that the one piece of land was withered, or scorched up for want of moisture, while the adjoining one was green and flourishing. <span class="ital">So two or three cities wandered, </span>&c. — So the inhabitants of several of your cities went to some city or other without your territories for the sake of getting water to quench their thirst. <span class="ital">But they were not satisfied — </span>They could not obtain a sufficient quantity.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:6-13 See the folly of carnal hearts; they wander from one creature to another, seeking for something to satisfy, and labour for that which satisfies not; yet, after all, they will not incline their ear to Him in whom they might find all they can want. Preaching the gospel is as rain, and every thing withers where this rain is wanting. It were well if people were as wise for their souls as they are for their bodies; and, when they have not this rain near, would go and seek it where it is to be had. As the Israelites persisted in rebellion and idolatry, the Lord was coming against them as an adversary. Ere long, we must meet our God in judgment; but we shall not be able to stand before him, if he tries us according to our doings. If we would prepare to meet our God with comfort, at the awful period of his coming, we must now meet him in Christ Jesus, the eternal Son of the Father, who came to save lost sinners. We must seek him while he is to be found.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And I, I too have given you - Such had been their gifts to God, worthless, because destitute of that which alone God requires of His creatures, a loving, simple, single-hearted, loyal obedience. So then God had but one gift which He could bestow, one only out of the rich storehouse of His mercies, since all besides were abused - chastisement. Yet this too is a great gift of God, a pledge of His love, who willed not that they should perish; an earnest of greater favors, had they used it. It is a great gift of God, that He should care for us, so as to chasten us. The chastisements too were no ordinary chastisements, but those which God forewarned in the law, that He would send, and, if they repented, He would, amid the chastisements, forgive. This famine God had sent everywhere, "in all their cities," and "in all their places," great and small. Israel thought that its calves, that is, nature, gave them these things. "She did not know," God saith, "that I gave her corn and wine and oil;" but said, "These are my rewards that my lovers have given me" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm">Hosea 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-12.htm">Hosea 2:12</a>. In the powers and operations of "nature," they forgat the God and Author of nature. It was then the direct corrective of this delusion, that God withheld those powers and functions of nature. So might israel learn, if it would, the vanity of its worship, from its fruitlessness. Some such great famines in the time of Elijah and Elisha <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/17.htm">1 Kings 17</a>; 18; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm">2 Kings 8:1-6</a> Scripture records; but it relates them, only when God visibly interposed to bring, or to remove, or to mitigate them. Amos here speaks of other famines, which God sent, as He foretold in the law, but which produced no genuine fruits of repentance.<p>And ye returned not unto Me - He says not, that they "returned not at all," but that they "returned not wholly, quite back to God" . Nay the emphatic saying, "ye did not return quite to Me," so as to reach Me, implies that they did, after a fashion, return. Israel's worship was a half, halting <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/18-21.htm">1 Kings 18:21</a>, worship. But a half-worship is no worship; a half-repentance is no repentance; repentance for one sin or one set of sins is no repentance, unless the soul repent of all which it can recall wherein it displeased its God. God does not half-forgive; so neither must man half-repent. Yet of its one fundamental sin, the worship of nature for God, Israel would not repent. And so, whatever they did was not that entire repentance, upon which God, in the law, had promised forgiveness; repentance which stopped short of nothing but God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6-11. Jehovah details His several chastisements inflicted with a view to reclaiming them: but adds to each the same sad result, "yet have ye not returned unto Me" (Isa 9:13; Jer 5:3; Ho 7:10); the monotonous repetition of the same burden marking their pitiable obstinacy.<p>cleanness of teeth&#8212;explained by the parallel, "want of bread." The famine alluded to is that mentioned in 2Ki 8:1 [Grotius]. Where there is no food to masticate, the teeth are free from uncleanness, but it is the cleanness of want. Compare Pr 14:4, "Where no oxen are, the crib is clean." So spiritually, where all is outwardly smooth and clean, it is often because there is no solid religion. Better fighting and fears with real piety, than peace and respectable decorum without spiritual life.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And I, </span> the Lord, who gave many blessings to win you to repentance, hath also tried what might be done by judgments. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cleanness of teeth:</span> this is a description of famine by one effect of it; where meat fails the teeth are not fouled, as where it is eaten. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In all your cities; </span> it was a general famine, and probably it was that long famine, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-1.htm" title="Then spoke Elisha to the woman, whose son he had restored to life, saying, Arise, and go you and your household, and sojourn wherever you can sojourn: for the LORD has called for a famine; and it shall also come on the land seven years.">2 Kings 8:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Want of bread in all your places; </span> if there were some bread, yet it was very scarce every where: this passage explains the former. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Yet have ye not returned unto me; </span> yet this starving people repented not of their idolatries, nor cast off their idols; left not their sins of oppression and cruelty, &c.; see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-12.htm" title="Therefore also now, said the LORD, turn you even to me with all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with mourning:">Joel 2:12</a>,13</span>; what you did like returning was partial and hypocritical, and not lasting. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/amos/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities,....

When Israel suffers from them the prophets take for granted that they are for the people’s punishment … And although some, perhaps rightly, have scoffed at the exaggerated form of the belief, that God is angry with the sons of men every time drought or floods happen, yet the instinct is sound which in all ages has led religious people to feel that such things are inflicted for moral purposes. In the economy of the universe there may be ends of a purely physical kind served by such disasters apart altogether from their meaning to man. But man at least learns from them that nature does not exist solely for feeding, clothing, and keeping him wealthy … Amos had the more need to explain those disasters as the work of God and His righteousness, because his contemporaries, while willing to grant Jehovah leadership in war, were tempted to attribute to the Canaanite gods of the land all power over the seasons [<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-5.htm" title="For their mother has played the harlot: she that conceived them has done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.">Hosea 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-8.htm" title="For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for Baal.">Hosea 2:8</a>]” (G.

The famines to which Amos alludes are not recorded. Plainly they were not fortuitous, but were providential inflictions, in accordance with previous warnings <span class="cmt_word">Yet have ye not returned unto me.</span> Pusey notes that the words imply, not that they returned not at all, but that they did after a fashion return, but not so as to reach God, their repentance being a half-repentance and their worship a half-worship, and therefore unacceptable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Because Israel would not desist from its idolatry, and entirely forgot the goodness of its God, He would destroy its might and glory (<a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1-8</a>). Because it did not acknowledge the Lord as its help, its throne would be annihilated along with its capital; but this judgment would become to all that were penitent a regeneration to newness of life. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a>. "When Ephraim spake, there was terror; he exalted himself in Israel; then he offended through Baal, and died. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>. And now they continue to sin, and make themselves molten images out of their silver, idols according to their understanding: manufacture of artists is it all: they say of them, Sacrificers of men: let them kiss calves." In order to show how deeply Israel had fallen through its apostasy, the prophet points to the great distinction which the tribe of Ephraim formerly enjoyed among the tribes of Israel. The two clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-1.htm">Hosea 13:1</a> cannot be so connected together as that &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; should be taken as a continuation of the infinitive &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;. The emphatic &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is irreconcilable with this. We must rather take &#1512;&#1514;&#1514; (&#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;., in Aramaean  equals  &#1512;&#1496;&#1496;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-24.htm">Jeremiah 49:24</a>, terror, tremor) as the apodosis to kedabbe&#772;r 'Ephraim (when Ephraim spake), like &#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/4-7.htm">Genesis 4:7</a> : "As Ephraim spake there was terror," i.e., men listened with fear and trembling (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-21.htm">Job 29:21</a>). &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; is used intransitively, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-10.htm">Psalm 89:10</a>. Ephraim, i.e., the tribe of Ephraim, "exalted itself in Israel," - not "it was distinguished among its brethren" (Hitzig), but "it raised itself to the government." The prophet has in his mind the attempts made by Ephraim to get the rule among the tribes, which led eventually to the secession of the ten tribes from the royal family of David, and the establishment of the kingdom of Israel by the side of that of Judah. When Ephraim had secured this, the object of its earnest endeavours, it offended through Baal; i.e., not only through the introduction of the worship of Baal in the time of Ahab (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm">1 Kings 16:31</a>.), but even through the establishment of the worship of the calves under Jeroboam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-28.htm">1 Kings 12:28</a>), through which Jehovah was turned into a Baal. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514;, used of the state or kingdom, is equivalent to "was given up to destruction" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-2.htm">Amos 2:2</a>). The dying commenced with the introduction of the unlawful worship (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-30.htm">1 Kings 12:30</a>). From this sin Ephraim (the people of the ten tribes) did not desist: they still continue to sin, and make themselves molten images, etc., contrary to the express prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-4.htm">Leviticus 19:4</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-4.htm">Exodus 20:4</a>). These words are not merely to be understood as signifying, that they added other idolatrous images in Gilgal and Beersheba to the golden calves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm">Amos 8:14</a>); but they also involve their obstinate adherence to the idolatrous worship introduced by Jeroboam (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-16.htm">2 Kings 17:16</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1491;&#1501; from &#1514;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1492;, with the feminine termination dropped on account of the suffix (according to Ewald, 257, d; although in the note Ewald regards this formation as questionable, and doubts the correctness of the reading): "according to their understanding," i.e., their proficiency in art.<p>The meaning of the second hemistich, which is very difficult, depends chiefly upon the view we take of &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;, viz., whether we render these words "they who sacrifice men," as the lxx, the fathers, and many of the rabbins and Christian expositors have done; or "the sacrificers of (among) men," as Kimchi, Bochart, Ewald, and others do, after the analogy of &#1488;&#1489;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497; &#1488;&#1491;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/29-19.htm">Isaiah 29:19</a>. Apart from this, however, zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m cannot possibly be taken as an independent sentence, such as "they sacrifice men," or "human sacrificers are they," unless with the lxx we change the participle &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497; arbitrarily into the perfect &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;. As the words read, they must be connected with what follows or with what precedes. But if we connect them with what follows, we fail to obtain any suitable thought, whether we render it "human sacrificers (those who sacrifice men) kiss calves," or "the sacrificers among men kiss calves." The former is open to the objection that human sacrifices were not offered to the calves (i.e., to Jehovah, as worshipped under the symbol of a calf), but only to Moloch, and that the worshippers of Moloch did not kiss calves. The latter, "men who offer sacrifice kiss calves," might indeed be understood in this sense, that the prophet intended thereby to denounce the great folly, that men should worship animals; but this does not suit the preceding words &#1492;&#1501; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, and it is impossible to see in what sense they could be employed. There is no other course left, therefore, than to connect Zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m with what precedes, though not in the way proposed by Ewald, viz., "even to these do sacrificers of men say." This rendering is open to the following objections: (1) that &#1492;&#1501; after &#1500;&#1492;&#1501; would have to be taken as an emphatic repetition of the pronoun, and we cannot find any satisfactory ground for this; and, (2) what is still more important, the fact that 'a&#770;ma&#770;r would be used absolutely, in the sense of "they speak in prayer," which, even apart from the "prayer," cannot be sustained by any other analogous example. These difficulties vanish if we take Zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m as an explanatory apposition to he&#772;m: "of them (the &#8219;a&#774;tsabb&#305;&#772;m) they say, viz., the sacrificers from among men (i.e., men who sacrifice), Let them worship calves." By the apposition zo&#772;bheche&#772; 'a&#770;da&#770;m, and the fact that the object &#8219;a&#774;ga&#770;l&#305;&#772;m is placed first, so that it stands in immediate contrast to 'a&#770;da&#770;m, the absurdity of men kissing calves, i.e., worshipping them with kisses (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-18.htm">1 Kings 19:18</a>), is painted as it were before the eye. </body></html>
