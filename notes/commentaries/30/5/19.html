The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As if a man, did flee from a lion - The Day of the Lord is a day of terror on every side. Before and behind, without and within, abroad under the roof of heaven, or under the shelter of his own, everywhere is terror and death. The Syrian bear is said to have been more fierce and savage than the lion. For its fierceness and voracity <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>, God made it, in Daniel's vision, a symbol of the empire of the Medes. From both lion and bear there might be escape by flight. When the man had "leaned his hand" trustfully "on the wall" of his own house, "and the serpent bit him," there was no escape. He had fled from death to death, from peril to destruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. As if a man did flee &#8230; a lion, and a bear met him&#8212;Trying to escape one calamity, he falls into another. This perhaps implies that in Am 5:18 their ironical desire for the day of the Lord was as if it would be an escape from existing calamities. The coming of the day of the Lord would be good news to us, if true: for we have served God (that is, the golden calves). So do hypocrites flatter themselves as to death and judgment, as if these would be a relief from existing ills of life. The lion may from generosity spare the prostrate, but the bear spares none (compare Job 20:24; Isa 24:18).<p>leaned &#8230; on the wall&#8212;on the side wall of the house, to support himself from falling.

That is, should the day of the Lord come as they desired, they would not be the better for it; it would be only going from one trouble to another, like escaping Scylla, and falling into Charybdis: or as if a man, upon the sight of a lion, and at his yell, should take to his heels, and flee "from the face" of him, as the phrase is (i), and a bear, a less generous, and more cruel and voracious creature, especially when: bereaved of its whelps, should meet him, and seize him: or should: he get clear of them both, <p>or went into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him; should he get into a house, and so escape the lion and the bear, and lean upon the wall of the house to support and ease him, being out of breath in running from these creatures; yet a serpent lurking in the wall of an old house bites him, and the venom and poison of it issues in his death; so he gains nothing by fleeing from the lion, or escaping the bear. These proverbial expressions signify that the Israelites would be no gainers by the day of the Lord, but rather fall into greater evils, and more distressing calamities. Some Jewish writers interpret the lion and the bear of Laban and Esau; the lion (they say (k)) is Laban, who pursued after Jacob to take away his life; the bear is Esau, who stood in the way to kill all that came, the mother with the children; but are much better interpreted of the Chaldeans, Persians, and Grecians, by Jerom; whose words are, <p>"fleeing from the face of Nebuchadnezzar the lion, ye will be met by Ahasuerus, under whom, was the history of Esther; or the empire of the Assyrians and Chaldeans being destroyed, the Medes and Persians shall arise; and when upon the reign of Cyrus ye shall have returned, and at the command of, Darius shall have begun to build the house of the Lord, and have confidence in the temple, so as to rest in it, lean your weary hands on its walls; then shall come Alexander king of the Macedonians, or Antiochus, surnamed Epiphanes, who shall abide in the temple, and bite likes serpent, not without in Babylon, and in Susa, but within the borders of the holy land; by which it appears that the day ye desire is not a day of light and joy, but of darkness and sorrow.'' <p>The interpretation is pretty and ingenious enough, since the characters of the lion, bear, and serpent, agree with the respective persons and people mentioned; Nebuchadnezzar is often compared to a lion, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-7.htm">Jeremiah 4:7</a>; and the Babylonian and Chaldean monarchy is represented by one in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>; and the Persian monarchy by a bear, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>; to which the Persians are compared, the Jews say (l), because they eat and drink like a bear, are as fat as bears, and hairy like them, and as restless as they; and so the Persians were noted for their luxury and lust, as well as their cruelty; and, wearing long hair, are called hairy persons in the Delphic oracle, which Herodotus (m) interprets of them; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-5.htm">Daniel 7:5</a>; and Antiochus may not unfitly be compared to a serpent; see See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-23.htm">Daniel 8:23</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-24.htm">Daniel 8:24</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-25.htm">Daniel 8:25</a>; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-23.htm">Daniel 11:23</a>; but what is to be objected to this sense is, that the words are spoken to the ten tribes, or Israel, who were carried captive by the Assyrians; and not the two tribes, or the Jews, who fell into the hands, first of the Chaldeans, then the Persians, and then the Grecians, particularly into the hands of Antiochus; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-4.htm">Daniel 7:4</a>. <p>(i) "a facie", V.

Every place is full of danger - the open country, the shelter of the house.

"Hear this, ye old men; and attend, all ye inhabitants of the land! Has such a thing indeed happened in your days, or in the days of your fathers? <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-1.htm">Joel 1:1</a>. Ye shall tell your sons of it, and your sons their sons, and their sons the next generation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>. The leavings of the gnawer the multiplier ate, and the leavings of the multiplier the licker ate, and the leavings of the licker the devourer ate." Not only for the purpose of calling the attention of the hearers to his address, but still more to set forth the event of which he is about to speak as something unheard of - a thing that has never happened before, and therefore is a judgment inflicted by God - the prophet commences with the question addressed to the old men, whose memory went the furthest back, and to all the inhabitants of Judah, whether they had ever experienced anything of the kind, or heard of such a thing from their fathers; and with the command to relate it to their children, and grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.<p>(Note: "As he is inquiring concerning the past according to the command of Moses in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-7.htm">Deuteronomy 32:7</a>, he asks the old men, who have been taught by long experience, and are accustomed, whenever they see anything unusual, to notice that this is not according to the ordinary course of nature, which they have observed for so many years. And since this existing calamity, caused by the insects named, has lasted longer and pressed more heavily than usual, he admonishes them to carry their memory back to the former days, and see whether anything of the kind ever happened naturally before; and if no example can be found, the prophet's advice is, that they should recognise this as the hand of God from heaven." - Tarnov.)<p>"The inhabitants of the land" are the inhabitants of Judah, as it was only with this kingdom that Joel was occupied (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>). &#1494;&#1488;&#1514; is the occurrence related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-4.htm">Joel 1:4</a>, which is represented by the question "Has this been in your days?" as a fact just experienced. Yether hagga&#770;za&#770;m, the leavings of the gnawer, i.e., whatever the gnawer leaves unconsumed of either vegetables or plants. The four names given to the locusts, viz., ga&#770;za&#770;m, 'arbeh, yeleq, and cha&#770;sil, are not the names applied in natural history to four distinct species, or four different generations of locusts; nor does Joel describe the swarms of two successive years, so that "ga&#770;za&#770;m is the migratory locust, which visits Palestine chiefly in the autumn, 'arbeh the young brood, yeleq the young locust in the last stage of its transformation, or before changing its skin for the fourth time, and cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the perfect locust after this last change, so that as the brood sprang from the ga&#770;za&#770;m, cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l would be equivalent to ga&#770;za&#770;m" (Credner). This explanation is not only at variance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, where ga&#770;za&#770;m stands last, after cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, but is founded generally merely upon a false interpretation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/3-15.htm">Nahum 3:15-16</a> (see the passage) and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-27.htm">Jeremiah 51:27</a>, where the adjective sa&#770;ma&#770;r (horridus, horrible), appended to yeleq, from sa&#770;ma&#770;r, to shudder, by no means refers to the rough, horny, wing-sheath of the young locusts, and cannot be sustained from the usage of the language, It is impossible to point out any difference in usage between ga&#770;za&#770;m and cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, or between these two words and 'arbeh. The word ga&#770;za&#770;m, from ga&#770;za&#770;m, to cut off (in Arabic, Ethiopic, and the Rabb.), occurs only in this passage, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/4-9.htm">Amos 4:9</a>, where it is applied to a swarm of flying locusts, which leave the vine, fig-tree, and olive, perfectly bare, as it is well known that all locusts do, when, as in Amos, the vegetables and field fruits have been already destroyed. 'Arbeh, from ra&#770;bha&#770;h, to be many, is the common name of the locust, and indeed in all probability of the migratory locust, because this always appears in innumerable swarms. Cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l, from cha&#770;sal, to eat off, designates the locust (ha&#770;'arbeh), according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-38.htm">Deuteronomy 28:38</a>, by its habit of eating off the field crops and tree fruits, and is therefore used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-37.htm">1 Kings 8:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-28.htm">2 Chronicles 6:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/78-46.htm">Psalm 78:46</a>, as synonymous with ha&#770;'arbeh, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-4.htm">Isaiah 33:4</a> in its stead. Yeleq, from ya&#770;laq  equals  la&#770;qaq, to lick, to lick off, occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/105-34.htm">Psalm 105:34</a> as equivalent to 'arbeh, and in Nahum as synonymous with it; and indeed it there refers expressly to the Egyptian plague of locusts, so that young locusts without wings cannot possibly be thought of. Hagga&#770;za&#770;m the gnawer, hayyeleq the licker, hecha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the devourer, are therefore simply poetical epithets applied to the 'arbeh, which never occur in simple plain prose, but are confined to the loftier (rhetorical and poetical) style. Moreover, the assumption that Joel is speaking of swarms of locusts of two successive years, is neither required by <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a> (see the comm. on this verse), nor reconcilable with the contents of the verse itself. If the 'arbeh eats what the ga&#770;za&#770;m has left, and the yeleq what is left by the 'arbeh, we cannot possibly think of the field and garden fruits of two successive years, because the fruits of the second year are not the leavings of the previous year, but have grown afresh in the year itself.<p>(Note: Bochart (Hieroz. iii. p. 290, ed. Ros.) has already expressed the same opinion. "If," he says, "the different species had been assigned to so many different years, the 'arbeh would not be said to have eaten the leavings of the ga&#770;za&#770;m, or the yeleq the leavings of the 'arbeh, or the cha&#770;s&#305;&#772;l the leavings of the yeleq; for the productions of this year are not the leavings of last, nor can what will spring up in future be looked upon as the leavings of this. Therefore, whether this plague of locusts was confined to one year, or was repeated for several years, which seems to be the true inference from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-25.htm">Joel 2:25</a>, I do not think that the different species of locusts are to be assigned to different years respectively, but that they all entered Judaea in the same year; so that when one swarm departed from a field, another followed, to eat up the leavings of the previous swarm, if there were any; and that this was repeated as many times as was necessary to consume the whole, so that nothing at all should be left to feed either man or beast.")<p>The thought is rather this: one swarm of locusts after another has invaded the land, and completely devoured its fruit. The use of several different words, and the division of the locusts into four successive swarms, of which each devours what has been left by its precursor, belong to the rhetorical drapery and individualizing of the thought. The only thing that has any real significance is the number four, as the four kinds of punishment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>, and the four destructive judgments in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>, clearly show. The number four, "the stamp of oecumenicity" (Kliefoth), indicates here the spread of the judgment over the whole of Judah in all directions. </body></html>
