Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forasmuch therefore - (Since they rejected reproof, he pronounces the sentence of God upon them,) "as your treading is upon the poor." This expresses more habitual trampling on the poor, than if he had said, "ye tread upon the poor." They were ever trampling on those who were already of low and depressed condition. "And ye take from him burdens of wheat, presents of wheat." The word always signifies presents, voluntary , or involuntary , what was carried, offered to anyone. They received "wheat" from the poor, cleansed, winnowed, and "sold the refuse <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm">Amos 8:6</a>, requiring what it was wrong to receive, and selling what at the least it was disgraceful not to give. God had expressly forbidden to "lend food for interest" <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-37.htm">Leviticus 25:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-19.htm">Deuteronomy 23:19</a>. It may be that, in order to evade the law, the interest was called "a present."<p>Ye have built house of hewn stone - The houses of Israel were, perhaps most commonly, built of brick dried in the sun only. As least, houses built of hewn stone, like most of our's, are proverbially contrasted with them, as the more solid with the more ordinary building. "The white bricks are fallen down, and we will build with hewn, stones" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-10.htm">Isaiah 9:10</a>. And Ezekiel is bidden to dig through the wall of his house <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>. Houses of stone there were, as appears from the directions as to the unhealthy accretions, called the leprosy of the house <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-34.htm">Leviticus 14:34-48</a>. It may be, however, that their houses of "hewn stone," had a smoothed surface, like our "ashlar." Anyhow, the sin of luxury is not simply measured by the things themselves, but by their relation to ourselves and our condition also; and wrong is not estimated by the extent of the gain and loss of the two parties only, but by the injury inflicted.<p>These men, who built houses, luxurious for them, had wrung from the poor their living, as those do, who beat down the wages of the poor. Therefore they were not to take possession of what was their own; as Ahab, who by murder possessed himself of Naboth's vineyard, forfeited his throne and his life. God, in the law, consulted for the feeling which desires to enter into the fruit of a man's toil. When they should go to war they were to proclaim, "what man" is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man dedicate it. And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard and hath not eaten of it? let him go. and return unto his house, lest he die in the battle and another man eat of it" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/20-5.htm">Deuteronomy 20:5-6</a>. Now God reversed all this, and withdrew the tender love, whereby He had provided it. The words, from their proverbial character, express a principle of God's judgments, that wrong dealing, whereby a man would secure himself or enlarge his inheritance, destroys both. Who poorer than our Lord, bared of all upon the Cross, of whom it had been written, "They persecuted the poor helpless man, that they might slay him who was vexed at the heart" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/109-15.htm">Psalm 109:15</a>, and of whom the Jews said, "Come let us kill Him, that the inheritance may be ours?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/21-38.htm">Matthew 21:38</a>. They killed Him, they said, "lest the Romans take away our place and nation" <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/11-48.htm">John 11:48</a>.

(Heb. Bib. v. 2). "Return, O Israel, to Jehovah thy God; for thou hast stumbled through thy guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-2.htm">Hosea 14:2</a>. Take with you words, and turn to Jehovah; say ye to Him, Forgive all guilt, and accept what is good, that we may offer our lips as bullocks. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-3.htm">Hosea 14:3</a>. Asshur will not help us: we will not ride upon horses, nor say 'Our God' any more to the manufacture of our own hands; for with Thee the orphan findeth compassion." There is no salvation for fallen man without return to God. It is therefore with a call to return to the Lord their God, that the prophet opens the announcement of the salvation with which the Lord will bless His people, whom He has brought to reflection by means of the judgment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-30.htm">Deuteronomy 4:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-1.htm">Deuteronomy 30:1</a>.). &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1506;&#1491; &#1497;&#1497;, to return, to be converted to the Lord, denotes complete conversion; &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1488;&#1500; is, strictly speaking, simply to turn towards God, to direct heart and mind towards Him. By ka&#770;shalta&#770; sin is represented as a false step, which still leaves it possible to return; so that in a call to conversion it is very appropriately chosen. But if the conversion is to be of the right kind, it must begin with a prayer for the forgiveness of sin, and attest itself by the renunciation of earthly help and simple trust in the mercy of God. Israel is to draw near to God in this state of mind. "Take with you words," i.e., do not appear before the Lord empty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-15.htm">Exodus 23:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/34-20.htm">Exodus 34:20</a>); but for this ye do not require outward sacrifices, but simply words, sc. those of confession of your guilt, as the Chaldee has correctly explained it. The correctness of this explanation is evident from the confession of sin which follows, with which they are to come before God. In &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503;, the position of col at the head of the sentence may be accounted for from the emphasis that rests upon it, and the separation of &#8219;a&#770;vo&#772;n, from the fact that col was beginning to acquire more of the force of an adjective, like our all (thus <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/1-9.htm">2 Samuel 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-3.htm">Job 27:3</a> : cf. Ewald, 289, a; Ges. 114, 3, Anm. 1). Qach to&#772;bh means neither "accept goodness," i.e., let goodness be shown thee (Hitzig), nor "take it as good," sc. that we pray (Grotius, Ros.); but in the closest connection with what proceeds: Accept the only good thing that we are able to bring, viz., the sacrifices of our lips. Jerome has given the correct interpretation, viz.: "For unless Thou hadst borne away our evil things, we could not possibly have the good thing which we offer Thee;" according to that which is written elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-27.htm">Psalm 37:27</a>), "Turn from evil, and do good." &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468; ... &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, literally, "we will repay (pay) as young oxen our lips," i.e., present the prayers of our lips as thank-offerings. The expression is to be explained from the fact that shille&#772;m, to wipe off what is owing, to pay, is a technical term, applied to the sacrifice offered in fulfilment of a vow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-22.htm">Deuteronomy 23:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/22-26.htm">Psalm 22:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-14.htm">Psalm 50:14</a>, etc.), and that pa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m, young oxen, were the best animals for thank-offerings (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-5.htm">Exodus 24:5</a>). As such thank-offerings, i.e., in the place of the best animal sacrifices, they would offer their lips, i.e., their prayers, to God (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-17.htm">Psalm 51:17-19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-31.htm">Psalm 69:31-32</a>). In the Sept. rendering, &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, to which there is an allusion in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-15.htm">Hebrews 13:15</a>, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; has been confounded with &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;, as Jerome has already observed. but turning to God requires renunciation of the world, of its power, and of all idolatry. Rebellious Israel placed its reliance upon Assyria and Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-13.htm">Hosea 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/7-11.htm">Hosea 7:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-9.htm">Hosea 8:9</a>). It will do this no longer. The riding upon horses refers partly to the military force of Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm">Isaiah 31:1</a>), and partly to their own (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-7.htm">Hosea 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-7.htm">Isaiah 2:7</a>). For the expression, "neither will we say to the work of our hands," compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-17.htm">Isaiah 42:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-17.htm">Isaiah 44:17</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;, not "Thou with whom," but "for with Thee" ('a&#774;sher as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-24.htm">Deuteronomy 3:24</a>). The thought, "with Thee the orphan findeth compassion," as God promises in His word (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-22.htm">Exodus 22:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-18.htm">Deuteronomy 10:18</a>), serves not only as a reason for the resolution no longer to call the manufacture of their own hands God, but generally for the whole of the penitential prayer, which they are encouraged to offer by the compassionate nature of God. In response to such a penitential prayer, the Lord will heal all His people's wounds, and bestow upon them once more the fulness of the blessings of His grace. The prophet announces this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-4.htm">Isaiah 44:4-8</a> as the answer from the Lord. </body></html>
