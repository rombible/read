The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Is the multitude - There was no deficiency in the amount of offerings. It was admitted that they complied in this respect with the requirements of the law; and that they offered an abundance of sacrifices, so numerous as to be called a multitude - &#1512;&#1489;  ro&#770;b, a vast number. Hypocrites abound in outward religious observances just in proportion to their neglect of the spiritual requirements of God's word; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-23.htm">Matthew 23:23</a>.<p>Your sacrifices - &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;&#1497;&#1499;&#1489;  zibeche&#772;ykeb, from &#1494;&#1489;&#1495;  za&#770;bach, to slay; especially to slay for sacrifice. The word used here denotes any sacrifice which was made by blood; but is distinguished from the burnt-offering from the fat, that this was not entirely consumed. It is applied to the sin-offering, trespass-offering, thank-offering. The word also stands opposed to the offerings which were made without blood &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492;  mincha&#772;h. Any offering that consisted in an animal that was slain came under this general denomination of sacrifice, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-25.htm">Exodus 10:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-8.htm">Leviticus 17:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-5.htm">Numbers 15:5</a>.<p>burnt-offerings - &#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;  'olo&#770;th, from &#1506;&#1500;&#1492;  &#8219;a&#770;la&#770;h, to go up, ascend. It is applied to a sacrifice that was wholly consumed, or made to ascend on an altar. It corresponds to the Greek &#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;  holokauston, that which is entirely consumed. Such offerings abounded among the Hebrews. The burnt-offering was wholly consumed on the altar, excepting the skin and the blood. The blood was sprinkled round the altar, and the other parts of the animal which was slain, were laid upon the altar and entirely burned; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/1.htm">Leviticus 1</a>. This was commonly a voluntary offering; and this shows their zeal to comply with the external forms of religion.<p>I am full - &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;  s'a&#770;ba&#8219;et&#305;&#770;y, I am satiated. The word is usually applied to food and drink, denoting satisfaction, or satiety. It is used here with great force, denoting that their offerings had been so numerous and so incessant, that God was satiated with them. It means that he was weary, tired, disgusted with them. Thus, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-4.htm">Job 7:4</a> : 'I am full - &#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;  s'a&#770;ba&#8219;et&#305;&#770;y - of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of the day.' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-17.htm">Proverbs 25:17</a> :<p>Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbor's house,<p>Lest he be weary (Hebrew full) of thee, and hate thee.<p>Fat ... - They were required to offer, not the lame, or the diseased <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-21.htm">Deuteronomy 15:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-1.htm">Deuteronomy 17:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-12.htm">Leviticus 23:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/malachi/1-7.htm">Malachi 1:7-8</a>; and God admits here that they had externally complied with this requirement. The fat was burned on the altar.<p>I delight not - That is; I delight; not in them when offered without the heart; or I delight not in them in comparison with works of righteousness; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/4-9.htm">Psalm 4:9-13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-16.htm">Psalm 51:16-19</a>. <p><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-21.htm">Amos 5:21</a>I hate, I despise your feasts - Israel clave to its heart's sin, the worship of the true God, under the idol-form of the calf; else, it would fain be conscientious and scrupulous. It had its "feasts" of solemn "joy" and the "restraint" of its "solemn assemblies" , which all were constrained to keep, abstaining from all servile work. They offered "whole burnt offerings," the token of self-sacrifice, in which the sacrificer retained nothing to himself, but gave the whole freely to God. They offered also "peace offerings," as tokens of the willing thankfulness of souls at peace with God. What they offered, was the best of its kind, "fatted beasts." Hymns of praise, full-toned chorus, instrumental music! What was missing, Israel thought, to secure them the favor of God? Love and obedience. "If ye love Me, keep My commandments." And so those things, whereby they hoped to propitiate God, were the object of His displeasure. "I hate, I despise, I will not accept" with good pleasure; "I will not regard," look toward, "I will not hear, will not smell." The words, "I will not smell," reminded them of that threat in the law" <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a>, "I will make your cities waste and bring your sanctuaries unto desolation, and I will not smell the savor of your sweet odors." In so many ways does God declare that He would not accept or endure, what they all the while were building upon, as grounds of their acceptance. And yet so secure were they, that the only sacrifice which they did not offer, was the sin or trespass offering. Worshiping "nature," not a holy, Personal, God, they had no sense of unholiness, for which to plead the Atoning Sacrifice to come. Truly each Day of Judgment unveils much self-deceit. How much more the Last! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22. meat offerings&#8212;flour, &c.

The daily burnt offerings, morning and night, and others which were wholly the Lord's; and the "minchah", or bread offering, which went along with them; in which they thought to do God service, and to merit his favour; but instead of that they were unacceptable to him, being neither offered up in a proper place, if in a right manner according to the law of Moses; however, not in the faith of the great sacrifice, Christ; nor attended with repentance towards God: <p>neither will I regard the peace offerings of your fat beasts; even though their peace offerings were of the best of the herd. Aben Ezra says the creature here meant is the same which in the Ishmaelitish or Arabic language is called "giamus", a creature bigger than an ox, and like one, which is called a buffle or buffalo. And so Ben Melech says it means one of the kinds of the larger cattle; for not a lamb, a ram, or a sheep, is meant, as the word is sometimes rendered by the Septuagint, but a creature like an ox; not larger, or the wild ox, as the above Hebrew writers, but smaller; with which agrees the description Bellonius (n) gives of the Syrian "bubalus" or "buffalo", which he calls a small ox, full bodied, little, smooth, sleek, fat, and well made; and is no doubt the same the Arabs call "almari", from its smoothness. <p>(n) Apud Bochart.

The commonest and most popular kinds of sacrifice are particularized as rejected by Jehovah. The <span class="ital">burnt</span>- and <span class="ital">peace</span>-offerings are often mentioned in the historical books, and were frequently sacrificed together (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-24.htm" title="An altar of earth you shall make to me, and shall sacrifice thereon your burnt offerings, and your peace offerings, your sheep, and your oxen: in all places where I record my name I will come to you, and I will bless you.">Exodus 20:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-6.htm" title="And they rose up early on the morrow, and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; and the people sat down to eat and to drink, and rose up to play.">Exodus 32:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/20-26.htm" title="Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up, and came to the house of God, and wept, and sat there before the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">Jdg 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-4.htm" title="And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.">Jdg 21:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-8.htm" title="And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I will come down to you, to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shall you tarry, till I come to you, and show you what you shall do.">1 Samuel 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/13-9.htm" title="And Saul said, Bring here a burnt offering to me, and peace offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.">1 Samuel 13:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-17.htm" title="And they brought in the ark of the LORD, and set it in his place, in the middle of the tabernacle that David had pitched for it: and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.">2 Samuel 6:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-25.htm" title="And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was entreated for the land, and the plague was stayed from Israel.">2 Samuel 24:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-15.htm" title="And Solomon awoke; and, behold, it was a dream. And he came to Jerusalem, and stood before the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and offered up burnt offerings, and offered peace offerings, and made a feast to all his servants.">1 Kings 3:15</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a>, where ‘the fat of fed beasts’ is an allusion to the peace-offering). The peace-offering, being the sacrifice most commonly offered, is also often called ‘sacrifice’ (lit. <span class="ital">slaughtering</span>) simply: <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/18-12.htm" title="And Jethro, Moses' father in law, took a burnt offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father in law before God.">Exodus 18:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm" title="And thither you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herds and of your flocks:">Deuteronomy 12:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/6-15.htm" title="And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day to the LORD.">1 Samuel 6:15</a> <span class="ital">al</span>.).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">meat offerings</span>] <span class="bld">meal</span>-<span class="ital">offerings</span>, or <span class="ital">cereal offerings</span>. The word ‘meat’ has altered its meaning since the time when the A.V. was made, and is now restricted to flesh: so that the rendering ‘meat offering’ for offerings consisting exclusively of either parched corn or various preparations of flour (see Leviticus 2) has become altogether misleading. The Heb. word <span class="ital">minḥah</span> means properly a <span class="ital">present</span> or <span class="ital">gift</span>, especially one offered to a king or noble, to do him homage or secure his favour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-13.htm" title="And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;">Genesis 32:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/43-11.htm" title="And their father Israel said to them, If it must be so now, do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels, and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:">Genesis 43:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-27.htm" title="But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us? And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held his peace.">1 Samuel 10:27</a>), and euphemistically for tribute, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-2.htm" title="And he smote Moab, and measured them with a line, casting them down to the ground; even with two lines measured he to put to death, and with one full line to keep alive. And so the Moabites became David's servants, and brought gifts.">2 Samuel 8:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/8-6.htm" title="Then David put garrisons in Syria of Damascus: and the Syrians became servants to David, and brought gifts. And the LORD preserved David wherever he went.">2 Samuel 8:6</a> &c.: hence it is used sometimes in a general sense of gifts offered in sacrifice to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/4-3.htm" title="And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering to the LORD....">Genesis 4:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-15.htm" title="And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not you their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them.">Numbers 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-17.htm" title="Why the sin of the young men was very great before the LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.">1 Samuel 2:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-29.htm" title="Why kick you at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in my habitation; and honor your sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the most chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?">1 Samuel 2:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/26-19.htm" title="Now therefore, I pray you, let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD have stirred you up against me, let him accept an offering: but if they be the children of men, cursed be they before the LORD; for they have driven me out this day from abiding in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, Go, serve other gods.">1 Samuel 26:19</a>); in the priestly sections of the Pent., on the other hand, it is used exclusively in the narrower and technical sense of a ‘meal-offering.’ It seems therefore that the custom must have gradually grown up of designating animal sacrifices by their special names (burnt-offering, peace-offering &c.), while <span class="ital">minḥah</span> was more and more restricted to vegetable offerings alone. This double application of the term sometimes makes it uncertain whether ‘offering’ in general, or ‘meal-offering’ in particular, is denoted by it. Where, however, as here, it stands beside the names of two other species of sacrifice, it has the presumption of being used to denote a special kind likewise (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/22-23.htm" title="That we have built us an altar to turn from following the LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering, or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself require it;">Joshua 22:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-23.htm" title="But his wife said to him, If the LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat offering at our hands, neither would he have showed us all these things, nor would as at this time have told us such things as these.">Jdg 13:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-64.htm" title="The same day did the king hallow the middle of the court that was before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings: because the brazen altar that was before the LORD was too little to receive the burnt offerings, and meat offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.">1 Kings 8:64</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">fat beasts</span>] or <span class="ital">fatlings</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-13.htm" title="And it was so, that when they that bore the ark of the LORD had gone six paces, he sacrificed oxen and fatted calves.">2 Samuel 6:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-9.htm" title="And Adonijah slew sheep and oxen and fat cattle by the stone of Zoheleth, which is by Enrogel, and called all his brothers the king's sons, and all the men of Judah the king's servants:">1 Kings 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-19.htm" title="And he has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the host: but Solomon your servant has he not called.">1 Kings 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/1-25.htm" title="For he is gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fat cattle and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the host, and Abiathar the priest; and, behold, they eat and drink before him, and say, God save king Adonijah.">1 Kings 1:25</a>, and (in the same connexion) <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-11.htm" title="To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices to me? said the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.">Isaiah 1:11</a> (where, on account of the word <span class="ital">fat</span>, with which it is joined, it is in the English version rendered <span class="ital">fed beasts</span>).

In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25-26</a>, not only are the ants described as a people (&#8219;a&#770;m), but the locusts also; although it is said of them that they have no king. And &#8219;a&#770;m is synonymous with go&#772;i, which has indeed very frequently the idea of that which is hostile, and even here is used in this sense; though it by no means signifies a heathen nation, but occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a> by the side of &#8219;a&#770;m, as an epithet applied to the people of Jehovah (i.e., Israel: see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The weapons of this army consist in its teeth, its "bite," which grinds in pieces as effectually as the teeth of the lion or the bite of the lioness (&#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-17.htm">Job 29:17</a>). The suffix attached to &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497; does not refer to Jehovah, but to the prophet, who speaks in the name of the people, so that it is the land of the people of God. And this also applies to the suffixes in &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>. In the description of the devastation caused by the army of locusts, the vine and fig-tree are mentioned as the noblest productions of the land, which the Lord has given to His people for their inheritance (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>). &#1500;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, literally, for crushing. The suffix in cha&#774;sa&#770;pha&#770;h refers, no doubt, simply to the vine as the principal object, the fig-tree being mentioned casually in connection with it. Cha&#770;saph, to strip, might be understood as referring simply to the leaves of the vine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a>); but what follows shows that the gnawing or eating away of the bark is also included. Hishl&#305;&#772;kh, to throw away not merely what is uneatable, "that which is not green and contains no sap" (Hitzig), but the vine itself, which the locusts have broken when eating off its leaves and bark. The branches of the vine have become white through the eating off of the bark (sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;g&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>).<p>(Note: H. Ludolf, in his Histor. Aethiop. i. c. 13, 16, speaking of the locusts, says: "Neither herbs, nor shrubs, nor trees remain unhurt. Whatever is either grassy or covered with leaves, is injured, as if it had been burnt with fire. Even the bark of trees is nibbled with their teeth, so that the injury is not confined to one year alone.") </body></html>
