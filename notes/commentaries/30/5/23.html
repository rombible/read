The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take thou away from Me - Literally, "from upon Me," that is, from being a burden to Me, a weight on Me. So God says by Isaiah, "your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hateth; they are a burden upon Me; I am weary to bear them" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>. Their "songs" and hymns were but a confused, tumultuous, "noise," since they had not the harmony of love.<p>For - (And) the melody of thy viols I will not hear - Yet the "nebel," probably a sort of harp, was almost exclusively consecrated to the service of God, and the Psalms were God's own writing. Doubtless they sounded harmoniously in their own ears; but it reached no further. Their melody, like much Church-music, was for itself, and ended in itself. : "Let Christian chanters learn hence, not to set the whole devotion of Psalmody in a good voice, subtlety of modulation and rapid intonation, etc., quavering like birds, to tickle the ears of the curious, take them off to themselves and away from prayer, lest they hear from God, 'I will not hear the melody of thy viols.' Let them learn that of the Apostle, 'I will sing with the Spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also' <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-15.htm">1 Corinthians 14:15</a>." Augustine, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/30-1.htm">Psalm 30:1-12</a>; Enarr. iv. (p. 203. Oxford Translation) L.: "If the Psalm prays, pray; if it sorrows, sorrow; if it is glad, rejoice; if full of hope, hope; if of fear, fear. For whatever is therein written, is our mirror."<p>Augustine in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119.htm">Psalm 119</a> (n. 9. T. v. p. 470. Old Testament) L.: "How many are loud in voice, dumb in heart! How many lips are silent, but their love is loud! For the ears of God are to the heart of man. As the ears of the body are to the mouth of man, so the heart of man is to the ears of God. Many are heard with closed lips, and many who cry aloud are not heard." Dionysius: "God says, 'I will not hear," as He says, 'praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner' (Ecclesiaticus 15:9), and, 'to the ungodly saith God, what hast thou to do, to declare My statutes?' <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-16.htm">Psalm 50:16</a>, and, 'he that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall be abomination' <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/28-9.htm">Proverbs 28:9</a>. It is not meant hereby that the wicked ought wholly to abstain from the praise of God and from prayers, but that they should be diligent to amend, and know that through such imperfect services they cannot be saved." The prophet urges upon them the terribleness of the Day of Judgment, that they might feel and flee its terribleness, before it comes. He impresses on them the fruitlessness of their prayers, that, amending, they might so pray, that God would hear them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

Although there is no excuse for the same Heb. word being thus rendered differently in one and the same version, it is true that the exact instrument meant is uncertain. The LXX. usually represent <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> by <span class="greekheb">νάβλα</span>, or (Psalms generally, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm" title="And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.">Isaiah 5:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-27.htm" title="And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.">Nehemiah 12:27</a>) <span class="greekheb">ψαλτήριον</span>, here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a> by the general term <span class="greekheb">ὄργανα</span>. The <span class="greekheb">νάβλα</span> was known to the Greeks as a Sidonian instrument (Athen. iv. p. 175); and we learn from Ovid (<span class="ital">Ars Am</span>. 3. 327) that it was played <span class="ital">duplici palma</span>. It is often in the O.T. coupled with the <span class="ital">kinnôr</span>; according to Josephus (<span class="ital">Ant</span>. 8. 3. 8) the difference between the <span class="greekheb">κινύρα</span> (= <span class="ital">kinnôr</span>) and the <span class="greekheb">νάβλα</span> was that the former had ten strings and was played with the plectrum, the latter had twelve notes, and was played with the hand. These are substantially all the data which we possess for determining what instrument the <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> was. <span class="ital">Kinnôr</span> in A.V., R.V., is always represented by <span class="ital">harp</span>: and if this rendering be correct, <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> might well be the <span class="ital">lyre</span>. There is, however, force in the remark[226] that the <span class="ital">kinnôr</span> is mentioned much more frequently than the <span class="ital">nçbhel</span>, and seems to have been in more common use; the <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> was used at the feasts of the wealthy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-5.htm" title="That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves instruments of music, like David;">Amos 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm" title="And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD, neither consider the operation of his hands.">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-11.htm" title="Your pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of your viols: the worm is spread under you, and the worms cover you.">Isaiah 14:11</a>), or in religious ceremonies; it was therefore probably a more elaborate and expensive instrument. This consideration would point to <span class="ital">kinnôr</span> being the <span class="ital">lyre</span>, and <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> the <span class="ital">harp</span>. The large and heavy stationary harp of modern times must not, however, be thought of: the <span class="ital">nçbhel</span> could be played while the performer was walking (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm" title="After that you shall come to the hill of God, where is the garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when you are come thither to the city, that you shall meet a company of prophets coming down from the high place with a psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them; and they shall prophesy:">1 Samuel 10:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/6-5.htm" title="And David and all the house of Israel played before the LORD on all manner of instruments made of fir wood, even on harps, and on psalteries, and on tambourines, and on cornets, and on cymbals.">2 Samuel 6:5</a>); and the ancients had small portable harps, of triangular shape (called accordingly by the Greeks <span class="greekheb">τρίγωνα</span>), which could be so used[227]. The word <span class="ital">nçbhel</span>, however, also means in Hebrew a <span class="ital">wine-skin</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-24.htm" title="And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the child was young.">1 Samuel 1:24</a>), and an <span class="ital">earthen jar</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-14.htm" title="And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there shall not be found in the bursting of it a shard to take fire from the hearth, or to take water with out of the pit.">Isaiah 30:14</a>); hence if the name of the musical instrument be etymologically the same word, it would seem rather to have denoted one possessing a bulging body or resonance-box: so that, after all, it is possible that some kind of <span class="ital">lute</span> or <span class="ital">guitar</span> may be the instrument mentioned[228].<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[225] All these names of instruments occur frequently in old English writers, though they are now practically obsolete. The <span class="ital">viol</span> (Norm. <span class="ital">viele</span>, Prov. <span class="ital">viula</span>, Span, <span class="ital">vihuela, viola</span>, Dan. <span class="ital">fiddel</span>, A.-S. <span class="ital">fidele</span>,—from Low Lat. <span class="ital">vitula, vidula</span>), was a bowed instrument, in use from the 15th to the 18th centuries, an early form of the modern violin.

"Awake, ye drunken ones, and weep! and howl, all ye drinkers of wine! at the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a>. For a people has come up over my land, a strong one, and innumerable: its teeth are lion's teeth, and it has the bite of a lioness. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>. It has made my vine a wilderness, and my fig-tree into sticks. Peeling, it has peeled it off, and cast it away: its shoots have grown white." &#1492;&#1511;&#1497;&#1509; to awake out of the reeling of intoxication, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-35.htm">Proverbs 23:35</a>. They are to howl for the new wine, the fresh sweet juice of the grape, because with the destruction of the vines it is taken away and destroyed from their mouth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-6.htm">Joel 1:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a> announce through whom. In the expression go&#772;i &#8219;a&#770;la&#770;h (a people has come up) the locusts are represented as a warlike people, because they devastate the land like a hostile army. Go&#772;i furnishes no support to the allegorical view. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-25.htm">Proverbs 30:25-26</a>, not only are the ants described as a people (&#8219;a&#770;m), but the locusts also; although it is said of them that they have no king. And &#8219;a&#770;m is synonymous with go&#772;i, which has indeed very frequently the idea of that which is hostile, and even here is used in this sense; though it by no means signifies a heathen nation, but occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-9.htm">Zephaniah 2:9</a> by the side of &#8219;a&#770;m, as an epithet applied to the people of Jehovah (i.e., Israel: see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-2.htm">Genesis 12:2</a>). The weapons of this army consist in its teeth, its "bite," which grinds in pieces as effectually as the teeth of the lion or the bite of the lioness (&#1502;&#1514;&#1500;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;; see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-17.htm">Job 29:17</a>). The suffix attached to &#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1497; does not refer to Jehovah, but to the prophet, who speaks in the name of the people, so that it is the land of the people of God. And this also applies to the suffixes in &#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-7.htm">Joel 1:7</a>. In the description of the devastation caused by the army of locusts, the vine and fig-tree are mentioned as the noblest productions of the land, which the Lord has given to His people for their inheritance (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-14.htm">Hosea 2:14</a>). &#1500;&#1511;&#1510;&#1508;&#1492;, &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;, literally, for crushing. The suffix in cha&#774;sa&#770;pha&#770;h refers, no doubt, simply to the vine as the principal object, the fig-tree being mentioned casually in connection with it. Cha&#770;saph, to strip, might be understood as referring simply to the leaves of the vine (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/29-9.htm">Psalm 29:9</a>); but what follows shows that the gnawing or eating away of the bark is also included. Hishl&#305;&#772;kh, to throw away not merely what is uneatable, "that which is not green and contains no sap" (Hitzig), but the vine itself, which the locusts have broken when eating off its leaves and bark. The branches of the vine have become white through the eating off of the bark (sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;g&#305;&#772;m, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/40-10.htm">Genesis 40:10</a>).<p>(Note: H. Ludolf, in his Histor. Aethiop. i. c. 13, 16, speaking of the locusts, says: "Neither herbs, nor shrubs, nor trees remain unhurt. Whatever is either grassy or covered with leaves, is injured, as if it had been burnt with fire. Even the bark of trees is nibbled with their teeth, so that the injury is not confined to one year alone.") </body></html>
