While they refuse to come to Christ and to seek mercy in and by him, that they may live, the fire of Divine wrath breaks forth upon them.

He speaks of all as past, and that, irremediably. Israel is one of the things which had been, and which would never again be. He calls her tenderly, "the virgin of Israel," not as having retained her purity or her fealty to God; still less, with human boastfulness, as though she had as yet been unsubdued by man. For she had been faithless to God, and had been many times conquered by man. Nor does it even seem that God so calls her, because He once espoused her to Himself For isaiah so calls Babylon. But Scripture seems to speak of cities, as women, because in women tenderness is most seen; they are most tenderly guarded; they, when pure, are most lovely; they, when corrupted, are most debased.<p>Hence , "God says on the one hand, "I remember thee, the love of thine espousals" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-2.htm">Jeremiah 2:2</a>; on the other, "Hear, thou harlot, the word of the Lord" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-35.htm">Ezekiel 16:35</a>. When He claims her faithfulness He calls her, betrothed." Again , "when He willeth to signify that a city or nation has been as tenderly loved and anxiously guarded, whether by Himsclf or by others, He calleth it "virgin," or when lie would indicate its beauty and lovely array. Isaiah saith, 'come down and sit in the dust, virgin daughter of Babylon' <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/47-1.htm">Isaiah 47:1</a>, that is, thou who livedest before in all delicacies, like a virgin under the shelter of her home. For it follows, 'for thou shalt no more be called tender and delicate.'" More pitiable, for their tenderness and delicacy, is the distress of women. And so he pictures her as already fallen, "dashed" (the word imitates the sound) to the earth "upon her own ground." An army may be lost, and the nation recover. She was "dashed down upon her own ground." In the abode of her strength, in the midst of her resources, in her innermost retreat, she should fall. In herself, she fell powerless. And he adds, she has "no one to raise her up;" none to have ruth upon her; image of the judgment on a lost soul, when the terrible sentence is spoken and none can intercede! "She shall not rise again." As she fell, she did not again rise. The prophet beholds beyond the eighty-five years which separated the prosperity under Jeroboam II from her captivity. As a people, he says, she should be restored no more; nor was she. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. virgin of Israel&#8212;the Israelite state heretofore unsubdued by foreigners.

The kingdom of Israel, so called, because it had never been subdued, or become subject to a foreign power, since it was a kingdom; or because, considered in its ecclesiastic state, it had been espoused to the Lord as a chaste virgin; and perhaps this may be ironically spoken, and refers to its present adulterate and degenerated state worshipping the calves at Dan and Bethel; or else because of its wealth and riches and the splendour and gaiety in which it appeared; but now, as it had fallen into sin and iniquity, it should quickly fall by it, and on account of it, into ruin and misery; and because of the certainty of it it is represented as if it was already fallen: <p>she shall no more rise; and become a kingdom again, as it never has as yet, since the ten tribes were carried away captive by Shalmaneser king of Assyria, to which calamity this prophecy refers, The Targum is, <p>"shall not rise again this year;'' <p>very impertinently; better Kimchi and Ben Melech, for a long time; since as they think, and many others, that the ten tribes shall return again, as may seem when all Israel shall be converted and saved, and repossess their own land; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/1-10.htm">Hosea 1:10</a>. Abendana produces a passage out of Zohar, in which these words are interpreted, that the virgin of Israel should not rise again of herself, she not having power to prevail over her enemies; but God will raise her up out of the dust, when he shall raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, who shall reign in future time over all the tribes together, as it is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-11.htm">Amos 9:11</a>; <p>she is forsaken upon her land; by her people, her princes, and her God; or prostrate on the ground, as the Targum; she was cast upon the ground, and dashed to pieces by the enemy as an earthen vessel, and there left, her ruin being irrecoverable; so whatever is cast and scattered, or dashed to pieces on the ground, and left, is expressed by the word here used, as Jarchi observes: <p>there is none to raise her up: her princes and people are either slain by the sword, famine, and pestilence, or carried captive, and so can yield her no assistance; her idols whom she worshipped cannot, and her God she forsook will not. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/amos/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is forsaken upon her land; <i>there is</i> none to raise her up.</span><p>(a) He so calls them, because they so boasted of themselves, or because they were given to lustfulness and daintiness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/amos/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">The virgin of Israel is fallen</span>, " <span class="ital">she shall no more rise;</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">She is</span> <span class="bld">cast down</span> <span class="ital">upon her land</span>, " there is <span class="ital">none to raise her up</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This is the ‘ḳînâh,’ written in a peculiar rhythm, which has been shewn (by Prof. K. Budde, now of Strassburg) to be that regularly used for Hebrew elegy. As a rule, in Hebrew poetry, the second of two parallel members balances the first, being approximately similar in length and structure, and presenting a thought either synonymous with it, or antithetic to it; but in the Hebrew elegy, the second member is shorter than the first, and instead of balancing and re-enforcing it, echoes it imperfectly, producing a plaintive, melancholy cadence. This rhythmical form prevails throughout most of the Book of ‘Lamentations,’ for instance, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-1.htm" title="The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.">Amos 1:1</a> :—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>How doth the city sit solitary, " she that was full of people!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>She is become as a widow, " she that was great among the nations;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The princess among the provinces, " she is become tributary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It is also observable elsewhere, where a ‘ḳînâh’ is announced, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-10.htm" title="For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled; they are gone.">Jeremiah 9:10</a> <span class="ital">b</span>–11:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the fowl of heaven even unto cattle, " they are fled, they are gone:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And I will make Jerusalem to be heaps, " an habitation of jackals;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And the cities of Judah will I make a desolation, " without inhabitant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the verses here quoted, each line, it will be observed, consists of two unequal parts, the second halting after the first, and being (in the Hebrew) appreciably shorter.

This is the earliest extant example of the personification of a nation, or community, as a woman,—a maiden or a mother, as the case may be: but it becomes common afterwards in Hebrew poetry, the figure being adopted especially with effect when it is desired to represent some keen or strong emotion, and being employed sometimes with great dramatic force.

"This throws thee into distress, that thou hast resisted me, who am thy help." &#1489;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1498;: as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-26.htm">Deuteronomy 33:26</a>, except that &#1489; is used in the sense of against, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/16-12.htm">Genesis 16:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/24-17.htm">2 Samuel 24:17</a>, etc. This opposition did not take place, however, when all Israel demanded a king of Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/8-5.htm">1 Samuel 8:5</a>). For although this desire is represented there (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-7.htm">Hosea 13:7</a>) as the rejection of Jehovah, Hosea is speaking here simply of the Israel of the ten tribes. The latter rebelled against Jehovah, when they fell away from the house of David, and made Jeroboam their king, and with contempt of Jehovah put their trust in the might of their kings of their own choosing (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-16.htm">1 Kings 12:16</a>.). But these kings could not afford them any true help. The question, "Where" ('eh&#305;&#772; only occurs here and twice in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, for &#1488;&#1497; or &#1488;&#1497;&#1492;, possibly simply from a dialectical variation - vid. Ewald, 104, c - and is strengthened by &#1488;&#1508;&#1493;&#1488;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/17-15.htm">Job 17:15</a>), "Where is thy king, that he may help thee?" does not presuppose that Israel had no king at all at that time, and that the kingdom was in a state of anarchy, but simply that it had no king who could save it, when the foe, the Assyrian, attacked it in all its cities. Before sho&#772;pheteykha&#770; (thy judges) we must repeat 'e&#774;h&#305;&#772; (where). The sho&#772;phet&#305;&#772;m, as the use of the word sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;m (princes) in its stead in the following clause clearly shows, are not simple judges, but royal counsellors and ministers, who managed the affairs of the kingdom along with the king, and superintended the administration of justice. The saying, "Give me a king and princes," reminds us very forcibly of the demand of the people in the time of Samuel; but they really refer simply to the desire of the ten tribes for a king of their own, which manifested itself in their dissatisfaction with the rule of the house of David, and their consequent secession, and to their persistence in this secession amidst all the subsequent changes of the government. We cannot therefore take the imperfects &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1503; and &#1488;&#1511;&#1468;&#1495; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-11.htm">Hosea 13:11</a> as pure preterites, i.e., we cannot understand them as referring simply to the choice of Jeroboam as king, and to his death. The imperfects denote an action that is repeated again and again, for which we should use the present, and refer to all the kings that the kingdom of the ten tribes had received and was receiving still, and to their removal. God in His wrath gives the sinful nation kings and takes them away, in order to punish the nation through its kings. This applies not merely to the kings who followed one another so rapidly through conspiracy and murder, although through these the kingdom was gradually broken up and its dissolution accelerated, but to the rulers of the ten tribes as a whole. God gave the tribes who were discontented with the theocratical government of David and Solomon a king of their own, that He might punish them for their resistance to His government, which came to light in the rebellion against Rehoboam. He suspended the division of the kingdom not only over Solomon, as a punishment for his idolatry, but also over the rebellious ten tribes, who, when they separated themselves from the royal house to which the promise had been given of everlasting duration, were also separated from the divinely appointed worship and altar, and given up into the power of their kings, who hurled one another from the throne; and God took away this government from them to chastise them for their sins, by giving them into the power of the heathen, and by driving them away from His face. It is to this last thought, that what follows is attached. The removal of the king in wrath would occur, because the sin of Ephraim was reserved for punishment. </body></html>
