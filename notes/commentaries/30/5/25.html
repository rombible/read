Some commentators would treat <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm" title="Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?">Amos 5:25</a> as a statement, and not a question, the first word being read as a definite article, and not an interrogative prefix in the Hebrew. But the construction of the following words forbids this supposition, and nearly all exegetes follow the LXX., Vulg., Targ., in taking the sentence as interrogative. Is the expected answer negative or affirmative? Heb. usage points to the former. So Ewald and Keil According to the latter, the words apply to the nation as a whole, or to the great mass of the people, individual exceptions being passed by. The following verse is then taken in an adversative sense, “To me ye have offered no sacrifices, but ye have borne,” &c. The opposition is between the Jehovah-worship, which they suspended, and the idol-worship which they carried on. This is a possible interpretation, as Driver (<span class= "ital">Heb. Tenses,</span> § 119a, foot-note) admits. But as that writer shows (<span class= "ital">l.c.</span>), it is more in consonance with grammatical usage to translate in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-26.htm" title="But you have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.">Amos 5:26</a> by a future, as Ewald does: “So ye shall carry away the tabernacle,” &c., <span class= "ital">i.e.,</span> when driven into exile. To this thought <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-27.htm" title="Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, said the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.">Amos 5:27</a> forms a natural development: <span class= "ital">And I will carry you away captive, &c.</span> Moreover, in the light of this interpretation the logical connection of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/5-21.htm" title="I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies.">Amos 5:21-27</a> becomes much simpler: “I, Jehovah, abhor the mechanical round of corrupt and hollow ceremonial cloaking wickedness of conduct. Live righteously. Did I exact punctilious discharge of ceremonial in the desert wanderings? [No.] Therefore I shall submit you once more to the discipline of exile wanderings.” On the meaning of the difficult clause, <span class= "ital">Chiun your images, the star of your god, which ye made for yourselves,</span> as well as on the rendering of the LXX. and St. Stephen’s quotation of the passage, see <span class= "ital">Excursus B.</span> Kuenen is scarcely justified in founding an argument on this passage as to the origin of the Sabbath.<p><span class= "bld">EXCURSUS B (Amos 5:26).</span><p>Three obscure points render this verse one of the most difficult in the Old Testament.<p>1. As to <span class= "ital">tense.</span> The interpretation to which preference has been given in the commentary on the text—the time being regarded as future—has been decided on grounds of grammatical usage only. But certainly the larger number of commentators have rendered the verb as <span class= "ital">a past</span> tense, “But ye bore the tabernacle,” &c., the time referred to being that of the desert wanderings. This view is upheld by Hitzig, Kuenen, Keil, Henderson, and also by R. S. Poole. It is also supported by the LXX.<p>2. The word <span class= "ital">Sikkûth,</span> rendered tabernacle, or tent, in the E.V. and by the LXX., is derived from a root signifying both to interweave and to cover—an etymology which confirms the above rendering. Ewald’s conjecture that it signifies “stake,” inferred from the Aramaic <span class= "ital">Sekkitho,</span> is to be rejected. The conception of Moloch being carried in a tent may be illustrated from the Egyptian monuments of Rameses XII. Birch (<span class= "ital">Egypt,</span> S. P. C. K., p. 149), refers to a tablet found in the south-west corner of Karnak: “The picture of the tablet represents Rameses holding a censer, and worshipping the ark of the god [Khons], which, partly covered with curtains, is placed in a boat . . . Figures of priests, a sphinx, and standards are in the boat, while twelve priests carry it on their shoulders.”<p>3. Both Moloch and Chiun were evidently star-deities. R. S. Poole endeavours to connect Chiun with Semitic deities worshipped in Egypt (see art. “Remphan,” Smith’s <span class= "ital">Dict. of the Bible</span>)<span class= "ital">.</span> The name Chiun appears as <span class= "ital">Remphan</span> in the quotation of this passage in Stephen’s speech (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm" title="Yes, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.">Acts 7:43</a>). And both Remphan and Chiun were held by Mr. Poole to be the corresponding male and female deities of Asiatic type, <span class= "ital">Renpu</span> and <span class= "ital">Ken.</span> But the form Remphan can be clearly shown to have arisen from textual corruption, originating, perhaps, in some false analogy. In the New Testament passage the best MSS. read <span class= "ital">Rephan,</span> and this reading has been adopted in our Revised Version, and occurs in nearly the same form in the LXX., from which Stephen was freely quoting. In the LXX. the original order of the clauses has suffered transposition, and it is certainly safer to adhere to the Hebrew text (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/9-11.htm" title="In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:">Amos 9:11-12</a>).<p><span class= "ital">Rêphan</span> arose from the Hebrew text by the change of a single character. Instances of such interchange are not infrequent in the Old Testament. Yet the form <span class= "ital">Rephan,</span> though corrupt, is invaluable, as indicating the true reading of the Hebrew word. The word for Chiun was read by the Masoretes as <span class= "ital">Kiyyûn</span> (according to Ewald, “pedestal” [?]). But the LXX. indicate, and much confirmatory testimony establishes the fact, that the word is to be read <span class= "ital">Kêvan,</span> and that Kêvan, like the Ammonitish Moloch, represented the <span class= "ital">star-deity Saturn.</span> Thus <span class= "ital">Kaivono</span> is the form of the word in the Peshito. This view is supported by Aben Ezra and Kimchi, who cite Kivan as the name for the star Saturn in the Persian and Arabic. This star (see quotations in Henderson’s <span class= "ital">Commentary</span>) was held to exert malignant influence. Schrader (<span class= "ital">Cuneiform Inscriptions and the Old Testament,</span> p. 443) compares the name <span class= "ital">Ka-ai-vanu,</span> the Assyrian name for that planet.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-25.htm" title="Have you offered to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?">Amos 5:25</a></span>. <span class="ital">Have ye offered — </span>Or, <span class="ital">did you offer, unto me sacrifices and offerings — </span>“Verborum emphasis in MIHI sita est,” says Spencer: The emphasis of the passage lies in ME. “Did ye offer such sacrifices as were acceptable to ME; such an entire and undivided service as I enjoin?” — Newcome. Certainly they did not. They offered sacrifices indeed, but in general did not offer them in a right manner, in a true spirit of piety; in the genuine fear and love of God, and with an upright intention to glorify him. On the contrary, they joined the worship of idols with the worship of God, and thereby polluted it, and rendered it insignificant in God’s sight. Thus Dr. Whitby: “This question is a strong negative, importing, that though they really did offer sacrifices, as he had commanded, yet he did not accept, or look upon them, as offered to him. The expression is like that of the Prophet <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-5.htm" title="Speak to all the people of the land, and to the priests, saying, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month, even those seventy years, did you at all fast to me, even to me?">Zechariah 7:5</a>, <span class="ital">When ye fasted, &c., did ye at all fast to me, even to me? </span>And this is here denied, 1st, Because God will accept of no worship as done unto him, which is not done unto him alone; and when any other is worshipped with him, he looks upon himself as not worshipped at all. So, of those nations which came from Assyria into the cities of Samaria, it is said, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-33.htm" title="They feared the LORD, and served their own gods, after the manner of the nations whom they carried away from there.">2 Kings 17:33</a>, <span class="ital">They feared the Lord, and served their own gods; </span>and then it is added, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-34.htm" title="To this day they do after the former manners: they fear not the LORD, neither do they after their statutes, or after their ordinances, or after the law and commandment which the LORD commanded the children of Jacob, whom he named Israel;">2 Kings 17:34</a>, <span class="ital">They feared not the Lord. </span>2d, Because God will not own any worship as performed to him, while men continue in their disobedience to his laws, and in their hearts depart from him. Thus the Jews, in Zechariah, are said not to <span class="ital">fast to him, </span>because they would not hearken to nor obey his words; and he is said to have been angry with them in the wilderness forty years, because <span class="ital">they erred from him in their hearts; </span>that is, says the Chaldee, <span class="ital">they had their idols in their hearts.”</span><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:18-27 Woe unto those that desire the day of the Lord's judgments, that wish for times of war and confusion; as some who long for changes, hoping to rise upon the ruins of their country! but this should be so great a desolation, that nobody could gain by it. The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Have ye offered - (better, "Did ye offer") unto Me sacrifices and offerings? Israel justified himself to himself by his half-service. This had been his way from the first. "Their heart was not whole with God, neither abode they in His covenant" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-37.htm">Psalm 78:37</a>. He thought to be accepted by God, because he did a certain homage to Him. He acknowledged God in his own way. God sets before him another instance of this half-service and what it issued in; the service of that generation which He brought out of Egypt, and which left their bones in the wilderness. The idolatry of the ten tribes was the revival of the idolatry of the wilderness. The ten tribes owned as the forefathers of their worship those first idolaters . They identified themselves with sin which they did not commit. By approving it and copying it, they made that sin their own. As the Church of God in all times is one and the same, and Hosea says of God's vision to Jacob, "there He spake with us" , so that great opposite camp, the city of the devil, has a continuous existence through all time. These idolaters were "filling up the measure of" their forefathers, and in the end of those forefathers, who perished in the wilderness where they sinned, they might behold their own. As God rejected the divided service of their forefathers, so He would their's.<p>God does not say that they did not offer sacrifice at all, but that they did not offer unto "Him." The "unto Me" is emphatic. If God is not served wholly and alone, He is not served at all. : "He regardeth not the offering, but the will of the offerer." Some sacrifices were offered during the 38 years and a half, after God had rejected that generation, and left them to die in the wilderness. For the rebellion of Korah and his company was a claim to exercise the priesthood, as Aaron was exercising it <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-5.htm">Numbers 16:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/16-9.htm">Numbers 16:9-10</a>. When atonement was to be made, the "live coals" were already on the altar <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/16-46.htm">Numbers 16:46</a>. These, however, were not the free-will offerings of the people, but the ordinance of God, performed by the priests. The people, in that they went after their idols, had no share in nor benefit from what was offered in their name. So Moses says, "they sacrificed to devils, not to God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-17.htm">Deuteronomy 32:17</a>; and Ezekiel, "Their heart went after their idols" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-16.htm">Ezekiel 20:16</a>.<p>Those were the gods of their affections, whom they chose. God had taken them for His people, and had become their God, on the condition that they should not associate other gods with Him <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-2.htm">Exodus 20:2-5</a>. Had they loved God who made them, they would have loved none beside Him. Since they chose other gods, these were the objects of their love. God was, at most, an object of their fear. As He said by Hosea, "their bread is for themselves, it shall not enter into the house of the Lord" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a>, so here He asks, and by asking denies it, "Did ye offer unto Me?" Idolatry and heresy feign a god of their own. They do not own God as He has revealed Himself; and since they own not God as He is, the god whom they worship, is not the true God, but some creature of their own imaginings, such as they conceive God to be. Anti-Trinitarianism denies to God His essential Being, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Other heresies refuse to own His awful holiness and justice; others, the depth of His love and condescension. Plainly, their god is not the one true God. So these idolaters, while they associated with God gods of cruelty and lust, and looked to them for things which God in His holiness and love refused them, did not own God, as the One Holy Creator, the Sole Disposer of all things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. Have ye offered? &c.&#8212;Yes: ye have. "But (all the time with strange inconsistency) ye have borne (aloft in solemn pomp) the tabernacle (that is, the portable shrine, or model tabernacle: small enough not to be detected by Moses; compare Ac 19:24) of your Molech" (that idol is "your" god; I am not, though ye go through the form of presenting offerings to Me). The question, "Have ye," is not a denial (for they did offer in the wilderness to Jehovah sacrifices of the cattle which they took with them in their nomad life there, Ex 24:4; Nu 7:1-89; 9:1, &c.), but a strong affirmation (compare 1Sa 2:27, 28; Jer 31:20; Eze 20:4). The sin of Israel in Amos' time is the very sin of their forefathers, mocking God with worship, while at the same time worshipping idols (compare Eze 20:39). It was clandestine in Moses' time, else he would have put it down; he was aware generally of their unfaithfulness, though not knowing the particulars (De 31:21, 27).<p>Molech &#8230; Chiun&#8212;"Molech" means "king" answering to Mars [Bengel]; the Sun [Jablonski]; Saturn, the same as "Chiun" [Maurer]. The Septuagint translates "Chiun" into Remphan, as Stephen quotes it (Ac 7:42, 43). The same god often had different names. Molech is the Ammonite name; Chiun, the Arabic and Persian name, written also Chevan. In an Arabic lexicon Chiun means "austere"; so astrologers represented Saturn as a planet baleful in his influence. Hence the Phœnicians offered human sacrifices to him, children especially; so idolatrous Israel also. Rimmon was the Syrian name (2Ki 5:18); pronounced as Remvan, or "Remphan," just as Chiun was also Chevan. Molech had the form of a king; Chevan, or Chiun, of a star [Grotius]. Remphan was the Egyptian name for Saturn: hence the Septuagint translator of Amos gave the Egyptian name for the Hebrew, being an Egyptian. [Hodius II, De Bibliorum Textibus Originalibus. 4.115]. The same as the Nile, of which the Egyptians made the star Saturn the representative [Harenberg]. Bengel considers Remphan or Rephan akin to Teraphim and Remphis, the name of a king of Egypt. The Hebrews became infected with Sabeanism, the oldest form of idolatry, the worship of the Saba or starry hosts, in their stay in the Arabian desert, where Job notices its prevalence (Job 31:26); in opposition, in Am 5:27, Jehovah declares Himself "the God of hosts."<p>the star of your god&#8212;R. Isaac Caro says all the astrologers represented Saturn as the star of Israel. Probably there was a figure of a star on the head of the image of the idol, to represent the planet Saturn; hence "images" correspond to "star" in the parallel clause. A star in hieroglyphics represents God (Nu 24:17). "Images" are either a Hebraism for "image," or refer to the many images made to represent Chiun.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Their fathers and they, though at so great distance of time, are one people, and so the prophet considers them in this place. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have ye offered?</span> did you not frequently omit to offer, and yet were not reproved or plagued for the omission, when your frequent removes, and many other difficulties, made it unpracticable? so little is sacrifice with your God! and yet, when you did offer, was it to me only? or did you not sacrifice to idols and false gods, and provoked me?

It is certain, too, that during the sojourn in the wilderness sacrificial worship fell greatly into desuetude, as we know that the rite of circumcision was suspended (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-5.htm">Joshua 5:5-7</a>), the Passover was not duly celebrated, and Joshua urged  the people to put away the strange gods from among them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-23.htm">Joshua 24:23</a>). Moses, too, doubtless with a view to existing practices, warns them against worshipping the heavenly bodies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), and offering sacrifice unto devils (<span class="accented">seirim</span>), "after whom they had gone a-whoring" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/17-7.htm">Leviticus 17:7</a>).

Hokhrath mincha&#770;h does not affirm that the offering of the daily morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>) - for it is to this that &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1498; chiefly, if not exclusively, refers - has already ceased; but simply that any further offering is rendered impossible by the failure of meal, wine, and oil. Now Israel could not suffer any greater calamity than the suspension of the daily sacrifice; for this was a practical suspension of the covenant relation - a sign that God had rejected His people. Therefore, even in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Romans, the sacrificial worship was not suspended till it had been brought to the last extremity; and even then it was for the want of sacrificers, and not of the material of sacrifice (Josephus, de bell. Jud. vi. 2, 1). The reason for this anxiety was the devastation of the field and land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>); and this is still further explained by a reference to the devastation and destruction of the fruits of the ground, viz., the corn, i.e., the corn growing in the field, so that the next harvest would be lost, and the new wine and oil, i.e., the vines and olive-trees, so that they could bear no grapes for new wine, and no olives for oil. The verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a> are not perfects, but imperatives, as in the fifth verse. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; has the same meaning as bo&#772;sh, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>, etc., to stand ashamed, to turn pale with shame at the disappointment of their hope, and is probably written defectively, without &#1493;, to distinguish it from &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the hiphil of &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, to be parched or dried up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>). The hope of the husbandmen was disappointed through the destruction of the wheat and barley, the most important field crops. The vine-growers had to mourn over the destruction of the vine and the choice fruit-trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>), such as the fig and pomegranate, and even the date-palm (gam-ta&#770;ma&#770;r), which has neither a fresh green rind nor tender juicy leaves, and therefore is not easily injured by the locusts so as to cause it to dry up; and tappu&#772;a&#774;ch, the apple-tree, and all the trees of the field, i.e., all the rest of the trees, wither. "All trees, whether fruit-bearing or not, are consumed by the devastating locusts" (Jerome). In the concluding clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>, the last and principal ground assigned for the lamentation is, that joy is taken away and withered from the children of men (ho&#772;bb&#305;&#772;sh min, constr. praegn.). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces a reason here as elsewhere, though not for the clause immediately preceding, but for the &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>, the leading thought in both verses; and we may therefore express it by an emphatic yea. </body></html>
