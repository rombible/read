The day of the Lord will be a dark, dismal, gloomy day to all impenitent sinners. When God makes a day dark, all the world cannot make it light. Those who are not reformed by the judgments of God, will be pursued by them; if they escape one, another stands ready to seize them. A pretence of piety is double iniquity, and so it will be found. The people of Israel copied the crimes of their forefathers. The law of worshipping the Lord our God, is, Him only we must serve. Professors thrive so little, because they have little or no communion with God in their duties. They were led captive by Satan into idolatry, therefore God caused them to go into captivity among idolaters.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye have borne - Literally, "And ye bare the tabernacle of your Moloch" (literally, "your king," from where the idol Moloch had its name.) He assigns the reason, why he had denied that they sacririced to God in the wilderness. "Did ye offer sacrifices unto Me, and ye bare?" that is, seeing that ye bare. The two were incompatible. Since they did "carry about the tabernacle of their king," they did not really worship God. He whom they chose as "their king," was their god. The "tabernacle" or "tent" was probably a little portable shrine, such as Demetrius the silversmith and those of his craft made for the little statues of their goddess Diana <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>. Such are mentioned in Egyptian idolatry. "They carry forth" we are told , "the image in a small shrine of gilt wood."<p>Of your Moloch and Chiun - The two clauses must be read separately, the "tabernacles of Moloch" (strictly, "of your king,") "and Chiun your images." The two clauses, "the tabernacle of your king, and Chiun your images," are altogether distinct. They correspond to one another, but they must not be read as one whole, in the sense, "the tabernacle of your king and of Chiun your images." The rendering of the last clause is uncertain. God has so "utterly abolished the idols" <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-18.htm">Isaiah 2:18</a>, through whom Satan contested with Him the allegiance of His people, that we have no certain knowledge, what they were. There may be some connection between the god whom the Israelites in the wilderness worshiped as "their king," and him whose worship Solomon, in his decay, brought into Jerusalem, the god whom the Ammonites worshiped as "the king, Hammolech," or, as he is once called, "Molech , and three times "Milchom" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-5.htm">1 Kings 11:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-33.htm">1 Kings 11:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-13.htm">2 Kings 23:13</a> (perhaps an abstract, as some used to speak of "the Deity"). He is mostly called "Hammolech," the Ammonite way of pronouncing what the Hebrews called "Hammelech, the king."<p>But since the name designates the god only as "the king," it may have been given to different gods, whom the pagan worshiped as their chief god. In Jewish idolatry, it became equivalent to Baal <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-35.htm">Jeremiah 32:35</a>, "lord;" and to avert his displeasure, the Hebrews (as did the Carthaginians, a Phoenician people, down to the time of our Lord ), burned their own children, "their sons and their daughters," alive to him. Yet, even in these dreadful rites, the Carthaginian worship  was more cold-blooded and artificial than that of Phoenicia. But whether "the king," whom the Israelites worshiped in the wilderness, was the same as the Ammonite Molech or no, those dreadful sacrifices were then no part of his worship; else Amos would not have spoken of the idolatry, "as the carrying about his tabernacle" only.<p>He would have described it by its greatest offensiveness. "The king" was a title also of the Egyptian Deity, Osiris , who was identified with the sun, and whose worship Israel may probably have brought with them, as well as that of the calf, his symbol. Again most of the old translators have retained the Hebrew word Chiyyan , either regarding it as a proper name, or unable to translate it. Some later tradition identities it with tire planet Saturn , which under a different name, the Arabs propitiated as a malevolent being . In Ephrem's time, the pagan Syrians worshiped "the child-devouring Chivan" .<p>Israel however, did not learn the idolatry from the neighboring Arabs, since it is not the Arab name of that planet . In Egyptian, the name of Chunsu, one of the 12 gods who severally were thought to preside over the 12 months, appears in an abridged form Chuns or Chon . He was, in their mythology, held to be "the oldest son of Ammon" ; "his name is said to signify , "power, might;" and he to be that ideal of might, worshiped as the Egyptian Hercules ."<p>Etymology M. See Sir G. Wilk. in Rawlinson, Herodotus, ii. 78. note. "The Egyptians called Hercules Chon." L. Girald (Opp. ii. 327) from Xenophon. Antioch. Drus. but the authority given is wrong). The name Chun extended into Phoenician  and Assyrian proper names. Still Chon is not Chiyyun; and the fact that the name was retained as Chon or Chun in Phoenicia (where the worship was borrowed) as well as in Assyria, is a ground for hesitating to identify with it the word of Chiyyun, which has a certain likeness only to the abridged name. Jerome's Hebrew teacher on the other hand knew of no such tradition, and Jerome renders it "image . And certainly it is most natural to render it not as a name, but as a common noun. It may probably mean, "the pedestal," the "basis of your images." The prophet had spoken of their images, as covered over with their little "shrines, the shrines of your king." Here he may, not improbably, speak of them, its fastened to a pedestal. Such were the gods, whom they chose for the One true God, gods, "carried about," covered over, fixed to their place, lest they should fall.<p>The worship was certainly some form of star-worship, since there follows, "the star of your god." It took place after the worship of the calf. For Stephen, after having spoken of that idolatry says, "Then God turned and gave them up to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets" <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>. Upon their rebellions, God at last gave them up to themselves. Stephen calls the god whom they worshiped, "Rephan," quoting the then existing Greek translation, "having regard," Jerome says, "to the meaning rather than the words. This is to be observed in all Holy Scripture, that Apostles and apostolic men, in citing testimonies from the Old Testament, regard, not the words, but the meaning, nor do they follow the words, step by step, provided they do not depart from the meaning."<p>Of the special idolatry there is no mention in Moses, in like way as the mention of the worship of the "goat , a second symbol of the Pantheistic worship of Egypt , is contained only incidentally in the prohibition of that worship. After the final rebellion, upon which God rejected that generation, Holy Scripture takes no account of them. They had failed God; they had forfeited the distinction, for which God had created, preserved, taught them, revealed Himself to them, and had, by great miracles, rescued them from Egypt. Thenceforth, that generation was cast aside unnoticed.<p>Which ye made to yourselves - This was the fundamental fault, that they "made it for themselves." Instead of the tabernacle, which God, their king, appointed, they "bare about the tabernacle" of him whom they took for their king; and for the service which He gave, they "chose new gods" <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-8.htm">Judges 5:8</a> for themselves. Whereas God made them for Himself, they made for themselves gods out of their own mind. All idolatry is self will, first choosing a god, and then enslaved to it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>25, 26. Have ye offered? &c.&#8212;Yes: ye have. "But (all the time with strange inconsistency) ye have borne (aloft in solemn pomp) the tabernacle (that is, the portable shrine, or model tabernacle: small enough not to be detected by Moses; compare Ac 19:24) of your Molech" (that idol is "your" god; I am not, though ye go through the form of presenting offerings to Me). The question, "Have ye," is not a denial (for they did offer in the wilderness to Jehovah sacrifices of the cattle which they took with them in their nomad life there, Ex 24:4; Nu 7:1-89; 9:1, &c.), but a strong affirmation (compare 1Sa 2:27, 28; Jer 31:20; Eze 20:4). The sin of Israel in Amos' time is the very sin of their forefathers, mocking God with worship, while at the same time worshipping idols (compare Eze 20:39). It was clandestine in Moses' time, else he would have put it down; he was aware generally of their unfaithfulness, though not knowing the particulars (De 31:21, 27).<p>Molech &#8230; Chiun&#8212;"Molech" means "king" answering to Mars [Bengel]; the Sun [Jablonski]; Saturn, the same as "Chiun" [Maurer]. The Septuagint translates "Chiun" into Remphan, as Stephen quotes it (Ac 7:42, 43). The same god often had different names. Molech is the Ammonite name; Chiun, the Arabic and Persian name, written also Chevan. In an Arabic lexicon Chiun means "austere"; so astrologers represented Saturn as a planet baleful in his influence. Hence the Phœnicians offered human sacrifices to him, children especially; so idolatrous Israel also. Rimmon was the Syrian name (2Ki 5:18); pronounced as Remvan, or "Remphan," just as Chiun was also Chevan. Molech had the form of a king; Chevan, or Chiun, of a star [Grotius]. Remphan was the Egyptian name for Saturn: hence the Septuagint translator of Amos gave the Egyptian name for the Hebrew, being an Egyptian. [Hodius II, De Bibliorum Textibus Originalibus. 4.115]. The same as the Nile, of which the Egyptians made the star Saturn the representative [Harenberg]. Bengel considers Remphan or Rephan akin to Teraphim and Remphis, the name of a king of Egypt. The Hebrews became infected with Sabeanism, the oldest form of idolatry, the worship of the Saba or starry hosts, in their stay in the Arabian desert, where Job notices its prevalence (Job 31:26); in opposition, in Am 5:27, Jehovah declares Himself "the God of hosts."<p>the star of your god&#8212;R. Isaac Caro says all the astrologers represented Saturn as the star of Israel. Probably there was a figure of a star on the head of the image of the idol, to represent the planet Saturn; hence "images" correspond to "star" in the parallel clause. A star in hieroglyphics represents God (Nu 24:17). "Images" are either a Hebraism for "image," or refer to the many images made to represent Chiun.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But ye, </span> the idolatrous children of idolatrous fathers, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">have borne, </span> carried along with you in the wilderness, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">the tabernacle, </span> or little chapel, or shrine, or canopy, in which the image of their idol was placed.

The god of the Ammonites; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13</a>; and See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-31.htm">Jeremiah 7:31</a>; called theirs, because they also worshipped it, and caused their seed to pass through the fire to it; and which was carried by them in a shrine, or portable tent or chapel. Or it may be rendered, "but ye have borne Siccuth your king" (p); and so Siccuth may be taken for the name of an idol, as it is by Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech, to whom they gave the title of king, as another idol went by the name of the queen of heaven; perhaps by one was meant the sun, and by the other the moon; <p>and Chiun, your images; Mo or Siccuth was one, and Chiun another image, or rather the same; and this the same with Chevan, which in the Arabic and Persic languages is the name of Saturn, as Aben Ezra and Kimchi say; and is so rendered by Montanus here; and who in the Egyptian tongue was called Revan, or Rephan, or Remphan; as by the Septuagint here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>; <p>the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves; or the star "your god" (q); meaning the same with Chiun or Saturn; perhaps the same with the star that fell from the air or sky, mentioned by Sanchoniatho (r); which Astarte, the wife of Chronus or Saturn, is said to take and consecrate in Tyre; this they made for themselves, and worshipped as a deity. The Targum is, <p>"ye have borne the tabernacle of your priests, Chiun your image, the star your God, which ye have made to yourselves.'' <p>Various are the senses put upon the word Chiun. Some read it Cavan, and take it to signify a "cake"; in which sense the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-18.htm">Jeremiah 7:18</a>; and render it, "the cake of your images" (s); and supposing that it had the image of their gods impressed upon it. Calmet interprets it "the pedestal of your images" (t); and indeed the word has the signification of a basis, and is so rendered by some (u); and is applicable to Mo their king, a king being the basis and foundation of the kingdom and people; and to the sun, intended by that deity, which is the basis of the celestial bodies, and of all things on earth. Some take Mo and Chiun to be distinct deities, the one to be the sun, the other the moon; but they seem rather to be the same, and both to be the Egyptian ox, and the calf of the Israelites in the wilderness, the image of which was carried in portable tents or tabernacles, in chests or shrines; such as the Succothbenoth, or tabernacles of Venus, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-30.htm">2 Kings 17:30</a>; and those of Diana's, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a>; the first of these portable temples we read of, is one drawn by oxen in Phoenicia, mentioned by Sanchoniatho (w); not that the Israelites carried such a tent or tabernacle during their travels through the wilderness, whatever they might do the few days they worshipped the calf; but this is to be understood of their posterity in later times, in the times of Amos; and also when Shalmaneser carried them captive beyond Damascus, as follows. It may be further observed, for the confirmation and illustration of what has been said concerning Chiun, that the Egyptian Anubis, which Plutarch (x) says is the same with Saturn, is called by him Kyon, which seems to be no other than this word Chiun: and whereas Stephen calls it Rephan, this is not a corruption of the word, reading Rephan or Revan for Chevan; nor has he respect to Rimmon, the god of the Syrians, but it is the Egyptian name for Saturn; which the Septuagint interpreters might choose to make use of, they interpreting for the king of Egypt: and Diodorus Siculus (y) makes mention of an Egyptian king called Remphis, whom Braunius (z) takes to be this very Chiun; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>; but Rephas, or Rephan, was the same with Chronus, or Saturn, from whence came the Rephaim (a), who dwelt in Ashtaroth Karnaim, a town of Ham or Chronus; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-5.htm">Genesis 14:5</a>. Some (b), who take Siccuth for an idol, render it in the future, "ye shall carry", &amp;c. and take it to be a prediction of Amos, that the Israelites should, with great reproach and ignominy, be obliged by the Assyrians, as they were led captive, to carry on their shoulders the idols they had worshipped, and in vain had trusted in, as used to be done in triumphs; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-15.htm">Amos 1:15</a>. <p>(p)  "Siccuth regem vestrum", Munster, Montanus, Vatablus, Calvin, Mercerus.

Gesch</span>. p. 528 f.; Sayce, <span class="ital">Hibbert Lectures</span>, pp. 7, 151–154. <span class="ital">Chiun</span> (R.V.) should in all probability be pointed <span class="ital">Kêwân</span> or <span class="ital">Kaiwân</span>; it will then be identical with the Assyrian name of the planet Saturn, <span class="ital">Ka-ai-va-nu</span> (whence also <span class="ital">Kêwân</span> and <span class="ital">Kaiwân</span>, the Syriac, Persian, and Arabic names of the same planet[163]): so the Pesh., Ibn Ezra, Schrader, and many other moderns. The middle part of the verse does not, however, seem to be altogether in order; <span class="ital">images</span> (in the plural), for instance, being strange as applied to Kaiwân alone; and perhaps we should either (with Schrader) transpose two groups of words, and read “Sakkuth your king, and Kaiwân your star-god, the images which ye made” &c., or (with Wellhausen) omit <span class="greekheb">צלמיכם</span>, “your images,” and <span class="greekheb">כוכב</span>, “the star of” (or “star”), as glosses on <span class="greekheb">אלהיכם</span>, “your god” and <span class="greekheb">כיון</span>, “Kaiwân,” respectively. The reference must be to star-worship introduced into Israel from Assyria: cf., somewhat later, in Judah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm" title="And lest you lift up your eyes to heaven, and when you see the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host of heaven, should be driven to worship them, and serve them, which the LORD your God has divided to all nations under the whole heaven.">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm" title="And has gone and served other gods, and worshipped them, either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I have not commanded;">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-12.htm" title="And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.">2 Kings 23:12</a> &c.[164] The context appears to shew, as W.

These scholars agree indeed that the verse cannot refer to idolatry in the past, but object, for instance (Wellh.), that the idols of a vanquished nation would be carried off as trophies by the victors (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/46-1.htm" title="Bel bows down, Nebo stoops, their idols were on the beasts, and on the cattle: your carriages were heavy laden; they are a burden to the weary beast.">Isaiah 46:1</a>), rather than taken into exile by the vanquished themselves, and point out that the fault with which elsewhere Amos reproaches the people is an exaggerated ceremonialism in the worship of Jehovah, not devotion to other gods. There is no doubt force in these objections; but it may be doubted whether our knowledge of the times is such as to render them conclusive; nor has any preferable explanation been yet proposed. Cf. Wellh., p. 83; G. A. Smith, p. 172 f.; N. Schmidt, <span class="ital">Journ. of Bibl.

The Israelites, like men in many other ages, were sufficiently ready to conform to the external forms and offices of religion, while heedless of its spiritual precepts, and especially of the claim which it makes to regulate their conduct and their lives; and the prophets again and again take occasion to point out to them their mistake, and to recall to them the true nature of spiritual religion.

The connection with the context, the meaning of some of the terms, and whether the reference is to past, present, or future, are questions which have roused much controversy. We need not here recapitulate the various opinions which have been held. It will be sufficient to state what seems to be the simplest and most probable explanation of the passage. But we must not omit to mention first the explanation adopted by Ewald, Schrader, Farrar, Konig, and others, viz. that this verse refers to the punitive deportation which was to be the people's lot, when they should take their shrines and images with them into captivity. "So shall ye take (into exile) Sakkuth your king," etc. But the punishment is foretold in ver. 27; and this verse contrasts their idol worship with the neglected worship of Jehovah (ver. 25). <span class="cmt_word">But ye have borne;</span> <span class="accented">and ye bare</span>; <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span> (Septuagint); <span class="accented">et</span> <span class="accented">portastis</span> (Vulgate).

The Hebrew word rendered "tabernacle" (<span class="accented">sikkuth</span>). which is found nowhere else, has been variously explained. Aquila gives <span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x1f7b;&#x3c2;</span>: Theodotion, "vision," reading the whole sentence thus: <span class="greek">&#x39a;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x1f24;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>. Many moderns render, "stake," "column," or "shrine." Others suppose it to be equivalent to <span class="accented">Sakkuth</span>, an Assyrian name for Molech (or Adar); but this is very uncertain (see 'Studien und Kritiken.' 1874, p. 887), sad the parallelism requires the word to be an appellative and not a proper name. It most probably means "shrine," a portable shrine, like those spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/19-24.htm">Acts 19:24</a> in connection with the worship of Diana. The Syriac and Arabic versions call it "tent," and thus the reproach stands forth emphatically that, instead of, or in conjunction with, the true tabernacle, they bore aloft, as if proud of their apostasy, the tabernacle of a false god. Such shrines were used by the Egyptians, according to Herodotus (2:63, where see Rawlinson's note) and Diod. Sic. (1:97). Many such may be seen in the Egyptian room of the British Museum. Keil quotes Drumann, 'On the Rosetta Inscription,' p. 211, "These were small chapels, generally gilded and ornamented with flowers and in other ways, intended to hold a small idol when processions were made, and to be carried or driven about with it." Hence we must look to Egypt as the source of this idolatry. <span class="cmt_word">Moloch</span>, though sanctioned by the LXX. and St. Stephen (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-43.htm">Acts 7:43</a>), is a mistranslation. De Rossi, indeed, mentions that one Hebrew manuscript gives <span class="accented">Moloch</span>, but the received reading is <span class="accented">Melkekem</span>, which is confirmed by Symmachus and Theodotion, who have <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span>, and by the Syriac. The translation, therefore, should run, "Ye took up the shrine of your king," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of him whom ye made your king in the place of Jehovah, meaning some stellar divinity. <span class="cmt_word">And Chiun your images;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x1f51;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1fec;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3c6;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;</span>, "and the star of your god Raephan "(Septuagint); <span class="accented">et imaginem idolorum vestrorum</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the kiyyun of your images.</span> The parallelism again requires us to take this unknown word as an appellative; and according to its probable derivation, its meaning is "pedestal," or "framework," that on which the image stood. The Greek rendering is, as Keil thinks, owing to a false reading of the unpointed text, in old Hebrew <span class="accented">kaph</span> and <span class="accented">resh</span> being easily confounded, and <span class="accented">vau</span> and <span class="accented">pe</span>. Theodotion considered the word a common noun, translating it by <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>. It is probably a mere coincidence that in some Assyrian inscriptions the name <span class="accented">Kairan</span> occurs as that of a deity, who is identified with Saturn; that the Egyptians (from whom the Israelites must have derived the notion) ever acknowledged such a deity is quite unproved. St. Stephen merely quotes the <span class="accented">Textus Receptus</span> of his day, which was close enough to the original for his argument. <span class="cmt_word">The star of your god.</span> These words are in loose apposition with the preceding, and are equivalent to "your star god," or the star whom ye worship as god. Whether some particular star is meant, or whether the sun is the deity signified, cannot be determined, although the universal prevalence of the worship of sun gods in Egypt makes the latter supposition very probable.  St. Stephen puts the sin in a general form: "God gave them up to serve the host of heaven" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-42.htm">Acts 7:42</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/17-3.htm">Deuteronomy 17:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Which ye made to yourselves.</span> This was the crime, self-will, desertion of the appointed way for devices of their own invention. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/joel/1.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The whole nation is to mourn over this devastation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>. "Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>. The meat-offering and the drink-offering are destroyed from the house of Jehovah. The priests, the servant of Jehovah. mourn. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>.

Turn pale, ye husbandmen; howl, ye vinedressers, over wheat and barley: for the harvest of the field is perished. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>. The vine is spoiled, and the fig-tree faded; the pomegranate, also the palm and the apple tree: all the trees of the field are withered away; yea, joy has expired from the children of men." In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a> Judah is addressed as the congregation of Jehovah. &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; is the imperative of the verb &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;, equivalent to the Syriac 'ela&#772;', to lament. The verb only occurs here. The lamentation of the virgin for the &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500; &#1504;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492;, i.e., the beloved of your youth, her bridegroom, whom she has lost by death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-6.htm">Isaiah 54:6</a>), is the deepest and bitterest lamentation. With reference to &#1495;&#1490;&#1512;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, see Delitzsch on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. The occasion of this deep lamentation, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>, is the destruction of the meat-offering and drink-offering from the house of the Lord, over which the servants of Jehovah mourn. The meat and drink offerings must of necessity cease, because the corn, the new wine, and the oil are destroyed through the devastation of the field and soil. Hokhrath mincha&#770;h does not affirm that the offering of the daily morning and evening sacrifice (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/29-38.htm">Exodus 29:38-42</a>) - for it is to this that &#1502;&#1504;&#1495;&#1492; &#1493;&#1504;&#1505;&#1498; chiefly, if not exclusively, refers - has already ceased; but simply that any further offering is rendered impossible by the failure of meal, wine, and oil. Now Israel could not suffer any greater calamity than the suspension of the daily sacrifice; for this was a practical suspension of the covenant relation - a sign that God had rejected His people. Therefore, even in the last siege of Jerusalem by the Romans, the sacrificial worship was not suspended till it had been brought to the last extremity; and even then it was for the want of sacrificers, and not of the material of sacrifice (Josephus, de bell. Jud. vi. 2, 1). The reason for this anxiety was the devastation of the field and land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a>); and this is still further explained by a reference to the devastation and destruction of the fruits of the ground, viz., the corn, i.e., the corn growing in the field, so that the next harvest would be lost, and the new wine and oil, i.e., the vines and olive-trees, so that they could bear no grapes for new wine, and no olives for oil. The verbs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a> are not perfects, but imperatives, as in the fifth verse. &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; has the same meaning as bo&#772;sh, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-26.htm">Jeremiah 2:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>, etc., to stand ashamed, to turn pale with shame at the disappointment of their hope, and is probably written defectively, without &#1493;, to distinguish it from &#1492;&#1493;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, the hiphil of &#1497;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;, to be parched or dried up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-10.htm">Joel 1:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>). The hope of the husbandmen was disappointed through the destruction of the wheat and barley, the most important field crops. The vine-growers had to mourn over the destruction of the vine and the choice fruit-trees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>), such as the fig and pomegranate, and even the date-palm (gam-ta&#770;ma&#770;r), which has neither a fresh green rind nor tender juicy leaves, and therefore is not easily injured by the locusts so as to cause it to dry up; and tappu&#772;a&#774;ch, the apple-tree, and all the trees of the field, i.e., all the rest of the trees, wither. "All trees, whether fruit-bearing or not, are consumed by the devastating locusts" (Jerome). In the concluding clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-12.htm">Joel 1:12</a>, the last and principal ground assigned for the lamentation is, that joy is taken away and withered from the children of men (ho&#772;bb&#305;&#772;sh min, constr. praegn.). &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; introduces a reason here as elsewhere, though not for the clause immediately preceding, but for the &#1492;&#1489;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468; and &#1492;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-11.htm">Joel 1:11</a>, the leading thought in both verses; and we may therefore express it by an emphatic yea. </body></html>
