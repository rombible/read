"Out of the hand of hell will I redeem them; from death will I set them free! Where are thy plagues, O death? where thy destruction, O hell! Repentance is hidden from mine eyes." The fact that this verse contains a promise, and not a threat, would hardly have been overlooked by so many commentators, if they had not been led, out of regard to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-13.htm">Hosea 13:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-15.htm">Hosea 13:15</a>, to put force upon the words, and either take the first clauses as interrogative, "Should I ... redeem?" (Calvin and others), or as conditional, "I would redeem them," with "si resipiscerent" (supplied (Kimchi, Sal. b. Mel. Ros., etc.). But apart from the fact that the words supplied are perfectly arbitrary, with nothing at all to indicate them, both of these explanations are precluded by the sentences which follow: for the questions, "Where are thy plagues, O death?" etc., are obviously meant to affirm the conquest or destruction of hell and death. And this argument retains its force even if we take &#1488;&#1492;&#1497; as an optative from &#1492;&#1497;&#1492;, without regard to <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-10.htm">Hosea 13:10</a>, since the thought, "I should like to be thy plague, O death," presupposes that deliverance from the power of death is affirmed in what comes before. But, on account of the style of address, we cannot take &#1488;&#1492;&#1497; even as an interrogative, in the sense of "Should I be," etc. And what would be the object of this gradation of thought, if the redemption from death were only hypothetical, or were represented as altogether questionable? If we take the words as they stand, therefore, it is evident that they affirm something more than deliverance when life is in danger, or preservation from death. To redeem or ransom from the hand (or power) of hell, i.e., of the under world, the realm of death, is equivalent to depriving hell of its prey, not only by not suffering the living to die, but by bringing back to life those who have fallen victims to hell, i.e., to the region of the dead. The cessation or annihilation of death is expressed still more forcibly in the triumphant words: "Where are thy plagues (pestilences), O death? where thy destruction, O hell?" of which Theodoret has aptly observed, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;. &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1497;&#1498; is an intensive plural of debher, plague, pestilence, and is to be explained in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/91-6.htm">Psalm 91:6</a>, where we also find the synonym &#1511;&#1496;&#1489; in the form &#1511;&#1496;&#1489;, pestilence or destruction. The Apostle Paul has therefore very properly quoted these words in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-55.htm">1 Corinthians 15:55</a>, in combination with the declaration in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>, "Death is swallowed up in victory," to confirm the truth, that at the resurrection of the last day, death will be annihilated, and that which is corruptible changed into immortality. We must not restrict the substance of this promise, however, to the ultimate issue of the redemption, in which it will receive its complete fulfilment. The suffixes attached to 'ephde&#772;m and 'eg'a&#770;le&#772;m point to Israel of the ten tribes, like the verbal suffixes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/25-8.htm">Isaiah 25:8</a>. Consequently the promised redemption from death must stand in intimate connection with the threatened destruction of the kingdom of Israel. Moreover, the idea of the resurrection of the dead was by no means so clearly comprehended in Israel at that time, as that the prophet could point believers to it as a ground of consolation when the kingdom was destroyed. The only meaning that the promise had for the Israelites of the prophet's day, was that the Lord possessed the power even to redeem from death, and raise Israel from destruction into newness of life; just as Ezekiel (ch. 37) depicts the restoration of Israel as the giving of life to the dry bones that lay scattered about the field. The full and deeper meaning of these words was but gradually unfolded to believers under the Old Testament, and only attained complete and absolute certainty for all believers through the actual resurrection of Christ. But in order to anticipate all doubt as to this exceedingly great promise, the Lord adds, "repentance is hidden from mine eyes," i.e., my purpose of salvation will be irrevocably accomplished. The &#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. no&#772;cham does not mean "resentment" (Ewald), but, as a derivative of nicham, simply consolation or repentance. The former, which the Septuagint adopts, does not suit the context, which the latter alone does. The words are to be interpreted in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/110-4.htm">Psalm 110:4</a>, where the oath of God is still further strengthened by the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1501;, "and will not repent;" and &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1501; corresponds to &#1488;&#1501; &#1488;&#1499;&#1494;&#1468;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-36.htm">Psalm 89:36</a> (Marck and Krabbe, Quaestion. de Hos. vatic. spec. p. 47).
