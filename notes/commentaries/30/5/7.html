So this was a dispensation of providence, which it was very suitable for one of Amos’s profession to mention. “But in Arabia and the neighbouring countries, to this present day, not only the shepherds, but the men in general, the women and children, know the names of the stars. Sanctius assures us, that the shepherds in Spain know perfectly well the stars of Ursa Major, Orion, the Pleiades, &c., and that they generally measure the time of night by the course of these stars.” — Dodd. <span class="ital">And turneth the shadow of death into the morning — </span>The greatest adversity into as great prosperity; <span class="ital">and maketh the day dark with night — </span>Changes prosperity into adversity: <span class="ital">that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them upon the earth — </span>Who commandeth the seas and the rivers to overflow the earth in great inundations; or rather, commands the vapours to ascend from the sea, turns them into rain, and then pours it from the clouds, to render the earth fruitful. <span class="ital">That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong — </span>Who giveth strength to him that hath been conquered and spoiled, and enables him to subdue his conquerors, and become master even of the strongest places.

Moses had used "gall" and "wormwood" as a proverb; "lest there be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood; the Lord will not spare him, but then the anger of the Lord and His jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him" <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-20.htm">Deuteronomy 29:20</a>. The word of Amos would remind them of the word of Moses.<p>And leave off righteousness in the earth - Better, "and set righteousness to rest on the ground" . They dethroned righteousness, the representative and vice-gerent of God, and made it rest on the ground. The "little horn," Daniel says, should "cast truth to the ground" <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>. These seem to have blended outrage with insult, as when "the Lord our Righteousness" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-6.htm">Jeremiah 23:6</a> took our flesh, "they put on Him" the "scarlet robe, and the crown of thorns" upon His Head, and bowed the knee before Him, and mocked Him," and then "crucified Him." They "deposed" her, "set her down," it may be, with a mock make-believe deference, as people now-a-days, in civil terms, depose God, ignoring Him and His right over them. They set her on the ground and so left her, the image of God. This they did, not in one way only, but in all the ways in which they could. He does not limit it to the "righteousness" shown in doing justice. It includes all transactions between man and man, in which right enters, all buying and selling, all equity, all giving to another his due. All the bands of society were dissolved, and righteousness was placed on the ground, to be trampled on by all in all things. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. turn judgment to wormwood&#8212;that is, pervert it to most bitter wrong.

It would sound in people's ears as a reminiscence of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-18.htm">Deuteronomy 29:18, 20</a>. The LXX. reads, <span class="greek">&#x1f41;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f55;&#x3c8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;</span>.

The name "wormwood" is applied to all the plants of the genus that grow in Palestine the taste of which was proverbially bitter. <span class="cmt_word">And leave off righteousness in the earth;</span> rather, <span class="accented">cast</span> <span class="accented">down righteousness to the earth</span> (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-2.htm">Isaiah 28:2</a>), despise it and trample it underfoot (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-12.htm">Daniel 8:12</a>). This is Israel's practice; and yet God, as the next verse shows, is almighty, and has power to punish. <span class="accented">Righteousness</span> includes all transactions between man and man.

East wind will come, a wind of Jehovah, rising up from the desert; and his fountain will dry up, and his spring become dried. He plunders the treasuries of all splendid vessels." The connection between the first clause and the previous verse has been correctly pointed out by Marck. "Hos 13:15," he says, "adduces a reason to prove that the promised grace of redemption would certainly stand firm." &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; cannot be either a particle of time or of condition here (when, or if); for neither of them yields a suitable thought, since Ephraim neither was at that time, nor could become, fruit-bearing among brethren. Ewald's hypothetical view, "Should Ephraim be a fruitful child," cannot be grammatically sustained, since k&#305;&#772; is only used in cases where a circumstance is assumed to be real. For one that is merely supposed to be possible, &#1488;&#1501; is required, as the interchange of &#1488;&#1501; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/5-19.htm">Numbers 5:19-20</a>, for example, clearly shows. The meaning of &#1497;&#1508;&#1512;&#1497;&#1488; is placed beyond all doubt by the evident play upon the name Ephraim; and this also explains the writing with &#1488; instead of &#1492; fo d, as well as the idea of the sentence itself: Ephraim will bear fruit among the brethren, i.e., the other tribes, as its name, double-fruitfulness, affirms (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-52.htm">Genesis 41:52</a>). This thought, through which the redemption from death set before Israel is confirmed, is founded not only upon the assumption that the name must become a truth, but chiefly upon the blessing which the patriarch promised to the tribe of Ephraim on the ground of its name, both in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-4.htm">Genesis 48:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/48-20.htm">Genesis 48:20</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-22.htm">Genesis 49:22</a>. Because Ephraim possessed such a pledge of blessing in its very name, the Lord would not let it be overwhelmed for ever in the tempest that was bursting upon it. The same thing applies to the name Ephraim as to the name Israel, with which it is used as synonymous; and what is true of all the promises of God is true of this announcement also, viz., that they are only fulfilled in the case of those who adhere to the conditions under which they were given. Of Ephraim, those only will bear fruit which abides to everlasting life, who walk as true champions for God in the footsteps of faith and of their forefathers, wrestling for the blessing of the promises. On the other hand, upon the Ephraim that has turned into Canaan (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-8.htm">Hosea 12:8</a>) an east wind will come, a tempest bursting from the desert (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a>), and that a stormy wind raised by Jehovah, which will dry up his spring, i.e., destroy not only the fruitful land with which God has blessed it (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-13.htm">Deuteronomy 33:13-16</a>), but all the sources of its power and stability. Like the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/13-14.htm">Hosea 13:14</a>, the threatening of the judgment, to which the kingdom of Israel is to succumb, is introduced quite abruptly with the word &#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;. The figurative style of address then passes in the last clause into a literal threat. &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, he, the hostile conqueror, sent as a tempestuous wind by the Lord, viz., the Assyrian, will plunder the treasure of all costly vessels, i.e., all the treasures and valuables of the kingdom. On kel&#305;&#772; chemda&#770;h compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-10.htm">Nahum 2:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>. We understand by it chiefly the treasures of the capital, to which a serious catastrophe is more especially predicted in the next verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-1.htm">Hosea 14:1</a>), which also belongs to this strophe, on account of its rebellion against God. </body></html>
