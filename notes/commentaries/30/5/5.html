Amos sets the two seeking, as incompatible. The god, worshiped at Bethel, was not the One God. To seek God there was to lose Him. "Seek not God," he would say, "and a phantom, which will lead from God."<p>And pass not to Beersheba - Jeroboam I pretended that it was too much for Israel to go up to Jerusalem. And Yet Israel thought it not too much to go to the extremest point of Judah toward Idumaea , perhaps, four times as far south of Jerusalem, as Jerusalem lay from Bethel. For Beersheba is thought to have lain some thirty miles south of Hebron , which is twenty-two miles south of Jerusalem ; while Bethel is but twelve to the north. So much pains will people take in self-willed service, and yet not see that it takes away the excuse for neglecting the true. At Beersheba, Abraham "called upon the name of the Lord, the everlasting God" <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/21-33.htm">Genesis 21:33</a>. There God revealed Himself to Isaac and Jacob <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/26-23.htm">Genesis 26:23-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/46-1.htm">Genesis 46:1</a>. There, because He had so revealed Himself, Judah made a place of idolatry, which Israel, seeking nought besides from Judah, sought. Beersheba was still a town  or large village  in the time of Jerome. Now all is swept away, except  "some foundations of ruins," spread over 34 of a mile, "with scarcely one stone upon another" . The wells alone remain , with the ancient names.<p>Gilgal shall surely go into captivity - The verbal allusions in the prophets are sometimes artificial; sometimes, they develop the meaning of the word itself, as when Zephaniah says, "Ekron (probably the "firm-rooting") "shall be uprooted" <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-4.htm">Zephaniah 2:4</a>; sometimes, as here, the words are connected, although not the same. In all cases, the likeness of sound was calculated to fix them in men's memories. It would be so, if one with authority could say, "Paris perira" , "Paris shall perish" or "London is undone." Still more would the words, Hag-gilgal galo yigleh, because the name Gilgal still retained its first meaning, "the great rolling , and the word joined with it had a kindred meaning. Originally it probably means, "swept clear away." God first "rolled away the reproaeh of Egypt" <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/5-9.htm">Joshua 5:9</a> from His people there. Then, when it made itself like the pagan, it should itself be rolled clear away <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-25.htm">Jeremiah 51:25</a>. Gilgal was originally in Benjamin, but Israel had probably annexed it to itself, as it had Bethel and Jericho <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-34.htm">1 Kings 16:34</a>, both of which had been assigned by Joshua to Benjamin <a href="http://biblehub.com/joshua/18-21.htm">Joshua 18:21-22</a>.<p>And Bethel shall come to nought - Hosea had called "Bethel, God's house," by the name of "Bethaven <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/10-5.htm">Hosea 10:5</a>, Vanity-house." Amos, in allusion to this probably, drops the first half of the name, and says that it shall not merely be "house of vanity," but "Aven, vanity" itself.

Beer-sheba was situated in the extreme south of Judah (comp. the expression “from Dan even to Beersheba”), some 50 miles S.S.W. of Jerusalem, and 30 miles S.W. of Hebron; hence it lay far beyond the territory of Israel, and a visit to it must have been the occasion of a special pilgrimage.

But in what respect? This is explained in the words &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1506;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "for at the time," or as &#1506;&#1514; cannot stand for &#1500;&#1506;&#1514;, more correctly "when it is time," he does not place himself in, i.e., does not enter, the opening of the womb. Mishbar ba&#770;n&#305;&#772;m is to be explained as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-3.htm">2 Kings 19:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-3.htm">Isaiah 37:3</a>; and &#1506;&#1502;&#1491;, c. &#1489; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-30.htm">Ezekiel 22:30</a>. If the child does not come to the opening at the right time, the birth is retarded, and the life of both mother and child endangered. The mother and child are one person here. And this explains the transition from the pains of the mother to the behaviour of the child at the time of birth. Ephraim is an unwise son, inasmuch as even under the chastening judgment he still delays his conversion, and will not let himself be new-born, like a child, that at the time of the labour-pains will not enter the opening of the womb and so come to the birth. </body></html>
