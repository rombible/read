This is profoundly impressive, since the prophets were surrounded by the pompous nature-worship of the East.<p>The Heb. word for the Pleiades (seven stars) means properly “heap” or “cluster,” and that for Orion signifies “stout, strong one.” The appearance of the Pleiades indicated the “sweet influences” of spring, that of Orion the winter solstice. Observe that Amos the herdsman, and Job the Arabian Emir, accustomed to the naked sky of the desert, make these special references to astronomical facts. The death-shadow suggests the darkest experiences of human life. Jehovah pours His light upon the deepest gloom of our lot. He, too, can make the day dark with night, covering the noonday sky with funereal pall, as at the Crucifixion. God is also made the perennial source of the rain, that “river of God which is full of water,” and which is ever rising at His command from the great sea.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:7-17 The same almighty power can, for repenting sinners, easily turn affliction and sorrow into prosperity and joy, and as easily turn the prosperity of daring sinners into utter darkness. Evil times will not bear plain dealing; that is, evil men will not. And these men were evil men indeed, when wise and good men thought it in vain even to speak to them. Those who will seek and love that which is good, may help to save the land from ruin. It behoves us to plead God's spiritual promises, to beseech him to create in us a clean heart, and to renew a right spirit within us. The Lord is ever ready to be gracious to the souls that seek him; and then piety and every duty will be attended to. But as for sinful Israel, God's judgments had often passed by them, now they shall pass through them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seek Him that maketh the seven stars - Misbelief effaces the thought of God as He Is. It retains the name God, but means something quite different from the One True God. So people spoke of "the Deity," as a sort of First Cause of all things, and did not perceive that they only meant to own that this fair harmony of things created was not (at least as it now exists,) self-existent, and that they had lost sight of the Personal God who had made known to them His Will, whom they were to believe in, obey, fear, love. "The Deity" was no object of fear or love. It was but a bold confession that they did not mean to be Atheists, or that they meant intellectually to admire the creation. Such confessions, even when not consciously atheistic, become at least the parents of Atheism or Panotheism, and slide insensibly into either. For a First Cause, who is conceived of as no more, is an abstraction, not God. God is the Cause of all causes.<p>All things are, and have their relations to each other, as cause and effect, because He so created them. A "Great First Cause," who is only thought of as a Cause, is a mere fiction of a man's imagining, an attempt to appear to account for the mysteries of being, without owning that, since our being is from God, we are responsible creatures whom He created for Himself, and who are to yield to Him an account of the use of our being which He gave us. In like way, Israel had probably so mixed up the thought of God with Nature, that it had lost sight of God, as distinct from the creation. And so Amos, after appealing to their consciences, sets forth God to them as the Creator, Disposer of all things, and the Just God, who redresseth man's violence and injustice. The "seven stars," literally, "the heap," are the striking cluster of stars, called by Greeks and Latins the Pleiades, , which consist of seven larger stars, and in all of above forty.<p>Orion,  a constellation in one line with the Pleiades, was conceived by the Arabs and Syrians also, as a gigantic figure. The Chaldee also renders, the "violent" or "the rebel." The Hebrew title "&#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1497;&#1500;  Keciyl, fool," adds the idea of an irreligious man, which is also the meaning of Nimrod, "rebel," literally, "let us rebel." Job, in that he speaks of "the bands of Orion <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/38-31.htm">Job 38:31</a>, pictures him as "bound," the "belt" being the "band." This falls in with the later tradition, that Nimrod, who, as the founder of Babel, was the first rebel against God , was represented by the easterns in their grouping of the stars, as a giant chained , the same constellation which we call Orion.<p>And turneth the shadow of death into the morning - This is no mere alternation of night and day, no "kindling" of "each day out of night." The "shadow of death" is strictly the darkness of death, or of the grave <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/3-5.htm">Job 3:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/10-21.htm">Job 10:21-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/34-22.htm">Job 34:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-17.htm">Job 38:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-4.htm">Psalm 23:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>. It is used of darkness intense as the darkness of the grave <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/28-3.htm">Job 28:3</a>, of gloom <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/24-17.htm">Job 24:17</a>, or moral benightening (<a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-2.htm">Isaiah 9:2</a>, (1 Hebrew)) which seems to cast "the shadow of death" over the soul, of distress which is as the forerunner of death <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/16-16.htm">Job 16:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/44-19.htm">Psalm 44:19</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/107-10.htm">Psalm 107:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/107-14.htm">Psalm 107:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-6.htm">Jeremiah 2:6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/13-16.htm">Jeremiah 13:16</a>, or of things, hidden as the grave, which God alone can bring to light <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/12-22.htm">Job 12:22</a>. The word is united with darkness, physical, moral, mental, but always as intensifying it, beyond any mere darkness. Amos first sets forth the power of God, then His goodness. Out of every extremity of ill, God can, will, does, deliver. He who said, "let there be light and there was light," at once changeth any depth of darkness into light, the death-darkness of sin into the dawn of grace, the hopeless night of ignorance into "the day-star from on high," the night of the grave into the eternal morn of the Resurrection which knoweth no setting. But then on impenitence the contrary follows;<p>And maketh the day dark with night - Literally, "and darkeneth day into night." As God withdraws "the shadow of death," so that there should be no trace of it left, but all is filled with His light, so, again, when His light is abused or neglected, He so withdraws it, as at times, to leave no trace or gleam of it. Conscience becomes benighted, so as to sin undoubtingly: faith is darkened, so that the soul no more even suspects the truth. Hell has no light.<p>That calleth for the waters of the sea - This can be no other than a memory of the flood, "when the waters prevailed over the earth <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-24.htm">Genesis 7:24</a>. The prophet speaks of nothing partial. He speaks of "sea" and "earth," each, as a whole, standing against the other. "God calleth the waters of the sea and poureth them over the face of the earth." They seem ever threatening the land, but for Him "which hath placed the sand for the bound of the sea, that it cannot pass it" <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-22.htm">Jeremiah 5:22</a>. Now God calls them, and "pours them over the face," that is, the whole surface. The flood, He promised, should not again be. But it is the image of that universal destruction, which shall end man's thousands of years of rebellion against God. The words then of Amos, in their simplest sense, speak of a future universal judgment of the inhabitants of the earth, like, in extent, to that former judgment, when God "brought in the flood upon the world of the ungodly" <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>.<p>The words have been thought also to describe that daily marvel of God's Providence, how, from the salt briny sea, which could bring but barrenness, He, by the heat of the Sun, draws up the moisture, and discharges it anew in life-giving showers on the surface of the earth. God's daily care of us, in the workings of His creatures is a witness <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-17.htm">Acts 14:17</a> of His relation to us as our Father; it is an earnest also of our relation, and so of our accountableness, to Him.<p>The Lord is His name - He, the One Self-existent Unchangeable God, who revealed Himself to their forefathers, and forbade them to worship Him under any form of their own device. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the seven stars&#8212;literally, the heap or cluster of seven larger stars and others smaller (Job 9:9; 38:31).

Which some connect with the preceding words, without a supplement, "they leave righteousness on the ground, who maketh the seven stars"; understanding it of Christ, the Lord our righteousness, who is made unto us righteousness, whom the Jews rejected and despised, though the Maker of the heavens and the constellations in them. Some continue, and supply the words thus, and remember not him "that maketh the seven stars", as Kimchi; or forget him, as Japhet in Aben Ezra. The Targum is, <p>"they cease to fear him that maketh, &amp;c.'' <p>they have no regard unto him, no awe and reverence of him, or they would not act so unjustly as they do. There is but one word for the "seven stars" in the original text, which signifies that constellation called the Pleiades, and so the same word is rendered, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/9-9.htm">Job 9:9</a>; and the Vergiliae, because they appear in the spring of the year, when they yield their sweet influences, which the Scripture ascribes to them, and are desirable; hence they have their name in Hebrew from a word which signifies desire: <p>and Orion; another constellation; for Aben Ezra says, it is not one star, but many; and as he, with the ancients he mentions, takes the former to be the tail of Aries, and the head of Taurus; so this to be the heart of Scorpio. This constellation appears in winter, and is a sign of bad weather. Virgil calls it Nimbosus Orion; and it has its name in Hebrew from unsettledness and inconstancy, the weather being then very variable. Amos, being a herdsman, had observed the appearances and effects of these constellations, and adored the Maker of them, whom others neglected: <p>and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: maketh the constant revolution of day and night, and the days longer in the summer, and shorter in winter, as Kimchi interprets it; and also the various changes of prosperity and adversity, turning the one into the other when he pleases: <p>that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth; as in the time of the universal deluge, to which some Jewish writers apply this, as Jarchi observes; or rather draws up by the heat of the sun the waters of the sea into the air, and forms them into clouds, where they lose their saltness, and become sweet; and then lets them down in plentiful and gentle showers, to water, refresh, and fructify the earth; which is an instance of divine power, wisdom, and goodness. The Targum is, <p>"who commands many armies to be gathered like the waters of the sea, and scatters them upon the face of the earth.'' <p>Some, who understand these words of Christ our righteousness, interpret the whole mystically of his raising up the twelve apostles, comparable to stars; and of his turning the Gentiles, who were darkness itself, to the light of the Gospel; and of his giving up the Jews, who were formerly light, to judicial blindness and darkness; and of his watering the earth with large showers of the divine word; <p>the Lord is his name; he is the true Jehovah, that can and does do all this. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/amos/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Seek him</i> that <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD <i>is</i> his name:</span><p>(e) He describes the power of God; Job 9:9.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/amos/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">8–9</span>.

This and the following clause do not simply state that the regular interchange of day and night is in God's hands, but rather notify that God is a moral Governor of the world. He saves men from the utmost dangers, from the darkness of sin and from the night of ignorance; and, on the other hand, he sends calamity on those that offend his Law (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Maketh the day dark with night;</span> literally, as the Septuagint <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bd;&#x1f7b;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, "darkeneth day into night." <span class="cmt_word">That calleth for the waters of the sea,</span> etc. As judgments are the prophet's theme, this expression cannot be an intimation of the working of the natural law by which the moisture taken up from the sea as cloud returns upon the earth as rain (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/9-6.htm">Amos 9:6</a>). Rather it is an allusion to the Flood and similar catastrophes, which are proofs of God's judicial government of the universe, when "he maketh the creature his weapon for the revenge of his enemies" (Wisd. 5:17). <span class="cmt_word">The Lord is his Name.</span> Jehovah, the self-existent God, doeth all these marvellous things, and men presume to scout his Law and think to be unpunished (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-13.htm">Amos 4:13</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/hosea/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>(Heb.

"Samaria will atone, because it has rebelled against its God: they will fall by the sword; their children will be dashed to pieces, and its women with child ripped up." &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, to atone, to bear the guilt, i.e., the punishment. It is not equivalent to sha&#770;me&#772;m in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>, although, as a matter of fact, the expiation consisted in the conquest and devastation of Samaria by Shalmanezer. The subject to yippelu&#772; (will fall) is the inhabitants of Samaria. The suffix to &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; (its women, etc.) refers to the nation. The form &#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492; is one derived from &#1492;&#1512;&#1492;, for &#1492;&#1512;&#1492; (Ewald, 189, c). The construction with the masculine verb &#1497;&#1489;&#1511;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;, in the place of the feminine, is an anomaly, which may be explained from the fact that feminine formations from the plur. imperf. are generally very rare (see Ewald, 191, b).
