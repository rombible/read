There is a remarkable play of words, <span class= "ital">qaits</span> being the Hebrew for “summer fruit,” and <span class= "ital">qêts</span> for “end.” It is harvest time, the end of the agricultural year. Israel is ripe for his final doom, that shall sweep down like a scythe. For “pass by” see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/7-8.htm" title="And the LORD said to me, Amos, what see you?

This one is therefore intended to be taken as the continuation of these, and it is in substance a repetition of the third, only with more detail and emphasis. An insolent attempt, by the priest of Beth-el, to silence the Prophet, and the fiery answer which he got for his pains, come between. The stream of Amos’s prophecy flows on, uninterrupted by the boulder which had tried to dam it up. Some courage was needed to treat Amaziah and his blasphemous bluster as a mere parenthesis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> We have first to note the vision and its interpretation. It is such as a countryman, ‘a dresser of sycamore trees’ would naturally have. Experience supplies forms and material for the imagination, and moulds into which God-given revelations run. The point of the vision is rather obscured by the rendering ‘summer fruit.’ ‘Ripe fruit’ would be better, since the emblem represents the Northern Kingdom as ripe for the dreadful ingathering of judgment. The word for this {<span class="ital">qayits</span>} and that for ‘the end’ {<span class="ital">qets</span>} are alike in sound, but the play of words cannot be reproduced, except by some clumsy device, such as ‘the end ripens’ or ‘the time of ripeness comes.’ The figure is frequent in other prophecies of judgment, as, for instance, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-14.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and on the cloud one sat like to the Son of man, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.">Revelation 14:14</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/14-20.htm" title="And the wine press was trodden without the city, and blood came out of the wine press, even to the horse bridles, by the space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.">Revelation 14:20</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Observe the repetition, from the preceding vision, of ‘I will not pass by them any more.’ The first two visions had threatened judgments, which had been averted by the Prophet’s intercession; but the third, and now the fourth, declare that the time for prolonged impunity is passed. Just as the mellow ripeness of the fruit fixes the time of gathering it, so there comes a stage in national and individual corruption, when there is nothing to be done but to smite. That period is not reached because God changes, but because men get deeper in sin. Because ‘the harvest is ripe,’ the long-delayed command, ‘Put in thy sickle’ is given to the angel of judgment, and the clusters of those black grapes, whose juice in the wine-press of the wrath of God is blood, are cut down and cast in. It is a solemn lesson, applying to each soul as well as to communities. By neglect of God’s voice, and persistence in our own evil ways, we can make ourselves such that we are ripe for judgment, and can compel long-suffering to strike. Which are we ripening for-the harvest when the wheat shall be gathered into Christ’s barns, or that when the tares shall be bound in bundles for burning?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The tragedy of that fruit-gathering is described with extraordinary grimness and force in the abrupt language of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm" title="And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, said the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.">Amos 8:3</a>. The merry songs sung in the palace {this rendering seems more appropriate here than ‘temple’} will be broken off, and the singers’ voices will quaver into shrill shrieks, so suddenly will the judgment be. Then comes a picture as abrupt in its condensed terribleness as anything in Tacitus-’Many the corpses; everywhere they fling them; hush!’ We see the ghastly masses of dead {‘corpse’ is in the singular, as if a collective noun}, so numerous that no burial-places could hold them; and no ceremonial attended them, but they were rudely flung anywhere by anybody {no nominative is given}, with no accustomed voice of mourning, but in gloomy silence. It is like Defoe’s picture of the dead-cart in the plague of London. Such is ever the end of departing from God-songs palsied into silence or turned into wailing when the judgment bursts; death stalking supreme, and silence brooding over all.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The crimes that ripened men for this terrible harvest are next set forth, in part, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm" title="Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,">Amos 8:4</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-6.htm" title="That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes; yes, and sell the refuse of the wheat?">Amos 8:6</a>. These verses partly coincide verbally with the previous indictment in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes;">Amos 2:6</a>, etc., which, however, is more comprehensive. Here only one form of sin is dealt with. And what was the sin that deserved the bad eminence of being thus selected as the chief sign that Israel was ripe and rotten? Precisely the one which gets most indulgence in the Christian Church; namely, eagerness to be rich, and sharp, unkindly dealing. These men, who were only fit to be swept out of the land, were most punctual in their religious duties. They would not on any account do business either on a festival or on Sabbath, but they were very impatient till-shall we say? Monday morning came-that they might get to their beloved work again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Their lineal descendants are no strangers on the exchanges, or in the churches of London or New York. They were not only outwardly scrupulous and inwardly weary of religious observances, but when they did get to ‘business,’ they gave short measure and took a long price, and knew how to turn the scales always in their own favour. It was the expedient of rude beginners in the sacred art of getting the best of a bargain, to put a false bottom in the <span class="ital">ephah</span>, and to stick a piece of lead below the shekel weight, which the purchaser had to make go up in the scale with his silver. There are much neater ways of doing the same thing now; and no doubt some very estimable gentlemen in high repute as Christians, who give respectability to any church or denomination, could have taught these early practitioners a lesson or two.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> They were as cruel as they were greedy. They bought their brethren as slaves, and if a poor man had run into their debt for even a pair of shoes, they would sell him up in a very literal sense. Avarice, unbridled by the fear of God, leads by a short cut to harshness and disregard of the claims of others. There are more ways of buying the needy for a pair of shoes than these people practised.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The last touch in the picture is meanness, which turned everything into money. Even what fell through the sieve when wheat was winnowed, which ought to have been given to anybody, was carefully scraped up, and, dirty as it was, sold. Is not ‘nothing for nothing’ an approved maxim to-day? Are not people held up as shining lights of commerce, who have the faculty of turning everything into saleable articles? Some serious reflections ought to be driven home to us who live in great commercial communities, and are in manifold ways tempted to ‘learn their ways, and so get a snare unto our souls,’ by this gibbeting of tempers and customs, very common among ourselves, as the very head and front of the sin of Israel, which determined its ripeness for destruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The catalogue of sins is left incomplete {compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-1.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:">Amos 2:1</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/2-16.htm" title="And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, said the LORD.">Amos 2:16</a>}, as if holy indignation turned for relief to the thought of the certain judgment. That certainly is strongly affirmed by the representation of the oath of Jehovah. ‘He can swear by no other,’ therefore He ‘swears by Himself’; and the ‘excellency of Jacob’ cannot with propriety mean anything else than Him who is, or ought to be, the sole ground of confidence and occasion of ‘boasting’ to the nation {<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm" title="And the pride of Israel does testify to his face: therefore shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also shall fall with them.">Hosea 5:5</a>}. He gives His own being as the guarantee that judgment shall fall. As surely as God is God, injustice and avarice will ruin a nation. We talk now about necessary consequences and natural laws rendering penalties inevitable. The Bible suggests a deeper foundation for their certain incidence-even the very nature of God Himself. As long as He is what He is, covetousness and its child, harshness to the needy, will be sin against Him, and be avenged sooner or later. God has a long and a wide memory, and the sins which He ‘remembers’ are those which He has not forgiven, and will punish.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Amos heaps image on image to deepen the impression of terror and confusion. Everything is turned to its opposite. The solid land reels, rises, and falls, like the Nile in flood {see Revised Version}. The sun sets at midday, and noon is darkness. Feasts change to mourning, songs to lamentations. Rich garments are put aside for sackcloth, and flowing locks drop off and leave bald heads. These are evidently all figures vividly piled together to express the same thought. The crash that destroyed their national prosperity and existence would shake the most solid things and darken the brightest. It would come suddenly, as if the sun plunged from the zenith to the west. It would make joy a stranger, and bring grief as bitter as when a father or a mother mourns the death of an only son. Besides all this, something darker beyond is dimly hinted in that awful, vague, final threat, ‘The end thereof as a bitter day.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> Now all these threats were fulfilled in the fall of the kingdom of Israel; but that ‘day of the Lord’ was in principle a miniature foreshadowing of the great final judgment. Some of the very features of the description here are repeated with reference to it in the New Testament. We cannot treat such prophecies as this as if they were exhausted by their historical fulfilment. They disclose the eternal course of divine judgment, which is to culminate in a future day of judgment. The oath of God is not yet completely fulfilled. Assuredly as He lives and is God, so surely will modern sinners have to stand their trial; and, as of old, the chase after riches will bring down crashing ruin. We need that vision of judgment as much as Samaria did when Amos saw the basket of ripe fruit, craving, as it were, to be plucked. So do obstinate sinners invite destruction.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The last section specifies one feature of judgment, the deprivation of the despised word of the Lord {<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-11.htm" title="Behold, the days come, said the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:">Amos 8:11</a> - <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-14.htm" title="They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Your god, O Dan, lives; and, The manner of Beersheba lives; even they shall fall, and never rise up again.">Amos 8:14</a>}. Like Saul, whose piteous wail in the witch’s hovel was, ‘God . . . answereth me no more,’ they who paid no heed to the word of the Lord shall one day seek far and wearily for a prophet, and seek in vain. The word rendered ‘wander,’ which is used in the other description of people seeking for water in a literal drought {<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-8.htm" title="So two or three cities wandered to one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied: yet have you not returned to me, said the LORD.">Amos 4:8</a>}, means ‘reel,’ and gives the picture of men faint and dizzy with thirst, yet staggering on in vain quest for a spring. They seek everywhere, from the Dead Sea on the east to the Mediterranean on the west, and then up to the north, and so round again to the starting-point. Is it because Judah was south that that quarter is not visited? Perhaps, if they had gone where the Temple was, they would have found the stream from under its threshold, which a later prophet saw going forth to heal the marshes and dry places. Why was the search vain? Has not God promised to be found of those that seek, however far they have gone away? The last verse tells why. They still were idolaters, swearing by the ‘sin of Samaria,’ which is the calf of Beth-el, and by the other at Dan, and going on idolatrous pilgrimages to Beer-sheba, far away in the south, across the whole kingdom of Judah {<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-5.htm" title="But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.">Amos 5:5</a>}. It was vain to seek for the word of the Lord with such doings and worship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span> The truth implied is universal in its application. God’s message neglected is withdrawn. Conscience stops if continually unheeded. The Gospel may still sound in a man’s ears, but have long ceased to reach farther. There comes a time when men shall wish wasted opportunities back, and find that they can no more return than last summer’s heat. There may be a wish for the prophet in time of distress, which means no real desire for God’s word, but only for relief from calamity. There may be a sort of seeking for the word, which seeks in the wrong places and in the wrong ways, and without abandoning sins. Such quest is vain. But if, driven by need and sorrow, a poor soul, feeling the thirst after the living God, cries from ever so distant a land of bondage, the cry will be answered. But let us not forget that our Lord has told us to take heed how we hear, on the very ground that ‘to him that hath shall be given; and from him that hath not, even that he hath shall be taken away.’<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/8-1.htm" title="Thus has the Lord GOD showed to me: and behold a basket of summer fruit....">Amos 8:1-2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Behold a basket of summer fruit — </span>This symbolically denoted that Israel’s sins were now ripe for judgment, and that as the fruit, when it is ripe, is taken from the trees, so, their iniquity being now ripe, they should be taken off the land in which they dwelt.

Such summer fruits will not keep till winter, but must be used at once. Yet these judgments shall not draw from them any acknowledgement, either of God's righteousness or their own unrighteousness. Sinners put off repentance from day to day, because they think the Lord thus delays his judgments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Thus hath the Lord God showed me - The sentence of Amaziah pronounced, Amos resumes just where he left off, before Amaziah broke in upon him. His vehement interruption is like a stone cast into the deep waters. They close over it, and it leaves no trace. Amos had authenticated the third vision; "Thus hath the Lord God shewed me." He resumes in the self-same calm words. The last vision declared that the end was certain; this, that it was at hand.<p>A basket of summer fruit - The fruit was the latest harvest in Palestine. When it was gathered, the circle of husbandry was come to its close. The sight gives an idea of completeness. The symbol, and the word expressing it, coincide. The fruit-gathering &#1511;&#1497;&#1509;  qayits, like our "crop," was called from "cutting." So was the word, "end," "cutting off," in (&#1511;&#1509;  qe&#770;ts). At harvest-time there is no more to be done for that crop. Good or bad, it has reached its end, and is cut down. So the harvest of Israel was come. The whole course of God's providences, mercies, chastenings, visitations, instructions, warnings, in spirations, were completed. "What could have been done more to My vineyard, God asks <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-4.htm">Isaiah 5:4</a>, that I have not done in it?" "To the works of sin, as of holiness, there is a beginning, progress, completion;" a "sowing of wild oats," as people speak, and a ripening in wickedness; a maturity of people's plans, as they deem; a maturity for destruction, in the sight of God. There was no more to be done. heavenly influences can but injure the ripened sinner, as dew, rain, sun, but injure the ripened fruit Israel was ripe, but for destruction. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 8<p>Am 8:1-14.

And ye sons of Zion, exult and rejoice in the Lord your God; for He giveth you the teacher for righteousness, and causes to come down to you a rain-fall, early rain and latter rain, first of all." The soil had suffered from the drought connected with the swarms of locusts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>); the beasts of the field had groaned on account of the destruction of all the plants and vegetation of every kind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>); the men had sighed over the unparalleled calamity that had befallen both land and people. The prophet here calls to all of them not to fear, but to exult and rejoice, and gives in every case an appropriate reason for the call. In that of the earth, he introduces the thought that Jehovah had done great things - had destroyed the foe that did great things; in that of the beasts, he points to the fresh verdure of the pastures, and the growth of the fruit upon the trees; in that of men, he lays stress upon a double fact, viz., the gift of a teacher for righteousness, and the pouring out of a plentiful rain. In this description we have to notice the rhetorical individualizing, which forms its peculiar characteristic, and serves to explain not only the distinction between the earth, the beasts of the field, and the sons of Zion, but the distribution of the divine blessings among the different members of the creation that are mentioned here. For, so far as the fact itself is concerned, the threefold blessing from God benefits all three classes of the earthly creation: the rain does good not only to the sons of Zion, or to men, but also to animals and to the soil; and so again do the green of the pastures and the fruits of the trees; and lastly, even the &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1497;&#1497; &#1500;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1514; not only blesses the earth, but also the beasts and men upon it. It is only through overlooking this rhetorico-poetical distribution, that any one could infer from <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a>, that because the fruits are mentioned here as the ordinary food of animals, in direct contrast to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-28.htm">Genesis 1:28-29</a>, where the fruit of the trees is assigned to men for food, the beasts of the field signify the heathen. The perfects in the explanatory clauses of these three verses are all to be taken alike, and not to be rendered in the preterite in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-21.htm">Joel 2:21</a>, and in the present in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-22.htm">Joel 2:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>. The perfect is not only applied to actions, which the speaker looks upon from his own standpoint as actually completed, as having taken place, or as things belonging to the past, but to actions which the will or the lively fancy of the speaker regards as being as good as completed, in other words, assumes as altogether unconditional and certain, and to which in modern languages we should apply the present (Ewald, 135, a, etc.). The latter is the sense in which it is used here, since the prophet sets forth the divine promise as a fact, which is unquestionably certain and complete, even though its historical realization has only just begun, and extends into the nearer or more remote future. The divine act over which the prophet calls upon them to rejoice, is not to be restricted to the destruction of those swarms of locusts that had at that time invaded Judah, and the revivification of drying nature, but is an act of God that is being constantly repeated whenever the same circumstances occur, or whose influence continues as long as this earth lasts; since it is a tangible pledge, that to all eternity, as is stated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-26.htm">Joel 2:26</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-27.htm">Joel 2:27</a>, the people of the Lord will not be put to shame. The "sons of Zion" are not merely the inhabitants of Zion itself, but the dwellers in the capital are simply mentioned as the representatives of the kingdom of Judah. As the plague of locusts fell not upon Jerusalem only, but upon the whole land, the call to rejoicing must refer to all the inhabitants of the land (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-2.htm">Joel 1:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>). They are to rejoice in Jehovah, who has proved Himself to be their God by the removal of the judgment and the bestowal of a fresh blessing.<p>This blessing is twofold in its nature. He gives them &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1492; &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;. From time immemorial there has been a diversity of opinion as to the meaning of these words. Most of the Rabbins and earlier commentators have followed the Chaldee and Vulgate, and taken mo&#772;reh in the sense of "teacher;" but others, in no small number, have taken it in the sense of "early rain," e.g., Ab. Ezra, Kimchi, Tanch., Calvin, and most of the Calvinistic and modern commentators. But although mo&#772;reh is unquestionably used in the last clause of this verse in the sense of early rain; in every other instance this is called yo&#772;reh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>); for <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-7.htm">Psalm 84:7</a> cannot be brought into the account since the meaning is disputed. Consequently the conjecture is a very natural one, that in the last clause of the verse Joel selected the form mo&#772;reh, instead of yo&#772;reh, to signify early rain, simply on account of the previous occurrence of hammo&#772;reh in the sense of "teacher," and for the sake of the unison. This rendering of hammo&#772;reh is not only favoured by thee article placed before it, since neither mo&#772;reh  equals  yo&#772;reh (early rain), nor the corresponding and tolerably frequent malqo&#772;sh (latter rain), ever has the article, and no reason can be discovered why mo&#772;reh should be defined by the article here if it signified early rain; but it is decisively confirmed by the following word &#1500;&#1510;&#1491;&#1511;&#1492;, which is quite inapplicable to early rain, since it cannot mean either "in just measure," or "at the proper time," or "in becoming manner," as tseda&#770;qa&#770;h is only used in the ethical sense of righteousness, and is never met with sensu physico, neither in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-29.htm">2 Samuel 19:29</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/2-20.htm">Nehemiah 2:20</a>, nor in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-3.htm">Psalm 23:3</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-36.htm">Leviticus 19:36</a>, where moreover &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; occurs. For &#1502;&#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511; (in the Psalm) are not straight or right ways, but ways of righteousness (spiritual ways); and although &#1502;&#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, &#1488;&#1489;&#1504;&#1497; &#1510;&#1491;&#1511;, are no doubt really correct scales and weight-stones, this is simply because they correspond to what is ethically right, so that we cannot deduce from this the idea of correct measure in the case of the rain. Ewald and Umbreit, who both of them recognise the impossibility of proving that tseda&#770;qa&#770;h is used in the physical sense of correctness or correct measure, have therefore adopted the rendering "rain for justification," or "for righteousness;" Ewald regarding the rain as a sign that they are adopted again into the righteousness of God, whilst Umbreit takes it as a manifestation of eternal righteousness in the flowing stream of fertilizing grace. But apart from the question, whether these thoughts are in accordance with the doctrine of Scripture, they are by no means applicable here, where the people have neither doubted the revelation of the righteousness of God, nor prayed to God for justification, but have rather appealed to the compassion and grace of God in the consciousness of their sin and guilt, and prayed to be spared and rescued from destruction (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-13.htm">Joel 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>). By the "teacher for righteousness," we are to understand neither the prophet Joel only (v. Hofmann), nor the Messiah directly (Abarbanel), nor the idea teacher or collective body of messengers from God (Hengstenberg), although there is some truth at the foundation of all these suppositions. The direct or exclusive reference to the Messiah is at variance wit the context, since all the explanatory clauses in vv. 21-23 treat of blessings or gifts of God, which were bestowed at any rate partially at that particular time. Moreover, in v. 23, the sending of the rain-fall is represented by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; (imperf. c. Vav cons.), if not as the consequence of the sending of the teacher for righteousness, at any rate as a contemporaneous event. These circumstances apparently favour the application of the expression to the prophet Joel. Nevertheless, it is by no means probable that Joel describes himself directly as the teacher for righteousness, or speaks of his being sent to the people as the object of exultation. No doubt he had induced the people to turn to the Lord, and to offer penitential supplication for His mercy through his call to repentance, and thereby effected the consequent return of rain and fruitful seasons; but his address and summons would not have had this result, if the people had not been already instructed by Moses, by the priests, and by other prophets before himself, concerning the ways of the Lord. All of these were teachers for righteousness, and are included under hammo&#772;reh. Still we must not stop at them. As the blessings of grace, at the reception of which the people were to rejoice, did not merely consist, as we have just observed, in the blessings which came to it at that time, or in Joel's days, but also embraced those which were continually bestowed upon it by the Lord; we must not exclude the reference to the Messiah, to whom Moses had already pointed as the prophet whom the Lord would raise up unto them, and to whom they were to hearken (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/18-18.htm">Deuteronomy 18:18-19</a>), but must rather regard the sending of the Messiah as the final fulfilment of this promise. This view answers to the context, if we simply notice that Joel mentions here both the spiritual and material blessings which the Lord is conveying to His people, and then in what follows expounds the material blessings still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23-27</a>, and the spiritual blessings in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-32</a> and ch. 3. They are both of them consequences of the gift of the teacher for righteousness.<p>Hence the expansion of the earthly saving gifts is attached by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491; with Vav cons. Joel mentions first of all geshem, a rain-fall, or plentiful rain for the fertilizing of the soil and then defines it more exactly as early rain, which fell in the autumn at the sowing time and promoted the germination and growth of the seed, and latter rain, which occurred in the spring shortly before the time of harvest and brought the crops to maturity (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-3.htm">Leviticus 26:3</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, in the beginning, i.e., first ( equals  &#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/33-2.htm">Genesis 33:2</a>, just as &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/9-15.htm">Leviticus 9:15</a> for &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-13.htm">Numbers 10:13</a>), not in the first month (Chald., etc.), or in the place of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1474;&#1504;&#1492;, as before (lxx, Vulg., and others). For &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; corresponds to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1470;&#1499;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-1.htm">Hebrews 3:1</a>), as Ewald, Meier, and Hengstenberg admit. First of all the pouring out of a plentiful rain (an individualizing expression for all kinds of earthly blessings, chosen here with reference to the opposite of blessing occasioned by the drought); and after that, the pouring out of the spiritual blessing (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28-3:21</a>). </body></html>
