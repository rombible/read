It appears that there were not so many prophets in the land of Israel, about the time that their destruction came upon them, as there were in the land of Judah; and after the ten tribes were carried away captive, they <span class="ital">saw not their signs; </span>there were <span class="ital">no more any prophets </span>among them; none to show them <span class="ital">How long; </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm" title="We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is there among us any that knows how long.">Psalm 74:9</a>. The Jewish church also, after Malachi, had no prophets for many ages. Now, 1st, This was the departure of a great part of their glory: what especially made their nation great and high was, that <span class="ital">to them were committed the oracles of God: </span>but when these were taken from them their beauty was stained, and their honour laid in the dust. 2d, This was a token of God’s highest displeasure against them: surely he was angry indeed with them, when he would no more speak to them as he had done; and had abandoned them to ruin, when he would no more reprove them for their sins, and call them to repentance by his messengers. 3d, This made all the other calamities that were upon them truly melancholy; that they had no prophets to instruct and comfort them from the word of God, nor to give them any hopeful prospect. We should say at any time, and shall be compelled to say in a time of trouble, that a famine of the word of God is, of all others, the sorest famine — the heaviest judgment. It is not improbable that this threatening was intended to look further than to the judgment now referred to, even to <span class="ital">the blindness </span>which has <span class="ital">in part happened to Israel, </span>in the days of the Messiah, and the veil that is on the hearts of the unbelieving Jews. They reject the gospel, and the ministers of it, which God sends to them, and covet to have prophets of their own, as their fathers had; but they shall have none, the kingdom of God being taken from them and given to another people.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:11-14 Here was a token of God's highest displeasure. At any time, and most in a time of trouble, a famine of the word of God is the heaviest judgment. To many this is no affliction, yet some will feel it very much, and will travel far to hear a good sermon; they feel the loss of the mercies others foolishly sin away. But when God visits a backsliding church, their own plans and endeavours to find out a way of salvation, will stand them in no stead. And the most amiable and zealous would perish, for want of the water of life, which Christ only can bestow. Let us value our advantages, seek to profit by them, and fear sinning them away.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not a famine for bread - He does not deny that there should be bodily famine too; but this, grievous as it is, would be less grievous than the famine of which he speaks, "the famine of the word of the Lord." In distress we all go to God. Rib.: "They who now cast out and despise the prophets, when they shall see themselves besieged by the enemy, shall be tormented with a great hunger of hearing the word of the Lord from the mouths of the prophets, and shall find no one to lighten their distresses. This was most sad to the people of God; 'we see not our tokens; there is not one prophet more; there is not one with us who understandeth, how long!' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a>." Even the profane, when they see no help, will have recourse to God. Saul, in his extremity, "inquired of the Lord and He answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/28-6.htm">1 Samuel 28:6</a>. Jeroboam sent his wife to inquire of the prophet Ahijah about his son's health <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/14-2.htm">1 Kings 14:2-3</a>.

Compare as to the Jews' rejection of Messiah, and their consequent rejection by Him (Mt 21:43); and their desire for Messiah too late (Lu 17:22; Joh 7:34; 8:21). So, the prodigal when he had sojourned awhile in the "far-off country, began to be in want" in the "mighty famine" which arose (Lu 15:14; compare 1Sa 3:1; 7:2). It is remarkable that the Jews' religion is almost the only one that could be abolished against the will of the people themselves, on account of its being dependent on a particular place, namely, the temple. When that was destroyed, the Mosaic ritual, which could not exist without it, necessarily ceased. Providence designed it, that, as the law gave way to the Gospel, so all men should perceive it was so, in spite of the Jews' obstinate rejection of the Gospel.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Behold; </span> note well what now I shall declare to you, and consider it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The days come, saith the Lord God; </span> surely, speedily, and according to the threats of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I will send a famine in the land; </span> by a signal hand of Divine displeasure it shall appear to be from God, that such a famine cometh upon them of Israel. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water:</span> a spiritual famine joined with a corporal famine; their bodies were pined with famine, destitute of bread and water; and this God sent too. but the famine of the soul is worse and more grievous. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">But of hearing the words; </span> either the written word which Israel had among them till their captivity, but afterwards should ever want both it and those who should interpret it to them, or else the word of prophecy; now they despise it, though they have it, but then they shall desire it, and have it not.

Which Kimchi interprets of all the days of the second house or temple after Malachi, when prophecy ceased; but it rather has respect to the time of Shalmaneser's carrying captive the ten tribes, when they had no more prophets nor prophecy among them, or any to tell how long their captivity should last, or when it would be better times with them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/74-9.htm">Psalm 74:9</a>; <p>that I will send a famine in the land; which, in a literal sense, is one of God's arrows he has in his quiver, and sends out when he pleases; or one of his sore judgments, which he sometimes orders to come upon a people for their sins: but here is meant, <p>not a famine of bread; or through want of that, which is very dreadful; as was the famine of Samaria, when an ass's head was sold for fourscore pieces of silver, and a certain measure of dove's dung for five pieces of silver, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-25.htm">2 Kings 6:25</a>; and as were the famines of Jerusalem, when taken both by the Chaldeans and Romans, when delicate women boiled and ate their own children, <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/4-8.htm">Lamentations 4:8</a>; <p>nor a thirst for water; which is more distressing and tormenting than hunger; and to be slain with thirst is to be destroyed in the most afflictive manner, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-3.htm">Hosea 2:3</a>. Lysimachus is said to part with his kingdom for a draught of water; and the torments of hell are set forth by a violent thirst for it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-24.htm">Luke 16:24</a>; but something worse than either of these is here threatened: <p>but of hearing the words of the Lord; the word of prophecy, and the preaching of the word, or explaining the Scriptures. Of this blessing the ten tribes were deprived at their captivity, and have been ever since; and the Jews, upon their rejection of Christ, have had the kingdom of God, the Gospel of the kingdom, the word and ordinances of God, taken from them, and remain so to this day; the seven churches of Asia have had their candlestick removed out of its place, and this famine continues in those parts to this time; and, by the symptoms upon us, we may justly fear it, will be our case before long. "The words of the Lord" are the Scriptures, which cone from him, and are concerning him; the doctrines of grace contained in them, the wholesome words of Christ: hearing them signifies the preaching of them, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-1.htm">Isaiah 53:1</a>; by which hearing comes, and is a great blessing, and should be attended to, as being the means of conversion, regenerations, the knowledge of Christ, faith in him, and the joy of it. Now, to be deprived of hearing the Gospel is a spiritual famine, for that is food, bread, meat, milk, honey, yea, a feast; it is food that is savoury, wholesome, nourishing, satisfying, strengthening, and comforting; and when this is took away a famine ensues, as when a church state is dissolved, ministers are ordered to preach no more in such a place, or are scattered by persecution, or removed by death, and none raised up in their stead; or when error prevails, to the suppressing of truth: all which is done, or suffered to be done, for indifference to the word of God, unfruitfulness under it, and contempt of it, and, opposition to it; which is a dreadful case, when such a famine is; for the glory, riches, and light of a nation, are gone; bread for their souls is no more; and the means of conversion, knowledge, comfort, &amp;c. cease; and people in course must die, for lack of these things; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-1.htm">Isaiah 3:1</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/amos/8.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/amos/8.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Behold</span>, <span class="bld">days are coming</span>] <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/4-2.htm" title="The Lord GOD has sworn by his holiness, that, see, the days shall come on you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.">Amos 4:2</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">words</span>] Read probably (with many MSS., LXX.

Then, in the general distress, there will be an eagerness to hear that word of Jehovah, which is now scorned and rejected: men will seek everywhere throughout the land to find a prophet who will declare it to them, but in vain.

But it is only by the world and its children that the terrible day of the Lord is to be feared; to the children of God it brings redemption (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/21-28.htm">Luke 21:28</a>). Whoever calls upon the name of Jehovah, i.e., the believing worshippers of the Lord, will be exempted from the judgment. "Calling upon the name of Jehovah" signifies not only the public worship of God, but inward worship also, in which the confession of the mouth is also an expression of the heart. Upon Mount Zion will be pele&#772;ta&#770;h, i.e., not deliverance, but that which has escaped, or, in a collective sense, those who have escaped the judgment, as the synonym ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m, which follows, clearly shows. Mount Zion and Jerusalem are not mentioned here as the capital of the kingdom of Judah, but, according to their spiritual significance, as the place where the Lord was enthroned in the sanctuary in the midst of His people; that is to say, as the central spot of the kingdom of God. Consequently it is not "to the whole nation of Judah as such that deliverance is promised, on the assumption that in those times of distress the population of the land would have streamed to Jerusalem" (Hitzig), but only to those who call upon the name of the Lord, i.e., to the true worshippers of God, upon whom the Spirit of God is poured out. The words &#1499;&#1468;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497; are not synonymous with &#1504;&#1488;&#1501; &#1497;&#1497; or &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1497; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-8.htm">Joel 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-20.htm">Isaiah 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/40-5.htm">Isaiah 40:5</a>, etc.), but point to a prophetic word already known, viz., to <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>, where the saying of the Lord, that in the midst of the judgment there would be rescued ones upon Mount Zion, occurs word for word. &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; also depends &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; ... &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;: "and among those that remain will be those whom Jehovah calls." Sa&#770;r&#305;&#772;d is one who is left after a judgment or a battle; hence in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-17.htm">Jeremiah 42:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/8-22.htm">Joshua 8:22</a> it is connected with pa&#770;l&#305;&#772;t (one who has escaped from destruction), so that here ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m and pele&#772;ta&#770;h are actually alike, the ser&#305;&#772;d&#305;&#772;m being just the escaped ones upon Mount Zion. Through this clause there is appended to what precedes the fresh definition, that among the saved will be found those whom the Lord calls. These may either be the believing portion of Judah, or believers from among the heathen. If we adopted the first view, the sentence would simply contain a more precise definition of the thought, that none are saved but those who call upon the name of the Lord, and therefore would preclude the possibility of including all the inhabitants of Judah among those who call upon the Lord. If we took the second view, the sentence would add this new feature to the thought contained in the first hemistich, that not only citizens of Jerusalem and Judah would be saved in the time of judgment, but all who called upon the Lord out of every nation. The latter view deserves the preference, because the expression &#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1497;&#1497; did not need a more precise definition. The salvation of believers from the heathen world is implied in the first half of the verse, since it is simply connected with calling upon the name of the Lord. The Apostle Paul has quoted it in this sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-13.htm">Romans 10:13</a>, as a proof of the participation of the heathen in the Messianic salvation.<p>If we proceed now to seek for the fulfilment of this prophecy, the Apostle Peter quoted the whole of these verses (28-32), with the exception of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>, after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the disciples, on the first Whitsuntide feast of the apostolical church, as having been fulfilled by that Whitsuntide miracle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-17.htm">Acts 2:17-21</a>); and in his subsequent reference to this fulfilment in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-39.htm">Joel 2:39</a>, "For the promise is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call," he even adds the closing words of Joel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-32.htm">Joel 2:32</a>).<p>(Note: In quoting this passage Peter follows the lxx on the whole, even in their deviations from the original text, viz., in &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; instead of &#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-28.htm">Joel 2:28</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-29.htm">Joel 2:29</a>), in the addition of &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#768;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2; and &#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-29.htm">Joel 2:29</a>), in &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#834; for &#1504;&#1493;&#1512;&#1488; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a>), because these differences were of no consequence, so far as his object was concerned. On the other hand, he has interpreted &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1; (&#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1503;) by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, and added for the same purpose, &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;. He has also transposed the two clauses &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; ... and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;, probably simply for the purpose of letting the youths follow the sons and daughters, and placing the old men in the third row; and lastly, he has added &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834; ..., and &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9; to &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2;, to give greater prominence to the antithesis.)<p>Consequently the Christian church from time immemorial has recognised in the miracle of Pentecost the outpouring of the Spirit of God predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm">Joel 2:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-2.htm">Joel 2:2</a> :<p>(Note: See Hengstenberg, Christol. i. pp. 345, 346, translation.)<p>so that the only point upon which there has been a division of opinion has been, whether the fulfilment is to be confined to the feast of Pentecost (as nearly all the fathers and earlier Lutheran commentators suppose); or is to be sought for in certain events of Joel's own time, as well as the first feast of Pentecost (Ephr. Syr., Grot., and others); or, lastly, whether the occurrence at the first feast of Pentecost is to be regarded as simply the beginning of the fulfilment which has continued throughout the whole of the Christian era (Calov., Hengstenberg, and many others). Even the Rabbins, with the exception of R. Mose Hakkohen in Aben Ezra, who sees only a reference to some event in Joel's own time, expect the fulfilment to take place in the future on the advent of the Messiah (Yarchi, Kimchi, Abarb.). Of the three views expressed by Christian commentators, the third is the only one that answers to the nature of the prophecy as correctly interpreted. The outpouring of the Spirit of God, or the communication of it in all its fulness to the covenant nation, without any limitation whatever, is a standing mark with the prophets of the Messianic times (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/32-15.htm">Isaiah 32:15</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-9.htm">Isaiah 11:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-13.htm">Isaiah 54:13</a>) or new covenant (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-33.htm">Jeremiah 31:33-34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-26.htm">Ezekiel 36:26</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/12-10.htm">Zechariah 12:10</a>). And even if the way was opened and prepared for this by the prophetic endowment of particular members of the old covenant, these sporadic communications of the Spirit of God in the Old Testament times cannot be regarded as the first steps in the fulfilment of our prophecy, since they were not outpourings of the Spirit of God. This first took place when Christ Jesus the Son of God had completed the work of redemption, i.e., on the first feast of Pentecost after the resurrection and ascension of Christ. Previous to this the words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/7-39.htm">John 7:39</a> applied: &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9; &#x3b7;&#787;&#834;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b9; &#x3bf;&#788; &#x399;&#787;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3c9; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;. The reference in this prophecy to the founding of the new covenant, or Christian church, is also evident from the words, "And it shall come to pass afterwards," for which Peter substituted, "And it shall come to pass in the last days," interpreting &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497; &#1499;&#1503;, the use of which was occasioned by the retrospective reference to &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>, with perfect correctness so far as the fact was concerned, by the formula answering to &#1489;&#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, viz., &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, which always denotes the Messianic future, or times of the completion of the kingdom of God. And just as acha&#774;re&#772; khe&#772;n precludes any reference to an event in Joel's own time, so does &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b7;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; preclude any fulfilment whatever in the times before Christ. But however certain it may be that the fulfilment first took place at the first Christian feast of Pentecost, we must not stop at this one pentecostal miracle. The address of the Apostle Peter by no means requires this limitation, but rather contains distinct indications that Peter himself saw nothing more therein than the commencement of the fulfilment, "but a commencement, indeed, which embraced the ultimate fulfilment, as the germ enfolds the tree." We see this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-38.htm">Acts 2:38</a>, where he exhorts his hearers to repent and be baptized, and adds the promise, "and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost;" and again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/2-39.htm">Acts 2:39</a>, where he observes, "The promise belongs to you and to your children, and to all that are afar off (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;), as many as the Lord our God will call." For if not only the children of the apostle's contemporaries, but also those that were afar off - i.e., not foreign Jews, but the far-off heathen - were to participate in the gift of the Holy Spirit, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit which commenced at Pentecost must continue as long as the Lord shall receive into His kingdom those who re still standing afar off, i.e., until the fulness of the Gentiles shall have entered the kingdom of God. See Hengstenberg, Christology, i. pp. 326ff. transl., where further reasons are adduced for taking this to be the allusion in the prophecy.<p>There is far greater diversity in the opinions entertained as to the fulfilment of <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30-32</a> : some thinking of the destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (Grotius, Turretius, and the Socinians); and others of judgments upon the enemies of the covenant nation shortly after the return from the Babylonian exile (Ephr. Syr. and others); others, again, of the last judgment (Tertull., Theod., Crus.), or the destruction of Jerusalem and the last judgment (Chrys.). Of all these views, those which refer to events occurring before the Christian era are irreconcilable with the context, according to which the day of the Lord will come after the outpouring of the Spirit of God. Even the wonders connected with the death of Christ and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles, of which some have thought, cannot properly be taken into account, although the marvellous phenomena occurring at the death of Christ - the darkening of the sun, the shaking of the earth, and the rending of the rocks - were harbingers of the approaching judgment, and were recognised by the &#x3bf;&#787;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; as warnings to repent, and so escape from the judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/27-45.htm">Matthew 27:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-51.htm">Matthew 27:51</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/23-44.htm">Luke 23:44</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/23-48.htm">Luke 23:48</a>). For the signs in heaven and earth that are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-30.htm">Joel 2:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-31.htm">Joel 2:31</a> were to take place before the coming of the terrible day of the Lord, which would dawn after the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon all flesh, and which came, as history teaches, upon the Jewish nation that had rejected its Saviour on the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and upon the Gentile world-power in the destruction of the Roman empire, and from that time forward breaks in constant succession upon one Gentile nation after another, until all the ungodly powers of this world shall be overthrown (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-2.htm">Joel 3:2</a>). On account of this internal connection between the day of Jehovah and the outpouring of the Spirit upon the church of the Lord, Peter also quoted vv. 30-32 of this prophecy, for the purpose of impressing upon the hearts of all the hearers of his address the admonition, "Save yourselves from this perverse generation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-40.htm">Acts 2:40</a>), and also of pointing out the way of deliverance from the threatening judgment to all who were willing to be saved. </body></html>
