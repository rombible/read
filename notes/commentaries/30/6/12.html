The conception of oppression, luxury, and pride being the forerunners of prosperity and peace is anomalous. The idea is, that that which should have insured the stability of the state, the embodiment of its conscience, had been turned into narcotic poison—the self-satisfaction of personal greed. <span class= "ital">Rôsh,</span> the Hebrew for “gall,” is a poisonous kind of plant with bitter taste, and resembling, according to Jerome, stalks of grass, and propagating itself with such rapidity that it is difficult to exterminate it.

So impossible is it that ye Israelites should continue to prosper, while ye remain thus sinful.” — Bishop Hall. Or, “as horses and oxen are useless in such places, so are ye evidently useless to God.” — Grotius. Several other interpretations are given of this obscure verse. Mr. Scott’s is, “It was as perilous to endeavour to reform the people as it would be to ride a race on the top of a craggy rock, where both horses and horsemen would be in danger of being killed; and as vain as to plough there with oxen, when no impression could be made or increase expected.” <span class="ital">For ye have turned judgment into gall, </span>&c. — Ye have rendered the administration of public justice as bitter as gall, and <span class="ital">the fruit of righteousness, </span>or the observance of religious ceremonies, as poisonous as <span class="ital">hemlock.</span> <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-14 How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us.

The horse's hoofs or his limbs would be broken; the plowing-gear would be destroyed. The prophet gains the attention by the question. What then? they ask. The answer is implied by the for, which follows. Ye are they, who are so doing. As absurd is it to seek gain from injustice and oppression, to which God had annexed loss and woe, temporal and eternal. More easy to change the course of nature or the use of things of nature, than the course of God's Providence or the laws of His just retribution. They had changed the sweet laws of "justice" and equity "into" the "gall" of oppression, and the healthful "fruit of righteousness," whereof they had received the seed from God, into the life-destroying poison of sin. Better to have "plowed" the rock "with oxen" for food! For now, where they looked for prosperity, they found not barrenness, but death.<p>Others  understand the question as the taunt of unbelievers, trusting in the strength of Samaria, that when horses should run on their rocky eminence, or the oxen plow there, then might an enemy look for gain from investing the hill of Samaria. "Shall things which are against nature be done?" "Yes," the prophet then would answer, "for ye have done against nature yourselves. Ye, have "changed justice," the solace of the oppressed, "into wormwood," the bitterness of oppression. Well may what ye think above the laws of physical nature be done, when ye have violated the laws of moral nature. Well may the less thing be done, your destruction, secure as by nature ye seem, when ye have done the greater, violating the laws of the God of nature." Amos, however, when he refers to the sayings of the unbelievers, distinguishes them from his own. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. In turning "judgment (justice) into gall (poison), and &#8230; righteousness into hemlock" (or wormwood, bitter and noxious), ye act as perversely as if one were to make "horses run upon the rock" or to "plough with oxen there" [Maurer]. As horses and oxen are useless on a rock, so ye are incapable of fulfilling justice [Grotius]. Ye impede the course of God's benefits, because ye are as it were a hard rock on which His favor cannot run.

Before it burneth fire, and behind it flameth flame: the land before it as the garden of Eden, and behind it like a desolate wilderness; and even that which escaped did not remain to it." With four words, expressing the idea of darkness and obscurity, the day of Jehovah is described as a day of the manifestation of judgment. The words &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; &#1506;&#1504;&#1503; &#1493;&#1506;&#1512;&#1508;&#1500; are applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11</a> to the cloudy darkness in which Mount Sinai was enveloped, when Jehovah came down upon it in the fire; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-22.htm">Exodus 10:22</a>, the darkness which fell upon Egypt as the ninth plague is called &#1488;&#1508;&#1500;&#1492;. &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1512; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; does not belong to what precedes, nor does it mean blackness or twilight (as Ewald and some Rabbins suppose), but "the morning dawn." The subject to pa&#770;rus (spread) is neither yo&#772;m (day), which precedes it, nor &#8219;am (people), which follows; for neither of these yields a suitable thought at all. The subject is left indefinite: "like morning dawn is it spread over the mountains." The prophet's meaning is evident enough from what follows. He clearly refers to the bright glimmer or splendour which is seen in the sky as a swarm of locusts approaches, from the reflection of the sun's rays from their wings.<p>(Note: The following is the account given by the Portuguese monk Francis Alvarez, in his Journey through Abyssinia (Oedmann, Vermischte Sammlungen, vi. p. 75): "The day before the arrival of the locusts we could infer that they were coming, from a yellow reflection in the sky, proceeding from their yellow wings. As soon as this light appeared, no one had the slightest doubt that an enormous swarm of locusts was approaching." He also says, that during his stay in the town of Barua he himself saw this phenomenon, and that so vividly, that even the earth had a yellow colour from the reflection. The next day a swarm of locusts came.)<p>With &#1506;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489; &#1493;&#1506;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1501; (a people great and strong) we must consider the verb &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; (cometh) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/10-1.htm">Exodus 10:1</a> as still retaining its force. Yo&#772;m (day) and &#8219;a&#770;m (people) have the same predicate, because the army of locusts carries away the day, and makes it into a day of cloudy darkness. The darkening of the earth is mentioned in connection with the Egyptian plague of locusts in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/10-15.htm">Exodus 10:15</a>, and is confirmed by many witnesses (see the comm. on Ex. l.c.). The fire and the flame which go both before and behind the great and strong people, viz., the locusts, cannot be understood as referring to the brilliant light kindled as it were by the morning dawn, which proceeds from the fiery armies of the vengeance of God, i.e., the locusts (Umbreit), nor merely to the burning heat of the drought by which everything is consumed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>); but this burning heat is heightened here into devouring flames of fire, which accompany the appearing of God as He comes to judgment at the head of His army, after the analogy of the fiery phenomena connected with the previous manifestations of God, both in Egypt, where a terrible hail fell upon the land before the plague of locusts, accompanied by thunder and balls of fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-23.htm">Exodus 9:23-24</a>), and also at Sinai, upon which the Lord came down amidst thunder and lightning, and spoke to the people out of the fire (<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-11.htm">Deuteronomy 4:11-12</a>). The land, which had previously resembled the garden of paradise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>), was changed in consequence into a desolate wilderness. &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;&#1492; does not mean escape or deliverance, either here or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-17.htm">Obadiah 1:17</a>, but simply that which has run away or escaped. Here it signifies that part of the land which has escaped the devastation; for it is quite contrary to the usage of the language to refer &#1500;&#1493;, as most commentators do, to the swarm of locusts, from which there is no escape, no deliverance (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-14.htm">2 Samuel 15:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/21-17.htm">Judges 21:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezra/9-13.htm">Ezra 9:13</a>, in all of which &#1500; refers to the subject, to which the thing that escaped was assigned). Consequently &#1500;&#1493; can only refer to &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;. The perfect &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; stands related to &#1488;&#1495;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, according to which the swarm of locusts had already completed the devastation. </body></html>
