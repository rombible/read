God is said to "raise up," when, by His Providence or His grace, He calls forth those who had not been called before, for the office for which He designs them. Thus, He raised up judges Jdg 2:16-18, delivers <a href="http://biblehub.com/judges/3-9.htm">Judges 3:9-15</a>, prophets , Nazarites <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/2-11.htm">Amos 2:11</a>, priests <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-35.htm">1 Samuel 2:35</a>, kings <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_samuel/7-8.htm">2 Samuel 7:8</a>, calling each separately to perform what He gave them in charge. So He is said to "raise up" even the evil ministers of His good Will, whom, in the course of His Providence, He allows to raise themselves up aloft to that eminence, so often as, in fulfilling their own bad will, they bring about, or are examples of, His righteous judgment. Thus God "raised up Hadad" as "an adversary" <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a> to Solomon, and again Rezon <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-23.htm">1 Kings 11:23</a>; and the Chaldees <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.<p>So again God says to Pharaoh, "For this have I raised thee up <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/9-16.htm">Exodus 9:16</a>, to show in thee My power." So here He says, "I will raise up against you a nation, and they shall afflict you from the entering in of Hamath." Israel, under Jeroboam II, had recovered a wider extent of territory, than had, in her northern portion, belonged to her since the better days of Solomon. Jeroboam "recovered Damascus and Hamath" <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-28.htm">2 Kings 14:28</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>, which belonged to "Judah, unto Israel. He restored," as God promised him by Jonah, "the coast of Israel from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain. The entering of Hamath" expresses the utmost northern boundary promised to Israel <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>. But this does not in itself express whether Hamath itself was included. Hamath however, and even Damascus itself, were incorporated in the bounds of Israel. The then great scourge of Israel had become part of its strength. Southward, Ammon and even Moab, had been taken into its borders. All the country on the other side of Jordan was theirs from Hamath and Damascus to the south of the Dead Sea, a space including four degrees of Latitude, as much as from Portsmouth to Durham. Amos describes the extension of the kingdom of Israel in the self-same terms as the Book of Kings; only he names as the southern extremity, "the river of the wilderness," instead of "the sea of the wilderness." The sea of the wilderness, that is, the Dead Sea, might in itself be either its northern or its southern extremity. The word used by Amos, defines it to be the southern. For his use of the name, "river of the wilderness," implies:<p>(1) That it was a well-known boundary, a boundary as well-known to Israel on the south , "as the entering in of Hamath" was on the north.<p>(2) As a boundary-river, it must have been a river on the east of the Jordan, since Benjamin formed their boundary on the west of Jordan, and mountain passes, not rivers, separated them from it.<p>(3) From its name, 'river of the wilderness, or the Arabah," it must, in some important part of its course, have flowed in the 'Arabah.<p>The 'Arabah, (it is now well known,) is no other than that deep and remarkable depression, now called the Ghor, which extends from the lake of Gennesareth to the Red Sea . The Dead Sea itself is called by Moses too "the sea of the Arabah" <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-49.htm">Deuteronomy 4:49</a>, lying, as it does, in the middle of that depression, and dividing it into two, the valley of the Jordan above the Dead Sea, and the southern portion which extends uninterrupted from the Dead to the Red Sea; and which also (although Scripture has less occasion to speak of it) Moses calls the 'Arabah . A river, which fell from Moab into the Dead Sea without passing through the Arabah, would not be called "a river of the Arabah," but, at the most "a river of the sea of the Arabah." Now, besides the improbability that the name, "the river of the Arabah," should have been substituted for the familiar names, the Arnon or the Jabbok, the Arnon does not flow into the Arabah at all, the Jabbok is no way connected with the Dead Sea, the corresponding boundary in the Book of Kings. These were both boundary-rivers, the Jabbok having keen the northern limit of what Moab and Ammon lost to the Amorite; the Arnon being the northern border of Moab. But there is a third boundary-river which answers all the conditions.<p>Moab was bounded on the south by a river, which Isaiah calls "the brook of the willows," &#1506;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;  nachal &#8219;a&#770;ra&#770;b&#305;&#770;ym <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-7.htm">Isaiah 15:7</a>, across which he foretells that they should transport for safety all which they had of value. A river, now called in its upper part the Wadi-el-Ahsa, and then the Wadi-es-Safieh, which now too  "has more water than any south of the Yerka" (Jabbok), "divides the district of Kerek from that of Jebal, the ancient Gebalene" (that is, Moab from Idumaea). This river, after flowing from east to west and so forming a southern boundary to Moab, turns to the north in the Ghor or Arabah, and flows into the south extremity of the Dead Sea . This river then, answering to all the conditions, is doubtless that of which Amos spoke, and the boundary, which Jeroboam restored, included Moab also, (as in the most prosperous times of Israel,) since Moab's southern border was now his border.<p>Israel, then, had no enemy, west of the Euphrates. Their strength had also, of late, been increasing steadily. Jehoash had, at the promise of Elisha, thrice defeated the Syrians, and recovered cities which had been lost, probably on the west also of Jordan, in the heart of the kingdom of Israel. What Jehoash had begun, Jeroboam II, during a reign of 41 years, continued. prophets had foretold and defined the successes of both kings, and so had marked them out the more to be the gift of God. Israel ascribed it to himself; and now that the enemies, whom Israel had feared, were subdued, God says, "I will raise up an enemy, and they shall afflict thee from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness." The whole scene of their triumphs should be one scene of affliction and woe. This was fulfilled after some 45 years, at the invasion of Tiglath-pileser. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. from the entering in of Hamath&#8212;the point of entrance for an invading army (as Assyria) into Israel from the north; specified here, as Hamath had been just before subjugated by Jeroboam II (Am 6:2). Do not glory in your recently acquired city, for it shall be the starting-point for the foe to afflict you. How sad the contrast to the feast of Solomon attended by a congregation from this same Hamath, the most northern boundary of Israel, to the Nile, the river of Egypt, the most southern boundary!<p>unto the river of the wilderness&#8212;that is, to Kedron, which empties itself into the north bay of the Dead Sea below Jericho (2Ch 28:15), the southern boundary of the ten tribes (2Ki 14:25, "from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain") [Maurer]. To the river Nile, which skirts the Arabian wilderness and separates Egypt from Canaan [Grotius]. If this verse includes Judah, as well as Israel (compare Am 6:1, "Zion" and "Samaria"), Grotius' view is correct; and it agrees with 1Ki 8:65.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">But; </span> notwithstanding all your boasts and carnal confidences. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold; </span> observe and weigh well what is said. ir will raise up; awaken, call together, strengthen, succeed, and prosper in the attempt against you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A nation; </span> Pul hath, and Tiglath-pileser hath, or now doth, afflict and break you, but Shalmaneser shall utterly destroy you; if his strength were not enough of itself, mine arm should strengthen him to bring all your hopes to nought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">O house of Israel; </span> kingdom of the ten tribes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Saith the Lord the God of hosts; </span> who doth what he saith, who commands and it is done, whom none can resist. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They, </span> the Assyrians and their confederates, shall afflict you; distress you and press you hard on all sides, it shall be a great and a universal oppression of you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From the entering in of Hemath, </span> a city of Syria bordering on the land of Israel north-east, and was an inlet into Syria from the north of Canaan, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">unto the river of the wilderness, </span> which is Sichor, in the most south-west parts of Canaan towards Egypt.

The Assyrian nation, under its king, Shalmaneser; who invaded Israel, came up to Samaria, and after a three years' siege took it, and carried Israel captive into foreign lands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/17-5.htm">2 Kings 17:5</a>; <p>and they shall afflict you; by battles, sieges, forages, plunders, and burning of cities and towns, and putting the inhabitants to the sword: <p>from the entering in of Hamath unto the river of the wilderness; from Hamath the less, said by Josephus (q) and Jerom (r) to be called Epiphania, in their times, from Antiochus Epiphanes; it was at the entrance on the land of Israel, and at the northern border of it; so that "the river of the wilderness", whatever is meant by it, lay to the south; by which it appears that this affliction and distress would be very general, from one end of it to the other. Some, by this river, understand the river of Egypt, at the entrance of Egypt in the wilderness of Ethan; Sihor or Nile; which, Jarchi says, lay southwest of Israel, as Hamath lay northwest of it. And a late traveller (s) observes, that the south and southwest border of the tribe of Judah, containing within it the whole or the greatest part of what was called the "way of the spies", <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-1.htm">Numbers 21:1</a>; and afterwards Idumea, extended itself from the Elenitic gulf of the Red sea, along by that of Hieropolis, quite to the Nile westward; the Nile consequently, in this view and situation, either with regard to the barrenness of the Philistines, or to the position of it with respect to the land of promise, or to the river Euphrates, may, with propriety enough, be called "the river of the wilderness", <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>; as this district, which lies beyond the eastern or Asiatic banks of the Nile, from the parallel of Memphis, even to Pelusium, (the land of Goshen only excepted,) is all of it dry, barren, and inhospitable; or if the situation be more regarded, it may be called, as it is rendered by the Septuagint, the western torrent or river. Though some (t) take this to be the river Bosor or Bezor, that parts the tribes, of Judah and Simeon, and discharges itself into the Mediterranean between Gaza, or rather Majuma, and Anthedon. Though Kimchi takes this river to be the sea of the plain, the same with the Salt or Dead sea, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-17.htm">Deuteronomy 3:17</a>; which may seem likely, since Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel, under whom Amos prophesied, had restored the coast of Israel, from the entering of Hamath unto the sea of the plain, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-25.htm">2 Kings 14:25</a>; with which they were elevated, and of which they boasted; but now they should have affliction and distress in the same places, and which should extend as far. <p>(q) Antiqu. l. 1. c. 6. sect. 2.((r) Comment in Isa. x. fol. 20.

"Like the appearance of horses is its appearance; and like riding-horses, so do they run. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a>. Like rumbling of chariots on the tops of the mountains do they leap, like the crackling of flame which devours stubble, like a strong people equipped for conflict. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-6.htm">Joel 2:6</a>. Before it nations tremble; all faces withdraw their redness." The comparison drawn between the appearance of the locusts and that of horses refers chiefly to the head, which, when closely examined, bears a strong resemblance to the head of a horse, as Theodoret has already observed; a fact which gave rise to their being called Heupferde (hay-horses) in German. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-4.htm">Joel 2:4</a> the rapidity of their motion is compared to the running of riding-horses (pa&#770;ra&#770;sh&#305;&#772;m); and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-5.htm">Joel 2:5</a> the noise caused by their springing motion to the rattling of chariots, the small two-wheeled war-chariots of the ancients, when driven rapidly over the rough mountain roads. The noise caused by their devouring the plants and shrubs is also compared to the burning of a flame over a stubble-field that has been set on fire, and their approach to the advance of a war force equipped for conflict. (Compare the adoption and further expansion of these similes in <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/9-7.htm">Revelation 9:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-9.htm">Revelation 9:9</a>). At the sight of this terrible army of God the nations tremble, so that their faces grow pale. &#8219;Amm&#305;&#772;m means neither people (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-28.htm">1 Kings 22:28</a>) nor the tribes of Israel, but nations generally. Joel is no doubt depicting something more here than the devastation caused by the locusts in his own day. There are differences of opinion as to the rendering of the second hemistich, which Nahum repeats in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-11.htm">Joel 2:11</a>. The combination of &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; with &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, a pot (Chald., Syr., Jer., Luth., and others), is untenable, since &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; comes from &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1512;, to break in pieces, whereas &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512; ( equals  &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;) is from the root &#1508;&#1488;&#1512;, piel, to adorn, beautify, or glorify; so that the rendering, "they gather redness," i.e., glow with fear, which has an actual but not a grammatical support in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-8.htm">Isaiah 13:8</a>, is evidently worthless. We therefore understand &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, as Ab. Esr., Abul Wal., and others have done, in the sense of elegantia, nitor, pulchritudo, and as referring to the splendour or healthy ruddiness of the cheeks, and take &#1511;&#1489;&#1468;&#1509; ekat dn as an intensive form of &#1511;&#1489;&#1509;, in the sense of drawing into one's self, or withdrawing, inasmuch as fear and anguish cause the blood to fly from the face and extremities to the inward parts of the body. For the fact of the face turning pale with terror, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/30-6.htm">Jeremiah 30:6</a>. </body></html>
