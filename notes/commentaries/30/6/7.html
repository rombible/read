Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures.

Jerome: "Ye who are first in riches, shall, the first, endure the yoke of captivity, as it is in Ezekiel, 'begin from My sanctuary' <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/9-6.htm">Ezekiel 9:6</a>, that is, from the destruction of the Temple which is holy. For 'mighty men shall be mightily tormented' (Wisdom <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>); and, 'to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more' <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-48.htm">Luke 12:48</a>."<p>And the banquet - Probably, "the screech." The root, &#1512;&#1491;&#1505;&#1495;  radsach, whose consonants contain most of those of our screech, signifies the loud sharp cry, which the mind cannot control, either in revelry or distress. Here it is probably, the drunken scream, or reckless cry of revelry, whose senseless shrillness is more piercing, in its way, than the scream of distress, of which Jeremiah Jer 16:5 uses it. For it is the scream of the death of the soul. Amos seems to have purposely joined together similar harsh sibilants or guttural sounds in order the more to express the harshness of that scream of luxurious self-indulgence. &#1505;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; &#1502;&#1512;&#1494;&#1495;  m&#305;&#770;rezach seruch&#305;&#770;ym, the screech of the outstretched." Of this he says, "it shall depart," and forever. "In that very day all his thoughts perish" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/146-4.htm">Psalm 146:4</a>. It shall "depart;" but by what should it be replaced to those to whom it was their god and their all?

That is, these men, who were the first and chief in the nation, who would not believe the day of Israel's captivity would ever come; or, however, had very distant apprehensions of it; but indulged and gratified their several senses of tasting, hearing, smelling, in a carnal way, and had no sympathy with and compassion upon their afflicted brethren; these should be the first the enemy should lay hold upon, and carry captive; as we find the royal family, the princes and nobles, the courtiers and chief tradesmen, were the first that were carried captive of the Jews, in Jeconiah's captivity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-12.htm">2 Kings 24:12</a>; <p>and the banquet of them that stretched themselves shall be removed; that stretched themselves upon couches, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-4.htm">Amos 6:4</a>; they shall have no more banquets or feasting bouts to attend to, by stretching themselves out, and lying upon couches at their ease; these shall be taken from them; and be glad of bread and water in an enemy's country, without a couch to recline upon. Some understand this of a funeral banquet, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-5.htm">Jeremiah 16:5</a>; and so the sense is, that when they die, they shall not have that honour done to their memory, as to have a funeral feast provided for those that attend their burial, as was customary. Kimchi interprets it, "the mourning of such shall draw nigh" (b); and according to his father, Joseph Kimchi, the word in the Arabic language signifies to lift up the voice, either in mourning or joy; and so may signify, that as all feasts, and the joy that attends them, should be removed, which is the sense of the Targum, instead of that, mourning should take place; or they should be deprived of the common ceremony at death of mourning men and women. <p>(b) "ad veniet", Munster; "appropinquabit", Mercerus; "veniet", Calvin.

The grains have mouldered under their clods, the storehouses are desolate, the barns have fallen down; because the corn is destroyed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>. How the cattle groan! the herds of oxen are bewildered, for no pasture was left for them; even the flocks of sheep suffer." As a proof that the day of the Lord is coming like a devastation from the Almighty, the prophet points in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-16.htm">Joel 1:16</a> to the fact that the food is taken away before their eyes, and therewith all joy and exulting from the house of God. "The food of the sinners perishes before their eyes, since the crops they looked for are snatched away from their hands, and the locust anticipates the reaper" (Jerome). &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, food as the means of sustenance; according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>, corn, new wine, and oil. The joy is thereby taken from the house of Jehovah, inasmuch as, when the crops are destroyed, neither first-fruits nor thank-offerings can be brought to the sanctuary to be eaten there at joyful meals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10-11</a>). And the calamity became all the more lamentable, from the fact that, in consequence of a terrible drought, the seed perished in the earth, and consequently the prospect of a crop the following year entirely disappeared. The prophet refers to this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>, which has been rendered in extremely different ways by the lxx, Chald., and Vulg., on account of the &#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, and &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; (compare Pococke, ad h. l.). &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to moulder away, or, as the injury was caused by dryness and heat, to dry up; it is used here of grains of corn which lose their germinating power, from the Arabic &#8219;bs, to become dry or withered, and the Chaldee &#1506;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to get mouldy. Perudo&#772;th, in Syriac, grains of corn sowed broadcast, probably from pa&#770;rad, to scatter about. Megra&#770;pho&#772;th, according to Ab. Esr., clods of earth (compare Arab. jurf, gleba terrai), from ga&#770;raph, to wash away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>) a detached piece of earth. If the seed-corn loses its germinating power beneath the clod, no corn-harvest can be looked for. The storehouses ('o&#772;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>) moulder away, and the barns (mammegura&#770;h with dag. dirim.  equals  megu&#772;ra&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>) fall, tumble to pieces, because being useless they are not kept in proper condition. The drought also deprives the cattle of their pasture, so that the herds of oxen and flocks of sheep groan and suffer with the rest from the calamity. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, niphal, to be bewildered with fear. 'Ashe&#772;m, to expiate, to suffer the consequences of men's sin.<p>The fact, that even irrational creatures suffer along with men, impels the prophet to pray for help to the Lord, who helps both man and beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>. "To Thee, O Jehovah, do I:cry: for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has consumed all the trees of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>. Even the beasts of the field cry unto Thee; for the water-brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness." Fire and flame are the terms used by the prophet to denote the burning heat of the drought, which consumes the meadows, and even scorches up the trees. This is very obvious from the drying up of the water-brooks (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-5.htm">Jeremiah 14:5-6</a>.
