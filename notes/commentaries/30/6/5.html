Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put the evil day far from them, find it nearest to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That chant to the voice of the lyre - Accompanying "the voice of the lyre" with the human voice; giving vocal expression and utterance to what the instrumental music spoke without words. The word, which Amos alone uses in this one place, describes probably  a hurried flow of unmeaning, unconsidered words, in which the rhythm of words and music was everything, the sense, nothing; much like most glees.<p>The English margin "quaver" has also some foundation in the root, but does not suit the idiom so well, which expresses that the act was something done "to the voice of the lyre," accompanying the music, not altering the music itself. In fact, they would go together. An artificial, effeminate music which should relax the soul, frittering the melody, and displacing the power and majesty of divine harmony by tricks of art, and giddy, thoughtless, heartless, soulless versifying would be meet company. Debased music is a mark of a nation's decay, and promotes it. The Hebrew music seems to have been very simple; and singing appears to have been reserved almost exclusively for solemn occasions, the temple-service, or the greeting of victory <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/18-7.htm">1 Samuel 18:7</a>. "Singing men and singing women" were part of the state of David and Solomon <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-35.htm">2 Samuel 19:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-8.htm">Ecclesiastes 2:8</a>. Else the music at the feasts of the rich appears rather to be mentioned with blame <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-9.htm">Isaiah 24:9</a>. Songs they had <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-20.htm">Proverbs 25:20</a>; but the songs, for which the Hebrew exiles were celebrated, and which their Babylonian masters required them to sing, "the songs of Zion" <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/137-3.htm">Psalm 137:3-4</a>, were the hymns of the temple, "the Lord's song."<p>And invent to themselves instruments of music - The same pains, which David employed on music to the honor of God, they employed on their light, enervating unmeaningful music, and, if they were in earnest enough, justified their inventions by the example of David. Much as people have justified our degraded, sensualizing, immodest dancing, by the religious dancing of Holy Scripture! The word can mean no other than devised. David then did "devise" and "invent" instruments of music for the service of God. He introduced into the temple-service the use of the stringed instruments, the "kinnor," (the "lyre") and the "nebel" (the "harp") in addition to the cymbals. Whence these, in contrast with the trumpets, are called "the instruments of David" (<a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-26.htm">2 Chronicles 29:26</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/29-25.htm">2 Chronicles 29:25</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-16.htm">1 Chronicles 15:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19-21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-24.htm">1 Chronicles 15:24</a>). Probably, in adapting them to the temple-service, he, in some way, improved the existing instrument; having been, in early youth, remarkable for his skill upon the harp <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-16.htm">1 Samuel 16:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-18.htm">1 Samuel 16:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-23.htm">1 Samuel 16:23</a>. As he elevated the character and powers of the, perhaps rude, instrument which he found, and suited it to the service of God, so these people refined it doubtless, as they thought, and suited it for the service of luxury and sensuality. But what harm, they thought, in amending the music of their day, since so did David? <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5. chant&#8212;literally, "mark distinct sounds and tones."<p>viol&#8212;the lyre, or lute.<p>invent &#8230; instruments &#8230; like David&#8212;They fancy they equal David in musical skill (1Ch 23:5; Ne 12:36). They defend their luxurious passion for music by his example: forgetting that he pursued this study when at peace and free from danger, and that for the praise of God; but they pursue for their own self-gratification, and that when God is angry and ruin is imminent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/amos/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Woe to them that, in a time of deepest morning, do entertain themselves with songs, and with greatest skill sing to their musical instruments, as if they had no greater thing to mind! <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Viol; </span> or lute, or gittern, one kind put for every one used in their feastings at this time of Amos. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Invent to themselves instruments of music; </span> not content with known, old-fashioned music, they find out new instruments, new songs and tunes. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Like David; </span> in imitation of David, as they profanely pretend, or else emulating his skill, and preferring their own feast songs and music before his temple music and songs.

The comparison rather suggests that the music for which David at this time was chiefly remembered was of a secular kind (cf., of Solomon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/10-12.htm" title="And the king made of the almug trees pillars for the house of the LORD, and for the king's house, harps also and psalteries for singers: there came no such almug trees, nor were seen to this day.">1 Kings 10:12</a> where ‘singers’ is not the term used technically in later writings of the Temple-singers), but it is obviously not inconsistent with the tradition embodied in the Chronicles that he cultivated sacred music as well.

This verse does not contain words which the priests are to speak, so that we should have to supply &#1500;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;, like the Syriac and others, but words of the prophet himself, with which he justifies the appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>. &#1500;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; is the time of the judgment, which has fallen upon the land and people through the devastation by the locusts. This "day" is the beginning of the approaching day of Jehovah, which will come like a devastation from the Almighty. Yo&#772;m Yeho&#772;va&#770;h is the great day of judgment upon all ungodly powers, when God, as the almighty ruler of the world, brings down and destroys everything that has exalted itself against Him; thus making the history of the world, through His rule over all creatures in heaven and earth, into a continuous judgment, which will conclude at the end of this course of the world with a great and universal act of judgment, through which everything that has been brought to eternity by the stream of time unjudged and unadjusted, will be judged and adjusted once for all, to bring to an end the whole development of the world in accordance with its divine appointment, and perfect the kingdom of God by the annihilation of all its foes. (Compare the magnificent description of this day of the Lord in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm">Isaiah 2:12-21</a>.) And accordingly this particular judgment - through which Jehovah on the one hand chastises His people for their sins, and on the other hand destroys the enemies of His kingdom - forms one element of the day of Jehovah; and each of these separate judgment is a coming of that day, and a sign of His drawing near. This day Joel saw in the judgment that came upon Judah in his time, kesho&#772;d misshaddai, lit., like a devastation from the Almighty, - a play upon the words (since sho&#772;d and shaddai both come from sha&#770;dad), which Rckert renders, though somewhat too freely, by wie ein Graussen vom grossen Gott. &#1499; is the so-called &#1499; veritatis, expressing a comparison between the individual and its genus or its idea.
