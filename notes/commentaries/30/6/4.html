Here is a description of the pride, security, and sensuality, for which God would reckon. Careless sinners are every where in danger; but those at ease in Zion, who are stupid, vainly confident, and abusing their privileges, are in the greatest danger. Yet many fancy themselves the people of God, who are living in sin, and in conformity to the world. But the examples of others' ruin forbid us to be secure. Those who are set upon their pleasures are commonly careless of the troubles of others, but this is great offence to God. Those who placed their happiness in the pleasures of sense, and set their hearts upon them, shall be deprived of those pleasures. Those who try to put the evil day far from them, find it nearest to them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That lie upon beds (that is, sofas) of ivory - that is, probably inlaid with ivory. The word might, in itself, express either the bed, in which they slept by night, or the divan, on which the Easterns lay at their meals; "and stretch themselves," literally, "are poured" out , stretching their listless length, dissolved, unnerved, in luxury and sloth, "upon their couches," perhaps under an awning: "and eat the lambs," probably "fatted lambs (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-14.htm">Deuteronomy 32:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-20.htm">Psalm 37:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/15-9.htm">1 Samuel 15:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-40.htm">Jeremiah 51:40</a>), out of the flock," chosen, selected out of it as the best, and "calves out of the midst of the stall;" that is, the place where they were tied up (as the word means) to be fatted. They were stall-fed, as we say, and these people had the best chosen for them.<p>: "He shews how they 'draw nigh the seat of violence.' They lay on beds or couches of ivory, and expended thereon the money wherewith their poor brethren were to be fed. Go now, I say not into the houses of nobles, but into any house of any rich man, see the gilded and worked couches, curtains woven of silk and gold, and walls covered with gold, while the poor of Christ are naked, shivering, shriveled with hunger. Yet stranger is it, that while this is everywhere, scarce anywhere is there who now blames it. Now I say, for there were formerly. 'Ye array,' Ambrose says , 'walls with gold, men ye bare. The naked cries before your door and you neglect him; and are careful with what marbles you clothe your pavement. The poor seeketh money, and hath it not; man asketh for bread, and thy horse champeth gold. Thou delightest in costly ornaments, while others have not meal. What judgment thou heapest on thyself, thou man of wealth! Miserable, who hast power to keep so many souls from death, and hast not the will! The jewel of thy ring could maintain in life a whole population.'

That were made of it, or inlaid with it, or covered with it, as the Targum; nor was it improbable that these were made wholly of ivory, for such beds we read of: Timaeus says (r), the Agrigentines had beds entirely made of ivory; and Horace (s) also speaks of such beds: and if any credit can be given to the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/50-1.htm">Genesis 50:1</a>. Joseph made his father Jacob to lie on a bed of ivory. Indeed, the Latin interpreters of these Targums render it a cedar bed; but Buxtorf (t) conjectures that ivory is meant by the word used; and so Bochart (u) translates it; on these they lay either for sleep and rest, or to eat their meals; <p>and stretch themselves upon their couches; for the same purposes, living in great splendour, and indulging themselves in ease and sloth; as it was the custom of the eastern countries, and is of the Arabs now; that they make little or no use of chairs, but either sitting cross legged, or lying at length, have couches to lie on at their meals; and when they indulge to ease, they cover or spread their floors with carpets, which for the most part are of the richest materials. Along the sides of the wall or floor, a range of narrow beds or mattresses is often placed upon these carpets; and, for their further ease and convenience, several velvet or damask bolsters are placed upon these, or mattresses (w), to lean upon, and take their ease; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-18.htm">Ezekiel 13:18</a>; and thus, and in some such like manner, did the principal men of the people of Israel indulge themselves. Some render it, "abound with superfluities"; the Septuagint and Vulgate Latin versions, "are lascivious"; and the Arabic version, "burn in lust"; and so some of the Jewish writers interpret it of their committing adulteries, and all uncleanness, on their beds and couches; <p>and eat the lambs out of the flock; pick the best and fattest of them for their use: so the Targum, <p>"eat the fat of the sheep:'' <p>and the calves out of the midst of the stall; where they are put, and kept to be fattened; from thence they took what they liked best, and perhaps not out of theft own flocks and stalls, but out of others, and with which they pampered themselves to excess. <p>(r) Apud Aelian.

The prophet therefore proceeds to call upon the priests to offer to the Lord penitential supplication day and night in the temple, and to call the elders and all the people to observe a day of fasting, penitence, and prayer; and then offers supplication himself to the Lord to have compassion upon them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>). From the motive assigned for this appeal, we may also see that a terrible drought had been associated with the devastation by the locusts, from which both man and beast had endured the most bitter suffering, and that Joel regarded this terrible calamity as a sign of the coming of the day of the Lord. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm">Joel 1:13</a>. "Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests; howl, ye servants of the altar; come, pass the night in sackcloth, ye servants of my God: for the meat-offering and drink-offering are withdrawn from the house of your God. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-14.htm">Joel 1:14</a>. Sanctify a fast, call out an assembly, assemble the elders, all ye inhabitants of the land, at the house of Jehovah your God, and cry to Jehovah." From what follows we must supply bassaqq&#305;&#772;m (with sackcloth) to chigru&#772; (gird yourselves). Gird yourselves with mourning apparel, i.e., put it on (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-8.htm">Joel 1:8</a>). In this they are to pass the night, to offer supplication day and night, or incessantly, standing between the altar and the porch (<a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-17.htm">Joel 2:17</a>). "Servants of my God," i.e., of the God whose prophet I am, and from whom I can promise you a hearing. The reason assigned for this appeal is the same as for the lamentation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-9.htm">Joel 1:9</a>. But it is not the priests only who are to pray incessantly to the Lord; the elders and all the people are to do the same. &#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; &#1510;&#1493;&#1501;, to sanctify a fast, i.e., to appoint a holy fast, a divine service of prayer connected with fasting. To this end the priests are to call an &#8219;a&#774;tsa&#770;ra&#770;h, i.e., a meeting of the congregation for religious worship. &#8219;Atsa&#770;ra&#770;h, or &#8219;a&#774;tsereth, &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, is synonymous with &#1502;&#1511;&#1512;&#1488; &#1511;&#1493;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-36.htm">Leviticus 23:36</a> (see the exposition of that passage). In what follows, &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497; &#1492; is attached &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3c2; to &#1494;&#1511;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;; and the latter is not a vocative, but an accusative of the object. On the other hand, &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; is an accus. loci, and dependent upon &#1488;&#1505;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;. &#1494;&#1506;&#1511;, to cry, used of loud and importunate prayer. It is only by this that destruction can still be averted. </body></html>
