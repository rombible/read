Nine have fallen victims. Fathers and brothers are all gone, and the uncle comes in as the funereal burner, to carry out the corpse to the pyre, and finds in the innermost parts of the house the tenth victim of the fell disease yet alive. A hurried word or two passes between them: “Is there yet another with thee?” and the answer comes, “Not one.” Then shall he say “Hush!” The lonely sufferer begins to curse the Lord for His judgments, or it may be he begins to call upon the Name of the Lord when it is too late, when, as a finishing touch of darkest gloom and despair, he is interrupted by a warning not to stir up Jehovah’s wrath in this day of His visitation by even mentioning His name. This and one other passage (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/31-12.htm" title="All the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Bethshan, and came to Jabesh, and burnt them there.">1Samuel 31:12</a>) imply that under special circumstances the Hebrews burned their dead. In this case pestilence made cremation a necessity. The references in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/16-14.htm" title="And they buried him in his own sepulchers, which he had made for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed which was filled with sweet odors and divers kinds of spices prepared by the apothecaries' are: and they made a very great burning for him.">2Chronicles 16:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/21-19.htm" title="And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for him, like the burning of his fathers.">2Chronicles 21:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-5.htm" title="But you shall die in peace: and with the burnings of your fathers, the former kings which were before you, so shall they burn odors for you; and they will lament you, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 34:5</a>, are to honorific burning of spices in memory of the dead.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/amos/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/6-9.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die....">Amos 6:9-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">If there remain ten men in one house, </span>&c. — Those that escape the hands of the enemy shall die by the pestilence. <span class="ital">And a man’s uncle </span>(or kinsman) <span class="ital">shall take him up — </span>Some friend or relation, whose duty it is to perform the last offices for the deceased, shall <span class="ital">take him up </span>directly <span class="ital">and burn him: </span>for so it should be rendered, and not, AND HE THAT <span class="ital">burneth him. </span>The meaning is, that he should not stay to perfume the body with rich ointments, as was the usual custom; nor should he bury it, but burn it to ashes, to prevent infection. <span class="ital">To bring out the bones out of the house, </span>&c. — Or rather, that <span class="ital">he may bring out, </span>&c., that is, that he may, as soon as possible, cleanse the house by the removal of the body. All that is said here, is strongly expressive of what is the case where a deadly pestilence rages. <span class="ital">And shall say unto him that is by the sides of the house — </span>Or near the house, out of which the bones are carried; <span class="ital">Is there any yet with thee — </span>Is there any yet living besides thyself belonging to this house? <span class="ital">And he shall say, No — </span>All the inhabitants of the house are dead. <span class="ital">Then shall he say, Hold thy tongue; for we may not make mention of the name of the Lord — </span>As this clause has no immediate connection with, or relation to, the negative answer contained in the preceding clause, it is to be supposed that when the person has given that answer, and said that there was none left alive in the house, he utters, as is natural, some prayer to God for mercy or deliverance; on which the other speaks to him in this manner: as much as to say, It is in vain now to pray, or make supplication; for God will not now hear us, but we also shall be cut off by this dreadful pestilence, as the rest have been. Archbishop Newcome puts a different sense on the last clause, thus: “Solitude shall reign in the house; and if one is left, he must be silent (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-3.htm" title="And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day, said the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every place; they shall cast them forth with silence.">Amos 8:3</a>) and retired, lest he be plundered of his scanty provisions.” <span class="ital">For behold, the Lord commandeth — </span>Gives forth his commands to the enemy, namely, the Assyrians, to come against Israel. <span class="ital">And he will smite the great house, and the little house, </span>&c. — People of all ranks, high and low, shall be sufferers in the common calamities.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-14 How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us.

They died, it seems, at once, and so probably through the plague, the common companion. of the siege. The prophet had before compared them to Sodom. It may be, that, in this mention of "ten men," he tacitly refers to the history of that destruction. Then God promised, not to destroy the city, if there were ten righteous in it <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-32.htm">Genesis 18:32</a>. Here were "ten left," not in one city, but in one house. Had God forgotten His loving-kindness? No! but, in Samaria, not even ten who "remained over," and so had survived after the chastisement had begun, turned to God. All then were to be taken or destroyed. The miseries of its three years' siege by Shalmanezer may be filled up from those of its earlier siege by Benhadad <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-24.htm">2 Kings 6:24-29</a>, or from those of Jerusalem. The sufferings of a siege are in proportion to the obstinacy of the defense; and Samaria resisted for twice the time in which Jerusalem was reduced by famine at its first captivity. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9.

The grains have mouldered under their clods, the storehouses are desolate, the barns have fallen down; because the corn is destroyed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>. How the cattle groan! the herds of oxen are bewildered, for no pasture was left for them; even the flocks of sheep suffer." As a proof that the day of the Lord is coming like a devastation from the Almighty, the prophet points in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-16.htm">Joel 1:16</a> to the fact that the food is taken away before their eyes, and therewith all joy and exulting from the house of God. "The food of the sinners perishes before their eyes, since the crops they looked for are snatched away from their hands, and the locust anticipates the reaper" (Jerome). &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, food as the means of sustenance; according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>, corn, new wine, and oil. The joy is thereby taken from the house of Jehovah, inasmuch as, when the crops are destroyed, neither first-fruits nor thank-offerings can be brought to the sanctuary to be eaten there at joyful meals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10-11</a>). And the calamity became all the more lamentable, from the fact that, in consequence of a terrible drought, the seed perished in the earth, and consequently the prospect of a crop the following year entirely disappeared. The prophet refers to this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>, which has been rendered in extremely different ways by the lxx, Chald., and Vulg., on account of the &#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, and &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; (compare Pococke, ad h. l.). &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to moulder away, or, as the injury was caused by dryness and heat, to dry up; it is used here of grains of corn which lose their germinating power, from the Arabic &#8219;bs, to become dry or withered, and the Chaldee &#1506;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to get mouldy. Perudo&#772;th, in Syriac, grains of corn sowed broadcast, probably from pa&#770;rad, to scatter about. Megra&#770;pho&#772;th, according to Ab. Esr., clods of earth (compare Arab. jurf, gleba terrai), from ga&#770;raph, to wash away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>) a detached piece of earth. If the seed-corn loses its germinating power beneath the clod, no corn-harvest can be looked for. The storehouses ('o&#772;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>) moulder away, and the barns (mammegura&#770;h with dag. dirim.  equals  megu&#772;ra&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>) fall, tumble to pieces, because being useless they are not kept in proper condition. The drought also deprives the cattle of their pasture, so that the herds of oxen and flocks of sheep groan and suffer with the rest from the calamity. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, niphal, to be bewildered with fear. 'Ashe&#772;m, to expiate, to suffer the consequences of men's sin.<p>The fact, that even irrational creatures suffer along with men, impels the prophet to pray for help to the Lord, who helps both man and beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>. "To Thee, O Jehovah, do I:cry: for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has consumed all the trees of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>. Even the beasts of the field cry unto Thee; for the water-brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness." Fire and flame are the terms used by the prophet to denote the burning heat of the drought, which consumes the meadows, and even scorches up the trees. This is very obvious from the drying up of the water-brooks (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-5.htm">Jeremiah 14:5-6</a>.
