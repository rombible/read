With the eternal unchangeable being of the Supreme Monarch stands contrasted “the excellency of Jacob,” the false futile glory which Jehovah abhors. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm" title="The LORD has sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will never forget any of their works.">Amos 8:7</a> the phrase is used for God Himself; not, however, in either passage God’s absolute perfection or objective glory, but the thoughts, sometimes wise, sometimes base, which men have entertained about Him. From the context we infer that the splendid shrine of Samaria, with its unacceptable offerings and calf-worship, is here meant. The reference to the coming destruction of buildings great and small (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-11.htm" title="For, behold, the LORD commands, and he will smite the great house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.">Amos 6:11</a>) lends colour to this interpretation. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm" title="You which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?">Amos 6:13</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/amos/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:8-14 How dreadful, how miserable, is the case of those whose eternal ruin the Lord himself has sworn; for he can execute his purpose, and none can alter it! Those hearts are wretchedly hardened that will not be brought to mention God's name, and to worship him, when the hand of God is gone out against them, when sickness and death are in their families. Those that will not be tilled as fields, shall be abandoned as rocks. When our services of God are soured with sin, his providences will justly be made bitter to us. Men should take warning not to harden their hearts, for those who walk in pride, God will destroy.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Lord God - He who alone is and who alone hath power, "hath sworn by Himself," literally, "by His soul;" as our "self" comes from the same root as "soul." Jerome: "So God saith in Isaiah, "Your new moons and your appointed feasts My soul hateth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-14.htm">Isaiah 1:14</a>; not that God hath a soul, but that He speaks after the way of human feelings. Nor is it any marvel that He condescends to speak of Himself, as having a soul, seeing He speaks of Himself as having the other members, feet, hands, bowels, which are less precious than the soul. In God the Father, the head, hands, and the rest are not members, but by these words a diversity of powers is expressed. So also by the soul is intended not a substance, but the inward affections, and the seat of thought whereby God indicates His Will." In truth, it is one and the same condescension in Almighty God, to use of Himself any words taken from our nature, our thoughts, acts, feelings, as those taken from the members of the body.<p>It is a yet greater condescension that God should confirm the truth of His word by an oath. For we call God to witness, lest, by reason of the vast reign of falsehood among people, we should be thought not to speak true. But for God to act as though He needed the assurance of an oath in order to be believed, is more condescending, than for Him to speak as though He had a soul or limbs, such as He gave to man. Yet God, "willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of His promise the immutability of His counsel, confirmed it by an oath. He swore by Himself saying, surely blessing I will bless thee" <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-17.htm">Hebrews 6:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/6-13.htm">Hebrews 6:13-14</a>. "Now," when Israel had, by apostasy, forfeited that blessing, and a portion of it was to be withdrawn from him, God, affirms by an oath that rejection of Israel. If the words, "by His soul," are emphatic, they relate to those attributes in God of which man's holy affections are an image. God's love, justice, righteousness, holiness, were concerned, to vindicate the oppressed and punish the oppressor. To these He appeals. Our oaths mean, "As God is true, and as He avenges untruth, this which I say is true." So God says, "As I am God, this is true." God then must cease to be God, if He did not hate oppression.<p>I abhor the excellency of Jacob - The word "excellency" is used of the Majesty of God Himself; then, since man's relation to God is his only real greatness, God speaks of Himself as "the Excellency of Jacob" <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-7.htm">Amos 8:7</a>; then of that "excellency" which God had given to "Jacob" <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/47-4.htm">Psalm 47:4</a>. That "excellency of their strength," He had forwarned them in the law, that He would break <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>. Now that Israel took as his own what he held from God, his "excellency" became pride, and God says, "I abhor" it, as a thing loathsome and abominable, and "hate his palaces." For they had been built, adorned, inhabited, filled with luxury, in the midst of, and out of, oppression and hard-hearted exaction. He calls them Jacob, perhaps as Hosea does <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-12.htm">Hosea 12:12</a>, to remind them of the poverty and low estate of their forefather, out of which God had raised them, and the faithfulness of their forefather in it, in contrast with their luxury and unfaithfulness.<p>Therefore (And) I will deliver up - Originally, "shut up" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-23.htm">Leviticus 14:23</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-4.htm">Leviticus 13:4-5</a>, ...), then, "shut up in the hands of," so that he should have no escape. Here, where the enemy is not spoken of, it may mean, that God "shut up the city," so that there should be no going out or coming in, in the straithess of the siege, whereupon follows the fearful description of the ravages of the pestilence. "The city" is, what was to them, above others, "the" city, the place of their luxury pride and boast, where lay their strength, Samaria. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. the excellency of Jacob&#8212;(Ps 47:4).

The grains have mouldered under their clods, the storehouses are desolate, the barns have fallen down; because the corn is destroyed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-18.htm">Joel 1:18</a>. How the cattle groan! the herds of oxen are bewildered, for no pasture was left for them; even the flocks of sheep suffer." As a proof that the day of the Lord is coming like a devastation from the Almighty, the prophet points in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-16.htm">Joel 1:16</a> to the fact that the food is taken away before their eyes, and therewith all joy and exulting from the house of God. "The food of the sinners perishes before their eyes, since the crops they looked for are snatched away from their hands, and the locust anticipates the reaper" (Jerome). &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;, food as the means of sustenance; according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>, corn, new wine, and oil. The joy is thereby taken from the house of Jehovah, inasmuch as, when the crops are destroyed, neither first-fruits nor thank-offerings can be brought to the sanctuary to be eaten there at joyful meals (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-6.htm">Deuteronomy 12:6-7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/16-10.htm">Deuteronomy 16:10-11</a>). And the calamity became all the more lamentable, from the fact that, in consequence of a terrible drought, the seed perished in the earth, and consequently the prospect of a crop the following year entirely disappeared. The prophet refers to this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-17.htm">Joel 1:17</a>, which has been rendered in extremely different ways by the lxx, Chald., and Vulg., on account of the &#788;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1514;, and &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1508;&#1493;&#1514; (compare Pococke, ad h. l.). &#1506;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to moulder away, or, as the injury was caused by dryness and heat, to dry up; it is used here of grains of corn which lose their germinating power, from the Arabic &#8219;bs, to become dry or withered, and the Chaldee &#1506;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, to get mouldy. Perudo&#772;th, in Syriac, grains of corn sowed broadcast, probably from pa&#770;rad, to scatter about. Megra&#770;pho&#772;th, according to Ab. Esr., clods of earth (compare Arab. jurf, gleba terrai), from ga&#770;raph, to wash away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-21.htm">Judges 5:21</a>) a detached piece of earth. If the seed-corn loses its germinating power beneath the clod, no corn-harvest can be looked for. The storehouses ('o&#772;tsa&#770;ro&#772;th; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/32-27.htm">2 Chronicles 32:27</a>) moulder away, and the barns (mammegura&#770;h with dag. dirim.  equals  megu&#772;ra&#770;h in <a href="https://biblehub.com/haggai/2-19.htm">Haggai 2:19</a>) fall, tumble to pieces, because being useless they are not kept in proper condition. The drought also deprives the cattle of their pasture, so that the herds of oxen and flocks of sheep groan and suffer with the rest from the calamity. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498;, niphal, to be bewildered with fear. 'Ashe&#772;m, to expiate, to suffer the consequences of men's sin.<p>The fact, that even irrational creatures suffer along with men, impels the prophet to pray for help to the Lord, who helps both man and beast (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/36-7.htm">Psalm 36:7</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-19.htm">Joel 1:19</a>. "To Thee, O Jehovah, do I:cry: for fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness, and flame has consumed all the trees of the field. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>. Even the beasts of the field cry unto Thee; for the water-brooks are dried up, and fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness." Fire and flame are the terms used by the prophet to denote the burning heat of the drought, which consumes the meadows, and even scorches up the trees. This is very obvious from the drying up of the water-brooks (in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>). For <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/1-20.htm">Joel 1:20</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/14-5.htm">Jeremiah 14:5-6</a>.
