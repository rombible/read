What is got and kept wrongfully, will not be kept long. Some are at ease, but there will come a day of visitation, and in that day, all they are proud of, and put confidence in, shall fail them. God will inquire into the sins of which they have been guilty in their houses, the robbery they have stored up, and the luxury in which they lived. The pomp and pleasantness of men's houses, do not fortify against God's judgments, but make sufferings the more grievous and vexatious. Yet a remnant, according to the election of grace, will be secured by our great and good Shepherd, as from the jaws of destruction, in the worst times.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/amos/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therefore thus saith the Lord God - There was no human redress. The oppressor was mighty, but mightier the Avenger of the poor. Man would not help; therefore God would. "An adversary" there shall be, "even round about the land;" literally, "An enemy, and around the land!" The prophets speaks, as seeing him. The abruptness tells how suddenly that enemy should come, and hem in the whole land on all sides. What an unity in their destruction! He sees one "enemy, and" him everywhere, all "around," encircling, encompassing, as with a net, their whole land, narrowing in, as he advanced, until it closed around and upon them. The corruption was universal, so should be the requital.<p>And he shall bring down thy strength from - (that is, away from) thee The word "bring down" implies a loftiness of pride which was to be brought low, as in Obadiah, "thence will I bring thee down" <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-4.htm">Obadiah 1:4</a>; and in Isaiah, "I will bring down their strength to the earth" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/63-6.htm">Isaiah 63:6</a>. But further, their strength was not only, as in former oppressions, to be "brought down," but "forth from thee. Thy palaces shall be spoiled;" those palaces, in which they had heaped up the spoils of the oppressed. Man's sins are, in God's Providence, the means of their punishment. "Woe to thee that spoilest and" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-1.htm">Isaiah 33:1</a> (that is, whereas) thou wert "not spoiled, and dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherowsly with thee! when thou perfectest, spoiling, thou shalt be spoiled; when thou accomplihest dealing treacherously, they shall deal treacherously with thee." Their spoiling should invite the spoiler, their oppressions should attract the oppressor and they, with all which they held to be their strength, should go "forth" into captivity.<p>Rib.: "The Lord will be justified in His sayings, and in His works, when He executeth judgment on 'us and shall be cleared,' even by the most unjust judges, 'when He is judged.' <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm">Psalm 51:4</a>. He cites the Ashdodites and Egyptians as judges, who were witnesses of His benefits to this people, that they might see how justly He punished them. And now the hardened Jews themselves, Turks and all Hagarenes, might be called to behold at once our iniquities, and 'the mercies of the Lord, that we are not consumed' <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-22.htm">Lamentations 3:22</a>. If these were gathered on the mountains of Samaria, and surveyed from aloft our sins, who worship Mammon and Vain-glory and Venus for God, doubtless the Name of God would through us be blasphemed among the pagan. 'Imagine yourselves withdrawn for a while to the summit of some lofty mountain,' says the blessed martyr Cyprian , 'view thence the face of things, as they lie beneath you, yourself free from contact of earth, cast your eyes hither and thither, and mark the turmoils of this billowy world.<p>You too, recalled to self-remembrance, will pity the world; and, made more thankful to God, will congratulate yourself with deeper joy that you have escaped it. See thou the ways obstructed by bandits, the seas infested by pirates, war diffused everywhere by the camp's bloodstained fierceness: a world reeking with mutual slaughter; and homicide, a crime in individuals, called virtue when worked by nations. Not innocence but the scale of its ferocity gains impunity for guilt. Turn thy eyes to the cities, thou wilt see a populated concourse more melancholy than any solitude.' This and much more which he says of the life of the Gentiles, how it fits in with our's, any can judge. What greater madness than that people, called to heavenly thrones, should cling to trifles of earth? immortal man glued to passing, perishable things people, redeemed by the Blood of Jesus Christ, for lucre wrong their brethren, redeemed by the same Price, the same Blood! No marvel then, that the Church is afflicted, and encompassed by unseen enemies, and her strength drawn down from her spoiled houses."<p>"Samaria is also every soul, which willeth to please man by whom it thinketh it may be holpen, rather than God, and, boasting itself to be Israel, yet worshipeth the golden calves, that is, gold, silver, honors, and pleasures. Let people alien from the light of the Gospel survey 'its tumults,' with what ardor of mind riches, pleasures are sought, how ambition is served, how restless and disturbed the soul is in catching at nothings, how forgetful of God the Creator and of heavenly things and of itself, how minded, as if it were to perish with the body! What tumults, when ambition bids one thing, lust another, avarice another, wrath another, and, like strong winds on the sea, strong, unbridled passions strive together! They 'know not to do right,' bad ends spoiling acts in themselves good. They 'treasure up violence,' whereas they ought to treasure up grace and charity against that Day when God shall judge the secrets of people. And when they ascribe to themselves any benefits of the divine mercy, and any works pleasing to God, which they may have done or do, what else do they than 'store up robbery?' So then the powers of the soul are "spoiled," when truths as to right action, once known and understood by the soul, fade and are obscure, when the memory retaineth nothing usefill, when the will is spoiled of virtues and yields to vicious affections." <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/amos/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11.

He fought against the angel, and overcame; wept, and prayed to Him: at Bethel he found Him, and there He talked with us. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-5.htm">Hosea 12:5</a>. And Jehovah, God of hosts, Jehovah is His remembrance." The name Jacob, which refers to the patriarch himself in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3</a>, forms the link between <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-2.htm">Hosea 12:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/12-3.htm">Hosea 12:3</a>. The Israelites, as descendants of Jacob, were to strive to imitate the example of their forefather. His striving hard for the birthright, and his wrestling with God, in which he conquered by prayer and supplication, are types and pledges of salvation to the tribes of Israel which bear his name.<p>(Note: "He shows what good Jacob received, and the son is named in the father: he calls to remembrance the ancient history, that they may see both the mercy of God towards Jacob, and his resolute firmness towards the Lord." - Jerome.)<p>&#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, a denom. from &#1506;&#1511;&#1489;, "to hold the heel"  equals  &#1488;&#1495;&#1494; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1511;&#1489; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-26.htm">Genesis 25:26</a>, which the prophet has in his mind, not "to overreach," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-3.htm">Jeremiah 9:3</a>. For the wrestling with God, mentioned in the second clause of the verse, proves most indisputably that Jacob's conduct is not held up before the people for a warning, as marked by cunning or deceit, as Umbreit and Hitzig suppose, but is set before them for their imitation, as an eager attempt to secure the birthright and the blessing connected with it. This shows at the same time, that the holding of the heel in the mother's womb is not quoted as a proof of the divine election of grace, and, in fact, that there is no reference at all to the circumstance, that "even when Jacob was still in his mother's womb, he did this not by his own strength, but by the mercy of God, who knows and loves those whom He has predestinated" (Jerome). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, is his manly strength (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-3.htm">Genesis 49:3</a>) he wrestled with God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/32-25.htm">Genesis 32:25-29</a>). This conflict (for the significance of which in relation to Jacob's spiritual life, see the discussion at Genesis l.c.) is more fully described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-4.htm">Hosea 12:4</a>, for the Israelites to imitate. &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1498; is the angel of Jehovah, the revealer of the invisible God (see the Commentary on the Pentateuch, pp. 118ff. transl.). &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500; is from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-29.htm">Genesis 32:29</a>. The explanatory clause, "he wept, and made supplication to Him" (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/32-27.htm">Genesis 32:27</a>), gives the nature of the conflict. It was a contest with the weapons of prayer; and with these he conquered. These weapons are also at the command of the Israelites, if they will only use them. The fruit of the victory was, that he (Jacob) found Him (God) at Bethel. This does not refer to the appearance of God to Jacob on his flight to Mesopotamia (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/28-11.htm">Genesis 28:11</a>), but to that recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/35-9.htm">Genesis 35:9</a>., when God confirmed his name of Israel, and renewed the promises of His blessing. And there, continues the prophet, He (God) spake with us; i.e., not there He speaks with us still, condemning by His prophets the idolatry at Bethel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/5-4.htm">Amos 5:4-5</a>), as Kimchi supposes; but, as the imperfect &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; corresponds to &#1497;&#1502;&#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;, "there did He speak to us through Jacob," i.e., what He there said to Jacob applies to us.<p>(Note: "Let it be carefully observed, that God is said to have talked at Bethel not with Jacob only, but with all his posterity. That is to say, the things which are here said to have been done by Jacob, and to have happened to him, had not regard to himself only, but to all the race that sprang from him, and were signs of the good fortune which they either would, or certainly might enjoy" (Lackemacher in Rosenmller's Scholia).)<p>The explanation of this is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/12-5.htm">Hosea 12:5</a>, where the name is recalled in which God revealed Himself to Moses, when He first called him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/3-15.htm">Exodus 3:15</a>), i.e., in which He made known to him His true nature. Yeho&#772;va&#770;h zikhro&#772; is taken literally from &#1494;&#1492; &#1494;&#1499;&#1512;&#1497; &#1500;&#1491;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;; but there the name Jehovah is still further defined by "the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob," here by "the God of hosts." This difference needs consideration. The Israelites in the time of Moses could only put full confidence in the divine call of Moses to be their deliverer out of the bondage of Egypt, on the ground that He who called him was the God who had manifested Himself to the patriarchs as the God of salvation; but for the Israelites of Hosea's time, the strength of their confidence in Jehovah arose from the fact that Jehovah was the God of hosts, i.e., the God who, because He commands the forces of heaven, both visible and invisible, rules with unrestricted omnipotence on earth as well as in heaven (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/1-3.htm">1 Samuel 1:3</a>). </body></html>
