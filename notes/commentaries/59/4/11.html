Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is to speak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great a restraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; let us not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule to those about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of the Lord. Go to now, is a call to any one to consider his conduct as being wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out of their plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God's blessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projects for futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour being scattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all the prosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for ever must be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We are always to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with cares and contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, and all we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish, and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; it will bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end. Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well as commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect to meditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit gross outward vices against light!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speak not evil one of another, brethren - It is not known to whom the apostle here particularly refers, nor is it necessary to know. It is probable that among those whom he addressed there were some who were less circumspect in regard to speaking of others than they should be, and perhaps this evil prevailed. There are few communities where such an injunction would not be proper at any time, and few churches where some might not be found to whom the exhortation would be appropriate. Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-31.htm">Ephesians 4:31</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm">1 Peter 2:1</a> note. The evil here referred to is that of talking against others - against their actions, their motives, their manner of living, their families, etc. Few things are more common in the world; nothing is more decidedly against the true spirit of religion.<p>He that speaketh evil of his brother - Referring here probably to Christian brother, or to a fellow Christian. The word may however be used in a larger sense to denote anyone - a brother of the human race. Religion forbids both, and would restrain us from all evil speaking against any human being.<p>And judgeth his brother - His motives, or his conduct. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a>.<p>Speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law - Instead of manifesting the feelings of a brother he sets himself up as judge, and not only a judge of his brother, but a judge of the law. The law here referred to is probably the law of Christ, or the rule which all Christians profess to obey. It is that which James elsewhere calls the "law of liberty," (Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm">James 1:25</a>) the law which released men from the servitude of the Jewish rites, and gave them liberty to worship God without the restraint and bondage <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-10.htm">Acts 15:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/galatians/4-21.htm">Galatians 4:21-31</a> implied in that ancient system of worship; and the law by which it was contemplated that they should be free from sin. It is not absolutely certain to what the apostle refers here, but it would seem probable that it is to some course of conduct which one portion of the church felt they were at liberty to follow, but which another portion regarded as wrong, and for which they censured them.<p>The explanation which will best suit the expressions here used, is that which supposes that it refers to some difference of opinion which existed among Christians, especially among those of Jewish origin, about the binding nature of the Jewish laws, in regard to circumcision, to holy days, to ceremonial observances, to the distinctions of meats, etc. A part regarded the law on these subjects as still binding, another portion supposed that the obligation in regard to these matters had ceased by the introduction of the gospel. Those who regarded the obligation of the Mosaic law as still binding, would of course judge their brethren, and regard them as guilty of a disregard of the law of God by their conduct. We know that differences of opinion on these points gave rise to contentions, and to the formation of parties in the church, and that it required all the wisdom of Paul and of the other apostles to hush the contending elements to peace.<p>Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/2-16.htm">Colossians 2:16-18</a>. To some such source of contention the apostle doubtless refers here; and the meaning probably is, that they who held the opinion that all the Jewish ceremonial laws were still binding on Christians, and who judged and condemned their brethren who did not observe them, by such a course judged and condemned "the law of liberty" under which they acted - the law of Christianity that had abolished the ceremonial observances, and released men from their obligation. The judgment which they passed, therefore, was not only on their brethren, but was on that law of Christianity which had given greater liberty of conscience, and which was intended to abolish the obligation of the Jewish ritual. The same thing now occurs when we judge others for a course which their consciences approve, because they do not deem it necessary to comply with all the rules which we think to be binding.<p>Not a few of the harsh judgments which one class of religionists pronounce on others, are in fact judgments on the laws of Christ. We set up our own standards, or our own interpretations, and then we judge others for not complying with them, when in fact they may be acting only as the law of Christianity, properly understood, would allow them to do. They who set up a claim to a right to judge the conduct of others, should be certain that they understand the nature of religion themselves. It may be presumed, unless there is evidence to the contrary, that others are as conscientious as we are; and it may commonly be supposed that they who differ from us have some reason for what they do, and may be desirous of glorifying their Lord and Master, and that they may possibly be right. It is commonly not safe to judge hastily of a man who has turned his attention to a particular subject, or to suppose that he has no reasons to allege for his opinions or conduct.<p>But if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge - It is implied here that it is the simple duty of every Christian to obey the law. He is not to assume the office of a judge about its propriety or fitness; but he is to do what he supposes the law to require of him, and is to allow others to do the same. Our business in religion is not to make laws, or to declare what they should have been, or to amend those that are made; it is simply to obey those which are appointed, and to allow others to do the same, as they understand them. It would be well for all individual Christians, and Christian denominations, to learn this, and to imbibe the spirit of charity to which it would prompt. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Having mentioned sins of the tongue (Jas 3:5-12), he shows here that evil-speaking flows from the same spirit of exalting self at the expense of one's neighbor as caused the "fightings" reprobated in this chapter (Jas 4:1).<p>Speak not evil&#8212;literally, "Speak not against" one another.<p>brethren&#8212;implying the inconsistency of such depreciatory speaking of one another in brethren.<p>speaketh evil of the law&#8212;for the law in commanding, "Love thy neighbor as thyself" (Jas 2:8), virtually condemns evil-speaking and judging [Estius]. Those who superciliously condemn the acts and words of others which do not please themselves, thus aiming at the reputation of sanctity, put their own moroseness in the place of the law, and claim to themselves a power of censuring above the law of God, condemning what the law permits [Calvin]. Such a one acts as though the law could not perform its own office of judging, but he must fly upon the office [Bengel]. This is the last mention of the law in the New Testament. Alford rightly takes the "law" to be the old moral law applied in its comprehensive spiritual fulness by Christ: "the law of liberty."<p>if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer &#8230; but a judge&#8212;Setting aside the Christian brotherhood as all alike called to be doers of the law, in subjection to it, such a one arrogates the office of a judge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Speak not evil one of another; </span> viz. unless in the way of an ordinance, by reproof, admonition, &c., <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-1.htm" title="And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a witness, whether he has seen or known of it; if he do not utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.">Leviticus 5:1</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-11.htm" title="For it has been declared to me of you, my brothers, by them which are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.">1 Corinthians 1:11</a> 11:18 <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-13.htm" title="For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:13</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-14.htm" title="Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward him according to his works:">2 Timothy 4:14</a>,15</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>He forbids all detraction, rigid censuring, and rash judging the hearts and lives of others, when men condemn whatever doth not suit with their notions or humours, and make their own moroseness the rule of other men’s manners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judgeth his brother; </span> finds fault with and condemns him for those things which the law doth not condemn in him, or forbid to him, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-3.htm" title="Let not him that eats despise him that eats not; and let not him which eats not judge him that eats: for God has received him.">Romans 14:3</a>,4</span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Judgeth the law; </span> viz. either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The apostle here returns to his former subject, concerning the vices of the tongue, he had been upon in the preceding chapter, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm">James 3:6</a>, and here mentions one, which professors of religion were too much guilty of, and that is, speaking evil one of another; which is done either by raising false reports, and bringing false charges; or by aggravating failings and infirmities; or by lessening and depreciating characters, and endeavouring to bring others into discredit and disesteem among men: this is a very great evil, and what the men of the world do, and from them it is expected; but for the saints to speak evil one of another, to sit and speak against a brother, and slander an own mother's son, is barbarous and unnatural. <p>He that speaketh evil of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law; he that is a talebearer and backbites his brother, his fellow member, and detracts from his good name and character, and takes upon him to judge his heart, and his state, as well as, to condemn his actions, he speaks evil of the law; and judges and condemns that, as if that forbid a thing that was lawful, even tale bearing and detraction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>, or by speaking evil of him for a good thing he does, he blames and condemns the law, as though it commanded a thing that was evil; and by passing sentence upon his brother, he takes upon him the province of the law, which is to accuse, charge, convince, pronounce guilty, and condemn: <p>but if thou judge the law, thou art not a doer of the law; as is a duty, and would best become: <p>but a judge; and so such a person not only infringes the right of the law, but assumes the place of the Judge and lawgiver himself; whereas, as follows, <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{7}</span> Speak not evil one of another, brethren.

Without any indication of a connection with the preceding, James passes to a new exhortation, which, however, is so far closely attached to the preceding, inasmuch as humiliation before God carries with itself humility toward our brethren. From the fact that this exhortation, although decidedly earnest, has yet undeniably a milder character than the former, and that James uses here the address <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοί</span>, whereas before it was <span class="greekheb">μοιχαλίδες</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτωλοί</span>, <span class="greekheb">δίψυχοι</span>,[201] it is to be inferred that James now addresses, at least primarily, those who by the worldly ways of others felt induced to do those things against which he here exhorts them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ καταλαλεῖτε ἀλλήλων</span>] <span class="greekheb">καταλαλεῖν</span> only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-12.htm" title="Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.">1 Peter 2:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-16.htm" title="Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ.">1 Peter 3:16</a> (the substantive in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/12-20.htm" title="For I fear, lest, when I come, I shall not find you such as I would, and that I shall be found to you such as you would not: lest there be debates, contentions, wraths, strifes, backbitings, whisperings, arrogance, tumults:">2 Corinthians 12:20</a>; the adjective in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-30.htm" title="Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,">Romans 1:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-1.htm" title="Why laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,">1 Peter 2:1</a>), <span class="ital">to speak in a hostile manner against one;</span> Luther, “to slander:” <span class="greekheb">ἀλλήλων</span>] <span class="ital">against each other.</span> Estius, Semler, Pott, Gebser, Hottinger incorrectly restrict the exhortation to teachers.[202]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ καταλαλῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. assigns the reason of the exhortation. The two ideas <span class="greekheb">καταλαλῶν</span> and <span class="greekheb">κρίνων</span> are indeed closely connected, but are not equivalent, since <span class="greekheb">καταλαλεῖν</span> presupposes <span class="greekheb">κρίνειν</span>; they are here indicated as distinct ideas by <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By the addition <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοῦ</span> not only is the reprehensibleness of <span class="greekheb">καταλαλεῖν</span> emphasized (Schneckenburger: jam hoc vocabulo, quantum peccatur <span class="greekheb">καταλαλιαῖς</span>, submonet), but also the reason is given for the sentiment here expressed <span class="greekheb">καταλαλεῖ νόμου</span>. By <span class="greekheb">αὐτοῦ</span> added to <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφόν</span> this is brought out more strongly, whilst also the brotherly union is more distinctly marked than by the simple <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοῦ</span>; incorrectly Bengel: fraterna aequalitas laeditur obtrectando; sed <span class="ital">magis</span> judicando.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καταλαλεῖ νόμου καὶ κρίνει νόμον</span>] By <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> the same law is here meant as in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">Jam 1:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">Jam 2:9</a>, etc.: the law of Christian life, which according to its contents is none other than the law of love, to which <span class="greekheb">ἀδελφοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ</span> already point. By reviling and condemning one’s <span class="ital">brother</span>, the law of <span class="ital">love</span> itself is reviled and condemned, whilst it is thereby disclaimed as not lawfully existing, and, as may be added, its tendency to save and not to destroy is condemned (Lange). The explanation of de Wette, that there is here a kind of play of words, in which is contained <span class="ital">only</span> the idea of contempt and disregard of the law, is unsatisfactory.[203] Grotius, Baumgarten, Hottinger quite erroneously understand by <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> the Christian doctrine, and find therein expressed the sentiment, that whosoever imposes upon his neighbour arbitrary commandments designates the Christian doctrine as defective, and in so far sets himself up as its judge.[204]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With the following words: <span class="greekheb">εἰ δὲ νόμον κρίνεις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., the further consequence is added: <span class="ital">but if thou judgest the law, thou art not a doer of the law, out a judge.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The particle <span class="greekheb">δέ</span> serves to carry on the thought: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΟὐΚ ΕἾ ΠΟΙΗΤῊς ΝΌΜΟΥ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> thou thereby departest from the attitude which becomes thee; for the law is given to man that he might <span class="ital">do</span> it, but whosoever thinks he has right against the law, cannot be a doer of it, and consequently assumes a position which does not belong to him (Wiesinger), which position is, as the sequel says, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ κριτής</span>. Baumgarten, Gebser, Neander, Wiesinger, Lange, and others supply the genitive <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΌΜΟΥ</span></span></span> to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΙΤΉς</span></span></span>; incorrectly, for (1) this would make this sentence and the one preceding it tautological; (2) it dilutes the idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΙΤΉς</span></span></span> in its contrast to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΙΗΤῊς ΝΌΜΟΥ</span></span></span>; and (3) the sequel which is added to this idea <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΡΊΤΗς</span></span></span>, adverts not to the judging of the law, but to the judging of the man. The meaning is: Whosoever judges the law constitutes himself a judge, giving a law according to which he judges or pronounces sentence upon his neighbour. But this is not the province of man. The following verse tells the reason why it is not so.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[201] Lange incorrectly observes that there is no reason to see here a transition from one class to another. But it is not here maintained that James has in view a sharply exclusive distinction of different classes of his readers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[202] Wiesinger correctly says that we are not here to think of a contest between Jewish and Gentile Christians; Lange incorrectly asserts that the primary reference here is to the internal divisions of Judaism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[203] The opinion of Stier is mistaken: “Whoever improperly and officiously notes and deals with the sins of other men, throws blame thereby upon the law of God, as if it were not sufficient; for he acts as if he supposed it necessary to come to the help of the law.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[204] Lange, in accordance with his view, supposes the reference to be to the Jewish ceremonial law, although he does not explain <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> as equivalent to doctrine. Also Bouman thinks that James has here in view the judicia de aliena conscientia; but James does not indicate that among his readers disputes took place de sabbati veneratione, de licito vel illicito ciborum usu, etc. Augustine here arbitrarily assumes an attack upon the <span class="ital">Gentile Christians.</span> Correctly Laurentius: Is qui detrahit proximo, detrahit legi, quia lex prohibet omnem detractionem, sed et judicat idem legem, quia hoc ipso quod contra prohibitionem legis detrahit, judicat quasi, legem non recte prohibuisse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers.

Rebuke of Evil-speaking<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">11</span>. <span class="ital">Speak not evil one of another, brethren</span>] The last word indicates the commencement of a new section. It scarcely, however, introduces a new topic. The writer dwells with an iteration, needful for others, and not grievous to himself, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-1.htm" title="Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is safe.">Php 3:1</a>) on the ever-besetting sin of his time and people, against which he had warned his readers in Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:...">James 1:19-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">James 1:26</a>, and throughout Ch. 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">speaketh evil of the law, and judgeth the law</span> …] The logical train of thought seems to run thus. To speak against a brother is to condemn him; to condemn, when no duty calls us to it, is to usurp the function of a judge. One who so usurps becomes <span class="ital">ipso facto</span> a transgressor of the law, the royal law, of Christ, which forbids judging (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-1.htm" title="Judge not, that you be not judged....">Matthew 7:1-5</a>). The “brother” who is judged is not necessarily such as a member of the Christian society. The superscription of the Epistle includes under that title every one of the family of Abraham, perhaps, every child of <span class="ital">Adam</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-11.htm" title="Speak not evil one of another, brothers.
