The sovereignty of God is acknowledged, but with it is plainly recognised the existence of man’s free will, dependent, however, on the permission of the Most High for its fleeting duration and power.

Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is to speak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great a restraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; let us not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule to those about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of the Lord. Go to now, is a call to any one to consider his conduct as being wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out of their plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God's blessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projects for futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour being scattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all the prosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for ever must be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We are always to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with cares and contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, and all we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish, and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; it will bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end. Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well as commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect to meditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit gross outward vices against light!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For that ye ought to say - Instead of what you do say, "we will go into such a city," you ought rather to recognise your absolute dependence on God, and feel that life and success are subject to his will. The meaning is not that we ought always to be saying that in so many words, for this might become a mere ostentatious form, offensive by constant unmeaning repetition; but we are, in the proper way, to recognise our dependence on him, and to form all our plans with reference to his will.<p>If the Lord will ... - This is proper, because we are wholly dependent on him for life, and as dependent on him for success. He alone can keep us, and he only can make our plans prosperous. In a thousand ways he can thwart our best-laid schemes, for all things are under his control. We need not travel far in life to see how completely all that we have is in the hands of God, or to learn how easily he can frustrate us if he pleases. There is nothing on which the success of our plans depends over which we have absolute control; there is nothing, therefore, on which we can base the assurance of success but his favor. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>15.

But if we take the words according to our reading: <span class="ital">If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this, or that, </span> the meaning is, that both our life and actions depend upon the will of God, nor the one, nor the other, is in our power. And so here is a double check to the vain boasts of those that were so peremptory in their resolutions, without considering the frailty of their own lives, or the dependence of their actions upon God’s will, when both the one and the other are at his disposal. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/james/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For that ye ought to say,.... Instead of saying we will go to such and such a place, and do this, and that, and the other thing, it should be said, <p>if the Lord will, and we shall live, and do this and that; the last "and" is left out in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; and the passage rendered thus, "if the Lord will, and we shall live, we will do this": so that here are two conditions of doing anything; the one is, if it should be agreeable to the determining will and purpose of God, by which everything in the world comes to pass, and into which the wills of men should be resolved, and resigned; and the other is, if we should live, since life is so very uncertain and precarious: and the sense is, not that this exact form of words should be always used, but what is equivalent to them, or, at least, that there should be always a sense of these things upon the mind; and there should be a view to them in all resolutions, designs, and engagements: and since the words are so short and comprehensive, it might be proper for Christians to use themselves to such a way of speaking; upon all occasions; we find it used by the Apostle Paul frequently, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/18-2.htm">Acts 18:2</a>, and even by Jews, Heathens, and Turks. It is a saying of Ben Syra, the Jew (p), <p>"let a man never say he will do anything, before he says  , "if God will"'' <p>So Cyrus, king of Persia, when, under pretence of hunting, he designed an expedition into Armenia, upon which an hare started, and was caught by an eagle, said to his friends, this will be a good or prosperous hunting to us,  , "if God will" (q). And very remarkable are the words of Socrates to Alcibiades, inquiring of him how he ought to speak; says Socrates,  , "if God will" (r); and says he, in another place (s), <p>"but I will do this, and come unto thee tomorrow, "if God will".'' <p>And it is reported of the Turks (t), that they submit everything to the divine will; as the success of war, or a journey, or anything, even of the least moment, they desire to be done; and never promise themselves, or others, anything, but under this condition, "In Shallah", if God will. <p>(p) Sentent. 11.

De Wette refers <span class="greekheb">καὶ ζήσωμεν</span> to the protasis, and takes the second <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΊ</span></span></span> as belonging to the apodosis: “If the Lord will and we live, we shall,” etc.; so also Erasmus, Luther, Calvin, Hornejus, Pott, and in general most expositors (also Winer, see critical remarks; on the contrary, Al. Buttmann, p. 311 [E. T. 362], prefers the indicative). Schneckenburger, indeed, refers <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑῚ ΖΉΣΩΜΕΝ</span></span></span> to the protasis, but he connects it more closely with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘᾺΝ ΘΕΛΉΣῌ</span></span></span>: si Deo placet ut vivamus tum faciemus (similarly Grotius and Hottinger), which, however, cannot be linguistically justified. Bornemann (in Winer and Engelhardt’s <span class="ital">N. krit. Journ.</span> VI. 1827) commences the apodosis with <span class="greekheb">καὶ ζήσωμεν</span>, and explains it: “Let us seek our sustenance.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Winer correctly observes that this explanation (which Brückner erroneously ascribes to this commentary) lacks simplicity, and is not supported by Biblical usage.[211] Bouman and others (see critical notes) refer <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΖΉΣΩΜΕΝ</span></span></span> naturally to the protasis, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΙΉΣΟΜΕΝ</span></span></span> to the apodosis. The meaning which this reading, unsupported by authorities, gives appears to be suitable, but yet is not correct, for it would be more correct to have said: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘᾺΝ ΖΉΣΩΜΕΝ ΚΑῚ Ὁ ΚΎΡΙΟς ΘΕΛΉΣῌ</span></span></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The indicative is to be preferred to the conjunctive in the apodosis, as a reciprocal call to definite action corresponds less with the context than the resolution to do something.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[210] The indicative future after <span class="greekheb">ἐάν</span> is only found with absolute certainty in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-40.htm" title="And he answered and said to them, I tell you that, if these should hold their peace, the stones would immediately cry out.">Luke 19:40</a>.

This passage occurs in the comment on the eleventh proverb of the “Alphabet,” which runs: “The bride enters the bridal chamber and, nevertheless, knows not what will befall her”. The formula, “If the Name wills,” is, according to Ginsberg, of Mohammedan origin, “for the use of formulas was introduced to the Jews by the Mohammedans”. The formula is, of course, not Ben Sira’s, as it forms no part of the work ascribed to him; the commentary in which it occurs belongs to about the year 1000 probably (see <span class="ital">Jewish Encycl.</span>, ii. 678 f.). <span class="ital">Cf.</span>, further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-21.htm" title="But bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem: but I will return again to you, if God will.

The reference of all the contingencies of the future to one supremely wise and loving Will has been in all ages of Christendom the stay and strength of devout souls.
