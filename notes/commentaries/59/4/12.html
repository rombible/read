As a king is the fountain of honour, so the ultimate source of law is God; and all judgment really is delegated by Him, just as ordinary courts represent the royal majesty: to usurp such functions is to provoke the offended sovereign—whether of earth or heaven. “It is not our part,” said Bengel, “to judge, since we cannot carry out our sentence.” (Comp. a parallel scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm" title="Who are you that judge another man's servant? to his own master he stands or falls. Yes, he shall be held up: for God is able to make him stand.">Romans 14:4</a>.)<p><span class= "bld">Able to save and to destroy.</span>—Life and death, salvation and utter destruction, seem to be placed in intentional contrast here. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm" title="And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.">Matthew 10:28</a>.) The thought of annihilation meets us with awful suggestiveness, yet let us leave the mystery for awhile in happier thought—<p>“That nothing walks with aimless feet;<p>That not one life shall be destroyed,<p>Or cast as rubbish to the void,<p>When God hath made the pile complete.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:11-17 Our lips must be governed by the law of kindness, as well as truth and justice. Christians are brethren. And to break God's commands, is to speak evil of them, and to judge them, as if they laid too great a restraint upon us. We have the law of God, which is a rule to all; let us not presume to set up our own notions and opinions as a rule to those about us, and let us be careful that we be not condemned of the Lord. Go to now, is a call to any one to consider his conduct as being wrong. How apt worldly and contriving men are to leave God out of their plans! How vain it is to look for any thing good without God's blessing and guidance! The frailty, shortness, and uncertainty of life, ought to check the vanity and presumptuous confidence of all projects for futurity. We can fix the hour and minute of the sun's rising and setting to-morrow, but we cannot fix the certain time of a vapour being scattered. So short, unreal, and fading is human life, and all the prosperity or enjoyment that attends it; though bliss or woe for ever must be according to our conduct during this fleeting moment. We are always to depend on the will of God. Our times are not in our own hands, but at the disposal of God. Our heads may be filled with cares and contrivances for ourselves, or our families, or our friends; but Providence often throws our plans into confusion. All we design, and all we do, should be with submissive dependence on God. It is foolish, and it is hurtful, to boast of worldly things and aspiring projects; it will bring great disappointment, and will prove destruction in the end. Omissions are sins which will be brought into judgment, as well as commissions. He that does not the good he knows should be done, as well as he who does the evil he knows should not be done, will be condemned. Oh that we were as careful not to omit prayer, and not to neglect to meditate and examine our consciences, as we are not to commit gross outward vices against light!<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is one lawgiver - There is but one who has a right to give law. The reference here is undoubtedly to the Lord Jesus Christ, the great Legislator of the church. This, too, is a most important and vital principle, though one that has been most imperfectly understood and acted on. The tendency everywhere has been to enact other laws than those appointed by Christ - the laws of synods and councils - and to claim that Christians are bound to observe them, and should be punished if they do not. But it is a fundamental principle in Christianity that no laws are binding on the conscience, but those which Christ has ordained; and that all attempts to make other laws pertaining to religion binding on the conscience is a usurpation of his prerogatives. The church is safe while it adheres to this as a settled principle; it is not safe when it submits to any legislation in religious matters as binding the conscience.<p>Who is able to save and to destroy - Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-28.htm">Matthew 10:28</a>. The idea here would seem to be, that he is able to save those whom you condemn, and to destroy you who pronounce a judgment on them. Or, in general, it may mean that he is intrusted with all power, and is abundantly able to administer his government; to restrain where it is necessary to restrain; to save where it is proper to save; to punish where it is just to punish. The whole matter pertaining to judgment, therefore, may be safely left in his hands; and, as he is abundantly qualified for it, we should not usurp his prerogatives.<p>Who art thou that judgest another? - "Who art thou, a weak and frail and erring mortal, thyself accountable to that Judge, that thou shouldest interfere, and pronounce judgment on another, especially when he is doing only what that Judge permits him to do?" See this sentiment explained at length in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a>. Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-1.htm">Romans 2:1</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm">Matthew 7:1</a> note. There is nothing more decidedly condemned in the Scriptures than the habit of pronouncing a judgment on the motives and conduct of others. There is nothing in which we are more liable to err, or to indulge in wrong feelings; and there is nothing which God claims more for himself as his peculiar prerogative. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

The Alexandrian copy, and others, and the Syriac, Ethiopic, and Vulgate Latin versions, add, "and judge". Who is the one only Lord God, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-22.htm">Isaiah 33:22</a>. This is a character that may be applied to God the Father, who gave the law to the people of Israel, both the judicial and ceremonial law, and also the moral law; from his right hand went a fiery law, and to him belongs the giving of it; and also to the Son of God, the Lord Jesus who is King of saints, and lawgiver in his house; who has given out commandments to be observed, and laws of discipline for the right ordering of his house, and kingdom, to be regarded; and particularly the new commandment of love, which is eminently called the law of Christ; and which is most apparently broke, by detraction and speaking evil one of another: now there may be inferior and subordinate lawgivers, as Judah is said to be God's lawgiver, and Moses is said to command the Jews a law; yet there is but one supreme, universal, and perfect lawgiver, who is God; and though there may be many lawgivers in things political, whose legislative power is to be obeyed, both for the Lord's sake, and for conscience sake; yet in things religious, and relating to conscience, God is the only lawgiver, who is to be hearkened unto: <p>who is able to save, and to destroy; this is true of God the Father, who is able to save, and does save by his Son Jesus Christ, and even persons that have broken the law he has given, and are liable to the curse and condemnation of it; and he is able to save them according to that law, in perfect consistence with it, and with his justice and holiness, since Christ, by whom he saves, was made under it, and has fulfilled it; and that Christ is mighty to save, able to save to the uttermost, is certain from the Scripture, and all experience; and God, the lawgiver, is able to destroy both body and soul in hell, for the transgressions of his law; and even Christ the Lamb is also the lion of the tribe of Judah, who will break his enemies in pieces, as a potter's vessel, and punish the contemners of his Gospel with everlasting destruction, from his presence and glory: in a word, God, the lawgiver, is sovereign, and can destroy, or save, whom he pleases; he is able to save the brother that is spoken against, and to destroy him that speaks against him: <p>who art thou that judgest another? another man's servant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-4.htm">Romans 14:4</a> or "thy neighbour", as the Syriac and Ethiopic versions read; or "the neighbour", as the Alexandrian copy, and the Vulgate Latin version; that is, any brother, friend, or neighbour, in the manner as before observed in the preceding verse. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who art thou that judgest another?</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-12.htm" title="There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who are you that judge another?">Jam 4:12</a>. <span class="ital">One is the lawgiver and judge</span>, (namely) <span class="ital">He who can rescue</span> (save) <span class="ital">and destroy.</span> The chief accent lies on <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span>, in opposition to men who presume to be judges.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ νομοθέτης καὶ κριτής</span>] The idea <span class="greekheb">νομοθέτης</span> is here introduced, because the judging belongs only to Him who has <span class="ital">given</span> the law, and is adduced against those who by judging their neighbour act as lawgivers, whereas their duty is to obey the given law. The explanation of Morus is false: legislator et judex est una eademque persona; and Theile infers from this something entirely foreign: unus est legislator … idem <span class="ital">utriusque</span> legis auctor: et severioris mosaicae et liberalioris christianae … isque etiam judex … et legitimus et idoneus, idque et utriusque legis et eorum qui alterutram sequuntur; of all which there is here no mention.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ δυνάμενος σῶσαι καὶ ἀπολέσαι</span>] serves for a more precise statement of the subject <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> (so also Brückner, Lange, Bouman); it mentions who this One is, and in such a manner that it is also announced why He and He only can be <span class="greekheb">νομοθέτης καὶ κριτής</span>. Schneckenburger correctly observes: <span class="greekheb">ὁ δυνάμενος</span> … articulus appositionis signum, ad subjectum <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span> pertinentis grammatice; but incorrectly adds: ita autem ut, quoad sensum, melius in propriam resolvatur sententiam. Not only grammatically, but also according to the sense, <span class="greekheb">ὁ δυνάμενος</span>, etc., is to be most closely united to <span class="greekheb">εἷς</span>; therefore also Luther’s translation: “there is one Lawgiver who is able to save and to condemn,” is incorrect.[205]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὁ δυνάμενος</span>] is not, with Schneckenburger, to be resolved into <span class="greekheb">ᾧ ἔξεστι</span>, but is to be retained in its literal meaning.

The first words of the verse should be rendered as follows: "One only is the Lawgiver and Judge:" the last words, <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c2;</span>, omitted in the Received Text, being found in <span class="hebrew">&#x5d0;</span>, A, B, and most versions, the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic.
