The text, taken as it stands, would support the views of the Essenes, and many of the Paulicians, and other ancient sectaries. With equal force it might be urged by the followers of Peter Waldo, or the Unitas Fratrum (the Moravians), or the Society of Friends.<p><span class= "bld">Swear not.</span>—The words are put quite distinctly in Greek and English—<span class= "ital">neither by the heaven, nor by the earth.</span> And it sounds like special pleading, worthy of a rabbi, to hear such a divine as Huther say that “swearing by the name of God is not mentioned,” nor accordingly is such an oath prohibited. “We must not imagine,” he continues (and his argument had best be fairly given), “that this is included in the last member of the clause, the Apostle evidently intending by it (<span class= "ital">i.e., ‘</span>neither by any other oath’) to point only at certain formulæ, of which several are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34-37</a>. Had he intended to forbid swearing by the name of God he would most certainly have mentioned it expressly; for not only is it in the Law, in contradistinction to other oaths, commanded (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm" title="But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that swears by him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall be stopped.">Psalm 63:11</a>), but in the prophets is announced as a token of the future turning of men to God” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the middle of my people.">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>). There were, we learn, many subtle distinctions in Jewish oaths; and the unlucky foreigner who trusted in an apparently firm one, too often found out his mistake. Certainly all such subterfuges are utterly condemned; and further, every word which breaks the letter or spirit of God’s Third Commandment. As to the higher judicial forms of oaths, remembering that our Lord answered such before Caiaphas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God.">Matthew 26:63-64</a>), we can fearlessly conclude, with the 39th Article of Religion, that “a man may swear, when the magistrate requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according to the prophet’s teaching—in justice, judgment, and truth.”<p><span class= "bld">Let your yea be yea . . .</span>—Your word be as your bond, needing no strengthening by any invocation of God, or holy things, “lest ye fall into <span class= "ital">judgment</span>”—not “condemnation,” though certainly such might follow.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">James 5:12</a></span>. <span class="ital">But above all things, swear not </span>— However provoked. The Jews were notoriously guilty of common swearing, though not so much by God himself as by some of his creatures. The apostle here forbids these oaths, as well as all swearing in common conversation. It is very observable how solemnly the apostle introduces this command; <span class="ital">above all things, swear not; </span>as if he had said, Whatever you forget, do not forget this. This abundantly demonstrates the horrible iniquity of the crime. But he does not forbid the taking of a solemn oath before a magistrate. <span class="ital">Neither by any other oath </span>— Namely, unlawful or unnecessary; <span class="ital">but let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay </span>— Let your discourse be confirmed with a bare affirmation or denial; and use no higher asseverations in common discourse.

Such swearing expressly throws contempt upon God's name and authority. This sin brings neither gain, nor pleasure, nor reputation, but is showing enmity to God without occasion and without advantage It shows a man to be an enemy to God, however he pretends to call himself by his name, or sometimes joins in acts of worship. But the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. In a day of affliction nothing is more seasonable than prayer. The spirit is then most humble, and the heart is broken and tender. It is necessary to exercise faith and hope under afflictions; and prayer is the appointed means for obtaining and increasing these graces. Observe, that the saving of the sick is not ascribed to the anointing with oil, but to prayer. In a time of sickness it is not cold and formal prayer that is effectual, but the prayer of faith. The great thing we should beg of God for ourselves and others in the time of sickness is, the pardon of sin. Let nothing be done to encourage any to delay, under the mistaken fancy that a confession, a prayer, a minister's absolution and exhortation, or the sacrament, will set all right at last, where the duties of a godly life have been disregarded. To acknowledge our faults to each other, will tend greatly to peace and brotherly love. And when a righteous person, a true believer, justified in Christ, and by his grace walking before God in holy obedience, presents an effectual fervent prayer, wrought in his heart by the power of the Holy Spirit, raising holy affections and believing expectations and so leading earnestly to plead the promises of God at his mercy-seat, it avails much. The power of prayer is proved from the history of Elijah. In prayer we must not look to the merit of man, but to the grace of God. It is not enough to say a prayer, but we must pray in prayer. Thoughts must be fixed, desires must be firm and ardent, and graces exercised. This instance of the power of prayer, encourages every Christian to be earnest in prayer. God never says to any of the seed of Jacob, Seek my face in vain. Where there may not be so much of miracle in God's answering our prayers, yet there may be as much of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But above all things -  That is be especially careful on this point; whatever else is done, let not this be. The manner in which James speaks of the practice referred to here, shows that he regarded it as a sin of a very heinous nature; one that was by all means to be avoided by those whom he addressed. The habit of swearing by various things was a very common one among the Jews, and it was important to guard those who from among them had been converted to Christianity on that subject.<p>Swear not - See this command illustrated in the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33-34</a>.

As impatience should not show itself in secret sighs, groans, murmurings, and repinings, so more especially it should not break forth in rash oaths, or in profane swearing; for of such sort of swearing, and of such oaths, is the apostle to be understood; otherwise an oath is very lawful, when taken in the fear and name of God, and made by the living God, and is used for the confirmation of anything of moment, and in order to put an end to strife; God himself, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and angels, and good men, are in Scripture sometimes represented as swearing: and that the apostle is so to be understood, appears from the form of swearing prohibited, <p>neither by the heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath; of the like kind; such as are forbidden, and cautioned, and reasoned against by our Lord, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a> to which the apostle manifestly refers; See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm">Matthew 5:34</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-35.htm">Matthew 5:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-36.htm">Matthew 5:36</a>. <p>But let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; that is, whenever there is an occasion for affirming, or denying anything, let it be done nakedly, simply, and absolutely, without any form of oath annexed to it; for whatever addition of that kind is made comes from evil, and tends to it, and is evil: <p>lest ye fall into condemnation; by the Lord; for either false, or rash, or profane swearing; for he will not suffer it to go unpunished; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>.

The warning contained in this verse against swearing is in no other connection with the preceding than what lay in the conduct of the readers. The Epistle of James was occasioned by manifold faults in the churches, and therefore he could not conclude without referring to the inconsiderate swearing prevalent among them. It is as little indicated that he refers to the warning against abuse of the tongue (chap. 3; Hornejus) as that this swearing arose from impatience, against which the preceding verses are directed (against Gataker, Wiesinger). How important this warning was to the author the words <span class="greekheb">πρὸ πάντων δέ</span> show, by which it is indicated that it of all other exhortations is to be specially taken to heart. James assigns the reason of this in the words <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The warning <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμνύετε</span> is more exactly stated in the words <span class="greekheb">μήτε τὸν οὐρανόν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτε τὴν γῆν</span>, <span class="greekheb">μήτε ἄλλον τινὰ ὅρκον</span>. It is to be noticed that swearing <span class="ital">by the name of God</span> is not mentioned. This is not, as Rauch along with others maintains, to be considered as included in the last member of the clause, but James with <span class="greekheb">μήτε ἄλλον τινὰ ὅρκον</span> has in view only similar formulae as the above, of which several are mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-35.htm" title="Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King....">Matthew 5:35-36</a>. Had James intended to forbid swearing by the name of God, he would most certainly have expressly mentioned it; for not only is it commanded in the O. T. law, in contradistinction to other oaths (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-13.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God, and serve him, and shall swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 6:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/10-20.htm" title="You shall fear the LORD your God; him shall you serve, and to him shall you hold, and swear by his name.">Deuteronomy 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/63-1.htm" title="O God, you are my God; early will I seek you: my soul thirsts for you, my flesh longs for you in a dry and thirsty land, where no water is;...">Psalm 63:1-2</a>), but also in the prophets it is announced as a token of the future turning of men to God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-16.htm" title="That he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth; and he that swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.">Isaiah 65:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/12-16.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the middle of my people.">Jeremiah 12:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/23-7.htm" title="Therefore, behold, the days come, said the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD lives, which brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;...">Jeremiah 23:7-8</a>). The omission of <span class="ital">this oath</span> shows that James in this warning has in view only the abuse, common among the Jews generally and also among his readers, of introducing in the common every-day affairs of life, instead of the simple yea or nay, such asseverations as those here mentioned; so that we are not justified in deducing from his words an absolute prohibition of swearing in general,[236] as has been done by many expositors of our Epistle, and especially by Oecumenius, Bede, Erasmus, Gebser, Hottinger, Theile, de Wette, Neander (comp. also Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a> ff.); whereas Calvin, Estius, Hornejus, Laurentius, Grotius, Pott, Baumgarten, Michaelis, Storr, Morus, Schneckenburger, Kern, Wiesinger, Bouman, Lange,[237] and others, refer James’ prohibition to light and trifling oaths. The use of oaths by heaven etc., arises, on the one hand, from forgetting that <span class="ital">every</span> oath, in its deeper significance, is a swearing by God; and, on the other hand, from a depreciation of the <span class="ital">simple</span> word, thus from a frivolity which is in direct contrast to the earnestness of the Christian disposition. The construction of <span class="greekheb">ὀμνύειν</span> with the accusative <span class="greekheb">τὸν οὐρανόν</span>, etc., is in accordance with classical usage, whereas the construction with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> and <span class="greekheb">εἴς</span> (in Matt.) is according to Hebraistic usage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To the prohibition James opposes the command with the words <span class="greekheb">ἤτω δὲ ὑμῶν τὸ ναὶ ναὶ καὶ τὸ οὒ οὔ</span>, which do not express a new exhortation (Schneckenburger), but the contrast to <span class="greekheb">ὀμνύειν τὸν οὐρανόν</span>, etc. Most expositors (Theophylact, Oecumenius, Zwingli, Calvin, Hornejus, Grotius, Bengel, Gebser, Schneckenburger, Kern, Stier, and others) find here a command to <span class="ital">truthfulness</span> expressed; but incorrectly, as in the foregoing <span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμνύετε</span> a reference to the contrast between truth and falsehood is not in question at all. De Wette correctly explains it: “let your yea be (a simple) yea, and your nay (a simple) nay” (so also Estius, Piscator, Hottinger, Neander, Wiesinger, and others; comp. Al. Buttmann, p. 142 [E. T. 163]).[238] Not the sentiment itself, but its form only is different from <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-37.htm" title="But let your communication be, Yes, yes; No, no: for whatever is more than these comes of evil.">Matthew 5:37</a> (see Tholuck and Meyer <span class="ital">in loco</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The form <span class="greekheb">ἤτω</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-31.htm" title="The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.">Psalm 104:31</a>, LXX.) instead of <span class="greekheb">ἔστω</span> is found in classical Greek only once in Plato, <span class="ital">Rep.</span> ii. p. 361 (see Buttmann, <span class="ital">Ausführl.

T. 95]).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ ὑπὸ κρίσιν πέσητε</span>] assigns the reason why one should not swear, but should be satisfied with the simple yea or nay. According to its meaning, the expression is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἵνα μὴ κριθῆτε</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-9.htm" title="Grudge not one against another, brothers, lest you be condemned: behold, the judge stands before the door.">Jam 5:9</a>.

By <span class="greekheb">κρίσις</span> is to be understood judicium condemnatorium. The swearing forbidden by James subjects to the judgment, because it is founded on and in every instance promotes frivolity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[236] Rauch says: “One should give honour to the truth, and freely and without prejudice recognise that according to the clear words of the text here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-34.htm" title="But I say to you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God's throne:">Matthew 5:34</a> ff., a general and unconditional prohibition of all oaths is expressed.” To this it is replied that honour is given to the truth when one is not taken by <span class="ital">appearance</span>, but seeks without prejudice to comprehend the <span class="ital">actual meaning.</span> In opposition to the view that Christ by the prohibition of oaths, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:">Matthew 5:33</a> ff., has in view the <span class="ital">ideal</span> condition of the church, Wiesinger with justice observes: “It can no longer be said, in reference to our passage, that only an ideal requirement is expressed calculated for entirely different circumstances than those which were in reality, for there can be no doubt that James demands for his requirement complete practice under the actual and not the ideal circumstances of his readers.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[237] Lange by this understands more exactly: “conspiracy, which is a swearing accompanied by hypothetical imprecations or the giving of a pledge.” Moreover, his view of the design of the Epistle misled him to find the reason of this prohibition in Jewish zeal to enter into conspiracies.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[238] Lange would unite the two points together; and he is so far not in the wrong, as James presupposes truthfulness.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">f1Πρὸ πάντων</span> …: The most natural way of understanding these words would be to take them in connection with something that immediately preceded, but as there is not the remotest connection between this verse and the section that has gone just before, this is impossible here; the verse must be regarded as the fragment of some larger piece; it is not the only instance in this Epistle of a quotation which has been incorporated, only in this case the fragmentary character is more than usually evident. That it is not a quotation from the Gospel, as we now have it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-33.htm" title="Again, you have heard that it has been said by them of old time, You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform to the Lord your oaths:...">Matthew 5:33-37</a>), must be obvious, for if it were this, it would unquestionably approximate more closely to the original; on the other hand, its general similarity to the Gospel passage proves that there must be a relationship of some kind between the two. Probably both trace their origin to a saying of our Lord’s which became modified in transmission, assuming various forms while retaining the essential point. An example of a similar kind can be seen by comparing together <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-26.htm" title="Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.">Matthew 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-17.htm" title="For nothing is secret, that shall not be made manifest; neither any thing hid, that shall not be known and come abroad.">Luke 8:17</a> and the fourth of the New Oxyrhynchus Sayings: <span class="greekheb">Λέγει Ἰησοῦς Πᾶν τὸ μὴ ἔμπροσθεν τῆς ὄψεώς σου καὶ τὸ κεκρυμμένον ἀπὸ σοῦ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται</span>. <span class="greekheb">οὐ γάρ ἐστιν κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ φανερὸν γενήσεται καὶ τεθαμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἐγερθήσεται</span> (Grenfell and Hunt’s restoration). In any case the verse before us must originally have been preceded by a context which contained various precepts of which this was regarded as the most important, on account of the words <span class="greekheb">πρὸ πάντων</span>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ ὀμνύετε</span> …: this was a precept enjoined by many of the more devout Jews; Pharisees avoided oaths as much as possible, the Essenes never swore; a very good pre-Christian example of the same precept is contained in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-9.htm" title="Accustom not thy mouth to swearing; neither use thyself to the naming of the Holy One....">Sir 23:9-11</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ὅρκῳ μὴ ἐθίσῃς τὸ στόμα σου</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὀνομασίᾳ τοῦ ἁγίου μὴ συνεθισθῇς</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀνὴρ πολύορκος πλησθήσεται ἀνομίας</span> …—<span class="greekheb">ἤτω</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/16-22.htm" title="If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be Anathema Maranatha.">1 Corinthians 16:22</a>, the only other occurrence of this form in the N.T.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>12.

Comp. <span class="ital">Introduction</span>, p. 8. The words condemn alike the rash use of oaths in common speech, and the subtle distinctions drawn by the Scribes as to the binding force of this or that formula (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/23-16.htm" title="Woe to you, you blind guides, which say, Whoever shall swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!...">Matthew 23:16-22</a>). That the condemnation does not extend to the solemn judicial use of oaths we see in the facts (1) that our Lord answered when questioned as on oath by Caiaphas (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/26-63.htm" title="But Jesus held his peace, And the high priest answered and said to him, I adjure you by the living God, that you tell us whether you be the Christ, the Son of God....">Matthew 26:63-64</a>), and (2) that St Paul at times used modes of expression which are essentially of the nature of an oath (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-23.htm" title="Moreover I call God for a record on my soul, that to spare you I came not as yet to Corinth.">2 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-9.htm" title="For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers;">Romans 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-20.htm" title="Now the things which I write to you, behold, before God, I lie not.">Galatians 1:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-8.htm" title="For God is my record, how greatly I long after you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ.">Php 1:8</a>). It is not without interest to note that in this respect also the practice of the Essenes, in their efforts after holiness, was after the pattern of the teaching of St James. They, too, avoided oaths as being no less an evil than perjury itself (Joseph. <span class="ital">Wars.</span> ii. viii. 85). They, however, with a somewhat strange inconsistency, bound the members of their own society by “tremendous oaths” of obedience and secresy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-12.htm" title="But above all things, my brothers, swear not, neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but let your yes be yes; and your no, no; lest you fall into condemnation.">Jam 5:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μὴ ὀμνύετε</span>, <span class="ital">do not swear</span>) for instance, through impatience.

He, like his Master, "lays down rules and maxims and principles without specifying the limitations and exceptions." The sermon on the mount, as interpreted by our Lord's own actions, is a clear witness that this formed <span class="accented">Ms</span> method of teaching. If, then, his words do not touch the case of oaths solemnly tendered to men in a court of justice (and his own acceptance of an adjuration on his trial shows that they do <span class="accented">not</span>), no more do St. James's. Both our Lord and his apostle had probably in view "only those profane adjurations with which men who have no deep-seated fear of God garnish their common talk" (see Sadler's 'Commentary on St. Matthew,' p. 66). The special oaths mentioned were those in vogue among the Jews, and just the very ones which our Lord himself had specified (comp. Lightfoot's 'Horae Hebraicae,' vol. 2. p. 127, edit. Gandell). On the need of such teaching as this, see Thomson's 'Land and the Book,' p. 190: "This people are fearfully profane. Everybody curses and swears when in a passion. No people that I have ever known can compare with these Orientals for profaneness in the use of the names and attributes of God. The evil habit seems inveterate and universal. When Peter, therefore, 'began to curse and to swear' on that dismal night of temptation, we are not to suppose that it was something foreign to his former habits. He merely relapsed, under high excitement, into what, as a sailor and a fisherman, he had been accustomed to all his life. The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long." So, too, Aben Ezra speaks of the practice of swearing as almost universal in his day, so that he says, "men swear daily countless times, and then swear that they have not sworn!" With regard to the translation of the verse, two renderings are possible: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> that of the A.V. and of the R.V. (text), "Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay." <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> That of the R.V. margin, "Let yours be the yea, yea, and the nay, nay;" viz. those enjoined by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-37.htm">Matthew 5:37</a>), "Let your communication be Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil." On behalf of this latter rendering, may be pleaded <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(a)</span> the clearness of the reference to our Lord's teaching; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(b)</span> the fact that this is the interpretation given to the clause in the two leading versions of antiquity, the Syriac and the Vulgate, both of which have exactly the same words here and in St. Matthew.
