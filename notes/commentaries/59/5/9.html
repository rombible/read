In the one Christ lingers mercifully outside the door that “loves its hinge”; fain would He enter and abide. In the other He sounds a note of alarm; men are “waked in the night, not girding their loins for a journey, but in vague wonder at uncertain noise, who may turn again to their slumber,” or in wistful listening wait in vain for the voice of mercy which shall plead with them no more for ever (Ruskin).<p>One of the mocking questions put to St. James by his enemies, as they hurried him to death, was, “Which is the <span class= "ital">door</span> of Jesus?” And failing to receive an answer to their mind, they said, “Let us stone this James the Just!” which they did, after they had cast him over the Temple wall.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:7-11 Consider him that waits for a crop of corn; and will not you wait for a crown of glory? If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Grudge not one against another - Margin, "groan, grieve." The Greek word (&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3b6;&#x3c9;  stenazo&#772;) means, "to sigh, to groan," as of persons in distress, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-23.htm">Romans 8:23</a>; and then to sigh or groan through impatience, fretfulness, ill-humor; and hence "to murmur, to find fault, to complain." The exact idea here is, not that of grudging in the sense of dissatisfaction with what others possess, or of being envious; it is that of being fretful and impatient - or, to use a common word which more exactly expresses the sense that of grumbling. This may arise from many causes; either because others have advantages which we have not, and we are discontented and unhappy, as if it were wrong in them to have such enjoyments; or because we, without reason, suppose they intend to slight and neglect us; or because we are ready to take offence at any little thing, and to "pick a quarrel" with them. There are some persons who are always grumbling. They have a sour, dissatisfied, discontented temper; they see no excellence in other persons; they are displeased that others are more prospered, honored, and beloved than they are themselves; they are always complaining of what others do, not because they are injured, but because others seem to them to be weak and foolish; they seem to feel that it becomes them to complain if everything is not done precisely as in their estimation it should be. It is needless to say that this spirit - the offspring of pride - will make any man lead a wretched life; and equally needless to say that it is wholly contrary to the spirit of the gospel. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-14.htm">Luke 3:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-11.htm">Philippians 4:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-8.htm">1 Timothy 6:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/13-5.htm">Hebrews 13:5</a>.<p>Lest ye be condemned - That is, for judging others with this spirit - for this spirit is in fact judging them.

Grudge not&#8212;rather "Murmur not"; "grumble not." The Greek is literally, "groan": a half-suppressed murmur of impatience and harsh judgment, not uttered aloud or freely. Having exhorted them to patience in bearing wrongs from the wicked, he now exhorts them to a forbearing spirit as to the offenses given by brethren. Christians, who bear the former patiently, sometimes are impatient at the latter, though much less grievous.<p>lest &#8230; condemned&#8212;The best manuscript authorities read, "judged." James refers to Mt 7:1, "Judge not lest ye be judged." To "murmur against one another" is virtually to judge, and so to become liable to be judged.<p>judge &#8230; before the door&#8212;referring to Mt 24:33. The Greek is the same in both passages, and so ought to be translated here as there, "doors," plural. The phrase means "near at hand" (Ge 4:7), which in the oldest interpretations [Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem] is explained, "thy sin is reserved unto the judgment of the world to come." Compare "the everlasting doors" (Ps 24:7, whence He shall come forth). The Lord's coming to destroy Jerusalem is primarily referred to; and ultimately, His coming again visibly to judgment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Grudge not; </span> Greek: Groan not; the sense may be, either: Envy not one another, (or, as we translate it: <span class="ital">Grudge not</span>), it being the nature of envy to groan at other men’s good; or, Groan not by way of accusation or complaint to God against others, desiring him to avenge your quarrels, as if you were too good to suffer injuries, or God were unjnst or forgetful of righting you. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">One against another; </span> brother against brother, Christian against Christian: they were injured not only by rich worldlings and open oppressors, but by their fellow professors, and gave one another mutual cause of sighing and groaning. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Lest ye be condemned; </span> lest God punish you all; there being none of you but have given others cause of grief and complaint, as well as others have given you, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm" title="Judge not, that you be not judged.">Matthew 7:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Behold, the Judge standeth before the door; </span> the Lord Jesus Christ, the Judge of you all, is at hand, <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm" title="Let your moderation be known to all men.
