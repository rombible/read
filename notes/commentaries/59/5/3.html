The precious metals themselves do not corrode, but the base alloy does, which has been mixed with them for worldly use and device. <span class= "ital">The rust of them shall be a witness to you</span>: not merely against, but convincing yourselves in the day of judgment; and, moreover, a sign of the fire which shall consume you. So will the wages of the traitor, and the harlot, the spoil of the thief and oppressor, burn the hands which have clutched them; the memories of the wrong shiver through each guilty soul, like the liquid fires which Muhammedans say torture the veins of the damned in the halls of Eblis.<p><span class= "bld">Ye have heaped . . .</span>—Read, <span class= "ital">Ye heaped up treasures in the last days:</span>—the days of grace, given you for repentance, like the years when “the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-3.htm" title="And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.">Genesis 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm" title="Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water.">1Peter 3:20</a>), or the time during which God bore with Canaan, “till the iniquity of the Amorite” was “full” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-16.htm" title="But in the fourth generation they shall come here again: for the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.">Genesis 15:16</a>).<p>Some expositors have seen in this verse an instance of James’s belief that he was “living in the last days of the world’s history;” and compared his delusion with that of Paul and John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1John 2:18</a>). But there was no mistake on the part of the inspired. writers; freedom from error in their Sacred office must be vindicated, or who shall sever the false gospel from the true? The simple explanation is an old one—the <span class= "ital">potential</span> nearness of Christ, as it is called. In many ways He has been ever near each individual, as by affliction, or death, or judgment; but His actual return was probably nearer in the first ages of faith than in the brutality of the tenth century, or the splendid atheism of the fifteenth, or the intellectual pride of the nineteenth. His advent is helped or hindered by the state of Christendom itself: “one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-8.htm" title="But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.">2Peter 3:8</a>), there is: neither past nor future in His sight; only the presence of His own determination: and nought retards Christ’s Second Coming so much as the false and feeble Christianity which prays “Thy kingdom come” in frequent words, but waits not as the handmaid of her Lord, with “loins girded about and lights burning” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-35.htm" title="Let your loins be girded about, and your lights burning;">Luke 12:35</a>), “until the day dawn, and the day star arise” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-19.htm" title="We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto you do well that you take heed, as to a light that shines in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your hearts:">2Peter 1:19</a>).<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, and are secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times. All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Your gold and silver is cankered - That is, that you have heaped together, by injustice and fraud, a large amount, and have kept it from those to whom it is due, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/5-4.htm">James 5:4</a>, until it has become corroded. The word rendered is "cankered" (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  katio&#772;tai,) does not occur elsewhere in the New Testament. It properly means "to cause to rust; to rust out" (Passow); "to be corroded with rust" (Robinson); to be spotted with rust. It is true that gold and silver do not properly rust, or become oxidized, and that they will not be corroded like iron and steel; but by being kept long in a damp place they will contract a dark color, resembling rust in appearance. This seems to be the idea in the mind of the apostle. He speaks of gold and silver as they appear after having been long laid up without use; and undoubtedly the word which he uses here is one which would to an ancient have expressed that idea, as well as the mere literal idea of the rusting or oxidizing of metals. There is no reason to suppose that the word was then used in the strict chemical sense of rusting, for there is no reason to suppose that the nature of oxidization was then fully understood.<p>And the rust of them - Another word is used here - &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  ios. This properly denotes something sent out or emitted, (from &#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;  he&#772;mi), and is applied to a missile weapon, as an arrow; to poison, as emitted from the tooth of a serpent; and to rust, as it seems to be emitted from metals. The word refers to the dark discoloration which appears on gold and silver, when they have remained long without use.<p>Shall be a witness against you - That is, the rust or discoloration shall bear testimony against you that the money is not used as it should be, either in paying those to whom it is due, or in doing good to others. Among the ancients, the gold and silver which anyone possessed was laid up in some secret and safe place. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-3.htm">Isaiah 45:3</a>. There were no banks then in which money might be deposited; there were few ways of investing money so as to produce regular interest; there were no corporations to employ money in joint operations; and it was not very common to invest money in the purchase of real estate, and stocks and mortgages were little known.<p>And shall eat your flesh as it were fire - This cannot be taken literally. It must mean that the effect would be as if it should corrode or consume their very flesh; that is, the fact of their laying up treasures would be followed by painful consequences. The thought is very striking, and the language in which it is conveyed is singularly bold and energetic. The effect of thus heaping up treasure will be as corroding as fire in the flesh. The reference is to the punishment which God would bring on them for their avarice and in-justice - effects that will come on all now for the same offences.<p>Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days - The day of judgment; the closing scenes of this world. You have been heaping up treasure; but it will be treasure of a different kind from what you have supposed. It is treasure not laid up for ostentation, or luxury, or use in future life, but treasure the true worth of which will be seen at the judgment-day. So Paul speaks of "treasuring up wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God," <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>. There are many who suppose they are accumulating property that may be of use to them, or that may secure them the reputation of possessing great wealth, who are in fact accumulating a most fearful treasure against the day of final retribution. Every man who is rich should examine himself closely to see whether there is anything in the manner in which he has gained his property, or in which he now holds it, that will expose him to the wrath of God in the last day. That on which he so much prides himself may yet bring down on him the vengeance of heaven; and in the day of judgment he may curse his own madness and folly in wasting his probation in efforts to amass property. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. is cankered&#8212;"rusted through" [Alford].<p>rust &#8230; witness against you&#8212;in the day of judgment; namely, that your riches were of no profit to any, lying unemployed and so contracting rust.<p>shall eat your flesh&#8212;The rust which once ate your riches, shall then gnaw your conscience, accompanied with punishment which shall prey upon your bodies for ever.<p>as &#8230; fire&#8212;not with the slow process of rusting, but with the swiftness of consuming fire.<p>for the last days&#8212;Ye have heaped together, not treasures as ye suppose (compare Lu 12:19), but wrath against the last days, namely, the coming judgment of the Lord. Alford translates more literally, "In these last days (before the coming judgment) ye laid up (worldly) treasure" to no profit, instead of repenting and seeking salvation (see on [2608]Jas 5:5).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Your gold and silver is cankered; </span> the most precious and lasting metals; yet even they, with long disuse, canker, and go to decay.

It is as much as if he had said: The rust shall be a certain evidence against you, and which will as effectually convict you, as any living witness could do, of your folly in putting your trust in perishing things, your greediness in hoarding them up, your unmercifulness in not supplying the wants of others, and your unreasonableness in denying the use of them to yourselves, when you had rather let them lie by and perish, than enjoy the comfort of them, or do good with them.

Or grown rusty like iron, by lying long without use; this is not easily and quickly done, but in length of time gold and silver will change, and contract a rustiness; and so this conveys the same idea of hoarding up riches and laying up money, without making use of it in trade, for the support of the poor, and without distributing it to their necessities: <p>and the rust of them shall be a witness against you: at the day of judgment; which will be a proof that they have not been employed to such services, and for such usefulness, for which they were designed and given. <p>And shall eat your flesh as it were fire; that is, a remembrance of this, a sense of it impressed upon them, shall be like fire in their bones; shall distress their minds, gnaw their consciences, and be in them the worm that never dies, and the fire that shall never be quenched: <p>ye have heaped treasure together for the last days; either for many years, as the fool in the Gospel, for the times of old age, the last days of men, for fear they should then want; or for the last days of the world, or of time, as if they thought they should live for ever: the Vulgate Latin version reads, "ye have treasured up wrath for yourselves in the last days"; instead of riches, as they imagined; and that by their covetousness and wickedness, by a wicked disuse of their riches, and an unrighteous detention of them; but this supplement seems to be taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a> though the sense is confirmed by some copies which connect the phrase, "as it were fire", in the preceding clause, with this, "ye have treasured up as it were fire"; and the Syriac version renders it, "ye have treasured up fire"; the fire of divine wrath; this is the fruit of treasuring up riches in an ill way, and without making a proper use of them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.

Continuation of the description of the judgment: <span class="greekheb">ὁ χρυσὸς ὑμῶν καὶ ὁ ἄργυρος</span>] a further specification of riches. <span class="greekheb">κατίωται</span>] in the N. T. <span class="greekheb">ἅπ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λεγ</span>. (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-10.htm" title="Never trust thine enemy: for like as iron rusteth, so is his wickedness.">Sir 12:10</a>), equivalent to the simple verb, only in a stronger signification. Correctly Hornejus: loquitur populariter, nam aurum proprie aeruginem lion contrahit; so in the Epistle of Jeremiah 11, where it is said of gold and silver images: <span class="greekheb">οὐ διασώζονται ἀπὸ ἰοῦ</span>; see also in the same, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-23.htm" title="But this people has a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are revolted and gone.">Jeremiah 5:23</a>. With too minute accuracy, Bretschneider justifies the use of the verb here, that we are to think on gold and silver vessels which are alloyed with <span class="ital">copper</span> (similarly Bouman). It is no less incorrect, with Pott, to weaken the idea <span class="greekheb">κατίωται</span>, that it is to be understood only of amisso auri et argenti splendore, de mutato auri colore ex flavo in viridem; against this is <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἰός</span> directly following. Wiesinger thinks that because <span class="greekheb">κατίωται</span> is here used figuratively, it is a matter of indifference that rust does not affect gold; but the ideas must suit each other in the figurative expression. The verb is rather here to be justified by the fact that since rust settles on metals generally, James in his vivid concrete description did not scrupulously take into consideration the difference of metals, which, however, is not to be reckoned, with de Wette, as a “poetical exaggeration.”[220]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ ὁ ἰὸς αὐτῶν</span> (namely, <span class="greekheb">τοῦ χρυσοῦ καὶ τοῦ ἀργύρου</span>), <span class="greekheb">εἰς μαρτύριον ὑμῖν ἔσται</span>] Most expositors agree with the explanation of Oecumenius: <span class="greekheb">καταμαρτυρήσει ὑμῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἐλέγχων τὸ ἀμετάδοτον ὑμῶν</span>; accordingly, “The rust which has collected on your unused gold and silver will testify to your hardness, and that to your injury = <span class="greekheb">κατʼ ὑμῶν</span>.” But since the preceding <span class="greekheb">κατίωται</span> describes the judgment overtaking earthly glory, <span class="greekheb">ἰός</span> can only be understood with reference to it; correctly Wiesinger: “the rust is a witness of their own destruction; in the destruction of their treasures they see depicted their own.”[221] Augusti superficially explains it: “will convince you that all riches are transitory.” After their riches are destroyed, the judgment seizes upon themselves; therefore <span class="greekheb">καὶ φάγεται τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν</span>. The subject is <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἰός</span>, “the corroding rust seizes also them, and will eat their flesh” (Wiesinger). The figurative expression, although bold and peculiar, is not unsuitable, since <span class="greekheb">ἰός</span> is considered as an effect of judgment. <span class="greekheb">φάγεται</span>] is not the present (Schneckenburger), but in the LXX. and N. T. the ordinary future for <span class="greekheb">ἔδεται</span>; see Buttmann, <span class="ital">Ausf. gr. Sprach.</span> § 114 [E. T. 58], under <span class="greekheb">ἐσθίω</span>; Winer, p. 82 [E. T. 110]. The object <span class="greekheb">τὰς σάρκας ὑμῶν</span> belonging to <span class="greekheb">φάγεται</span> is neither = <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span> (Baumgarten), nor yet in itself indicates “bloated bodies” (Augusti, Pott: corpora lautis cibis bene pasta); also Schneckenburger lays too much stress on the expression, explaining it: emphatice, quum ejusmodi homines nihil sint nisi <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. According to usage, <span class="greekheb">αἱ σάρκες</span> denotes the fleshy parts of the body, therefore the plural is also used with reference to <span class="ital">one</span> individual; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-36.htm" title="Why they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:">2 Kings 9:36</a> : <span class="greekheb">καταφάγονται οἱ κύνες τὰς σάρκας Ἰεζάβελ</span>; further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm" title="And you shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters shall you eat.">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/16-17.htm" title="Woe to the nations that rise up against my kindred! the Lord Almighty will take vengeance of them in the day of judgment, in putting fire and worms in their flesh; and they shall feel them, and weep for ever.">Jdt 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-18.htm" title="That you may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and bond, both small and great.">Revelation 19:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-21.htm" title="And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat on the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh.">Revelation 19:21</a>; in definite distinction from bones, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/3-2.htm" title="Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;...">Micah 3:2-3</a>. It is to be remarked that in almost all these passages the same verb is united with the noun.[222] The context shows that what is spoken of is not “the consuming of the body by care and want” (Erasmus, Semler, Jaspar, Morus, Hottinger, Bouman), but the punishment of the divine judgment (Calvin, Grotius, Pott, Schneckenburger, de Wette, Wiesinger, and others). The words <span class="greekheb">ὡς πῦρ</span> may be united either with what goes before or with what follows. Most expositors prefer the first combination; yet already A, the Syriac version (where <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> is wanting), and Oecumenius in his commentary put a stop after <span class="greekheb">ὑμῶν</span>. Grotius, Knapp, and Wiesinger, considering this construction as correct, accordingly explain it: tanquam ignem opes istas congessetis; Wiesinger states as a reason for this, that without the union with <span class="greekheb">ὡς πῦρ</span> the words <span class="greekheb">ἐθησαυρίσατε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. give too feeble a meaning. But this is not the case, since the chief stress rests on <span class="greekheb">ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις</span> (so also Lange); also James could not well reckon riches as a fire of judgment. Besides, in the O. T. the judgment is frequently represented as a devouring consuming fire, which was sufficient to suggest to James to add <span class="greekheb">ὡς πῦρ</span> to <span class="greekheb">φάγεται</span>; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/21-10.htm" title="Their fruit shall you destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.">Psalm 21:10</a>, LXX.: <span class="greekheb">καταφάγεται αὐτοὺς πῦρ</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-16.htm" title="Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a burning like the burning of a fire....">Isaiah 10:16-17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-27.htm" title="Behold, the name of the LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:">Isaiah 30:27</a> (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ὀργὴ τοῦ θυμοῦ ὡς πῦρ ἔδεται</span>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-7.htm" title="And I will set my face against them; they shall go out from one fire, and another fire shall devour them; and you shall know that I am the LORD, when I set my face against them.">Ezekiel 15:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-6.htm" title="Seek the LORD, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.">Amos 5:6</a>.[223] The sentiment is: After the judgment has overtaken the wealth of the rich, it will attack themselves. Kern gives the sentiment in an unsatisfactory manner: “The destruction of that which was everything to the rich will punish him with torturing sorrow, as if fire devoured his flesh.” That the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΑΛΑΙΠΩΡΊΑΙ</span></span></span> already draw near is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>, and James by the words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΘΗΣΑΥΡΊΣΑΤΕ ἘΝ ἘΣΧΆΤΑΙς ἩΜΈΡΑΙς</span></span></span> indicates that the judgment is close at hand, so that <span class="ital">this time</span> is the <span class="ital">last days</span> directly preceding the judgment; accordingly, the heaping up of treasure appears as something so much the more wicked. Estius, Calvin, Laurentius, and others incorrectly supply to the verb the word <span class="greekheb">ὀργήν</span> in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/1-18.htm" title="And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privately for their own lives.">Proverbs 1:18</a>).

The preposition <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ</span></span></span> is not used instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς</span></span></span>, and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἜΣΧΑΤΑΙ ἩΜΈΡΑΙ</span></span></span> are not the last days of life (Wolf: accumulavistis divitias extremae vitae parti provisuri; Morus: cumulastis opes sub finem vitae vestrae), but the last times which precede the advent of Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord.

According to Lange, <span class="greekheb">αἱ σάρκες</span> are “the externals of religious, civil, and individual life;” and the thought of James is that “the rotten fixity described as rust in its last stage transforms itself in the fire of a revolutionary movement!”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[223] Pott: Aerugo describitur, quasi invadat membra divitum, eaque quasi, ut metallum, arrodat atque consumat et quidem … <span class="greekheb">ὡς πῦρ</span>, tanquam flamma membra quasi circumlabens carnemque lento dolore depascens.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm" title="Your gold and silver is corroded; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.

The underlying image suggested is that the rust or canker spreads from the riches to the very life itself, and that when they fail, and leave behind them only the sense of wasted opportunities and the memories of evil pleasures, the soul will shudder at their work as the flesh shudders at the touch of fire. We may perhaps trace a reminiscence of the “unquenchable fire” devouring the carcases in Gehenna, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/9-44.htm" title="Where their worm dies not, and the fire is not quenched.">Mark 9:44</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days</span>] Better, <span class="bld">Ye laid</span> (<span class="ital">or, ye have laid</span>) <span class="bld">up treasure in the last days</span>. The preposition cannot possibly have the sense of “for.” St James shared the belief of other New Testament writers that they were living in “the last days” of the world’s history, and that the “coming of the Lord” was nigh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm" title="Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,">1 Corinthians 15:51</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>). For those to whom he wrote the words had a very real truth. They were actually living in the “last days” of the polity of Israel. In the chaos and desolation of its fall their heaped-up treasures would avail but little. They would be marked out in proportion to their wealth, as the first to be attacked and plundered.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-3.htm" title="Your gold and silver is corroded; and the rust of them shall be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were fire.

The rendering of the A.V. is quite defensible (see Winer, p. 265), but it is equally possible to take the words as the R.V. margin," for a testimony <span class="accented">unto</span> you." "The rust of them," says Alford, "is a token of what shall happen to yourselves; in the consuming of your wealth you see depicted your own."

Ye have heaped up as it were fire in the last days." This has the support of the Syriac ("Ye have gathered fire for you for the last days"), and is adopted by Drs. Westcott and Herr. The "fire" will, of course, be the fire of judgment; and the expression, <span class="greek">&#x1f61;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>, may easily have been suggested by <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/16-27.htm">Proverbs 16:27</a>, <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3c1;&#x20;&#x1f04;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x1f71;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f76;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f11;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x20;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span>. The whole form of expression also reminds us of St. Paul's "treasurest up for thyself wrath in the day of wrath" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm">Romans 2:5</a>), to which it is exactly parallel, the "wrath in the day of wrath" there answering to the "fire in the last days" here. (The rendering of the Vulgate is evidently influenced by this parallel, as it has <span class="accented">thesaurizastis tram.</span>) For the last days; rather, <span class="accented">in the last days</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x1f71;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm">2 Timothy 3:1</a>. If the words are connected with <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1fe6;&#x3c1;</span> as suggested above, there is no difficulty in them. If the punctuation of the A.V. be retained, we must suppose that the writer is speaking from the point of view of the last day of all. "When the end came it found them heaping up treasures which they could never use" (Dean Scott). But the other view, though not so generally adopted, seems fat' preferable. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Is cankered (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>Only here in New Testament, from &#x3b9;&#787;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, rust, as in the following sentence.
