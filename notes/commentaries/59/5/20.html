And there is some doctrinal mistake at the bottom of every practical mistake. There is no one habitually bad, but upon some bad principle. This is conversion; to turn a sinner from the error of his ways, not merely from one party to another, or from one notion and way of thinking to another. There is no way effectually and finally to hide sin, but forsaking it. Many sins are hindered in the party converted; many also may be so in others whom he may influence. The salvation of one soul is of infinitely greater importance than preserving the lives of multitudes, or promoting the welfare of a whole people. Let us in our several stations keep these things in mind, sparing no pains in God's service, and the event will prove that our labour is not in vain in the Lord. For six thousand years He has been multiplying pardons, and yet his free grace is not tired nor grown weary. Certainly Divine mercy is an ocean that is ever full and ever flowing. May the Lord give us a part in this abundant mercy, through the blood of Christ, and the sanctification of the Spirit.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let him know - Let him who converts the other know for his encouragement.<p>That he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way - Any sinner; anyone who has done wrong. This is a general principle, applicable to this case and to all others of the same kind. It is a universal truth that he who turns a sinner from a wicked path does a work which is acceptable to God, and which will in some way receive tokens of his approbation. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-3.htm">Deuteronomy 12:3</a>. No work which man can perform is more acceptable to God; none will be followed with higher rewards. In the language which is used here by the apostle, it is evidently intended not to deny that success in converting a sinner, or in reclaiming one from the error of his ways, is to be traced to the grace of God; but the apostle here refers only to the divine feeling towards the individual who shall attempt it, and the rewards which he may hope to receive. The reward bestowed, the good intended and done, would be the same as if the individual were able to do the work himself. God approves and loves his aims and efforts, though the success is ultimately to be traced to himself.<p>Shall save a soul from death - It has been doubted whether this refers to his own soul, or to the soul of him who is converted. Several manuscripts, and the Vulgate, Syriac, Arabic, and Coptic versions, here read: "his soul." The most natural interpretation of the passage is to refer it to the soul of the one converted, rather than of him who converts him. This accords better with the uniform teaching of the New Testament, since it is nowhere else taught that the method of saving our souls is by converting others; and this interpretation will meet all that the scope of the passage demands. The object of the apostle is to present a motive for endeavoring to convert one who has wandered away; and assuredly a sufficient motive for that is furnished in the fact, that by this means an immortal soul would be saved from eternal ruin. The word death here must refer to eternal death, or to future punishment. There is no other death which the soul is in danger of dying. The body dies and moulders away, but the soul is immortal. The apostle cannot mean that he would save the soul from annihilation, for it is in no danger of that. This passage proves, then, that there is a death which the soul may die; that there is a condition which may properly be called death as a consequence of sin; and that the soul will suffer that unless it is converted.<p>And shall hide a multitude of sins - Shall cover them over so that they shall not be seen; that is, they shall not be punished. This must mean either the sins which he has committed who is thus converted and saved, or the sins of him who converts him. Whichever is the meaning, a strong motive is presented for endeavoring to save a sinner from the error of his ways. It is not easy to determine which is the true sense. Expositors have been about equally divided respecting the meaning. Doddridge adopts substantially both interpretations, paraphrasing it, "not only procuring the pardon of those committed by the convert, but also engaging God to look with greater indulgence on his own character, and to be less ready to mark severely what he has done amiss." The Jews regarded it as a meritorious act to turn a sinner from the error of his ways, and it is possible that James may have had some of their maxims in his eye. Compare Clarke, in loc. Though it may not be possible to determine with certainty whether the apostle here refers to the sins of him who converts another, or of him who is converted, yet it seems to me that the reference is probably to the latter, for the following reasons:<p>(1) Such an interpretation will meet all that is fairly implied in the language.<p>(2) this interpretation will furnish a strong motive for what the apostle expects us to do. The motive presented is, according to this, that sin will not be punished. But this is always a good motive for putting forth efforts in the cause of religion, and quite as powerful when drawn from our doing good to others as when applied to ourselves.<p>(3) this is a safe interpretation; the other is attended with danger. According to this, the effort would be one of pure benevolence, and there would be no danger of depending on what we do as a ground of acceptance with God. The other interpretation would seem to teach that our sins might be forgiven on some other ground than that of the atonement - by virtue of some act of our own.<p>(4) and there might be danger, if it be supposed that this refers to the fact that our sins are to be covered up by this act, of supposing that by endeavoriug to convert others we may live in sin with impunity; that however we live, we shall be safe if we lead others to repentance and salvation.<p>If the motive be the simple desire to hide the sins of others - to procure their pardon - to save a soul from death, without any supposition that by that we are making an atonement for our own sins - it is a good one, a safe one. But if the idea is that by this act we are making some atonement for our own offences, and that we may thus work out a righteousness of our own, the idea is one that is every way dangerous to the great doctrine of justification by faith, and is contrary to the whole teaching of the Bible. For these reasons it seems to me that the true interpretation is, that the passage refers to the sins of others, not our own; and that the simple motive here presented is, that in this way we may save a fellow-sinner from being punished for his sins. It may be added, in the conclusion of the notes at this Epistle, that this motive is one which is sufficient to stimulate us to great and constant efforts to save others. Sin is the source of all the evil in the universe: and the great object which a benevolent heart ought to have, should be that its desolating effects may be stayed; that the sinner may be pardoned; and that the guilty soul may be saved from its consequences in the future world. This is the design of God in the plan of redemption; this was the object of the Saviour in giving himself to die; this is the purpose of the Holy Spirit in renewing and sanctifying the soul; and this is the great end of all those acts of Divine Providence by which the sinner is warned and turned to God. When we come to die, as we shall soon, it will give us more pleasure to be able to recollect that we have been the means of saying one soul from death, than to have enjoyed all the pleasures which sense can furnish, or to have gained all the honor and wealth which the world can give. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20.

The Greek verb in the middle voice requires this. Pr 10:12 refers to charity "covering" the sins of others before men; James to one's effecting by the conversion of another that that other's sins be covered before God, namely, with Christ's atonement. He effects this by making the convert partaker in the Christian covenant for the remission of all sins. Though this hiding of sins was included in the previous "shall save," James expresses it to mark in detail the greatness of the blessing conferred on the penitent through the converter's instrumentality, and to incite others to the same good deed.   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Of his way; </span> of his life and actions, which is contrary to the way which God hath prescribed. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall save; </span> men are said to save in the same way as to convert, viz. instrumentally. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A soul; </span> the soul of him that is thus converted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm" title="Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine; continue in them: for in doing this you shall both save yourself, and them that hear you.">1 Timothy 4:16</a></span>: <span class="ital">soul</span> for person, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">From death:</span> eternal death, unto which he was hastening while he continued in the error of his way, which led him toward destruction. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And shall hide a multitude of sins; </span> in the same sense as before he is said to convert and save his soul, viz. in being instrumental to bring him to faith and repentance, upon which God pardons, i.e. hides his sins, <span class="ital">{<span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/32-1.htm" title="Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is covered.">Psalm 32:1</a></span>}</span> though not from the eye of his omniscience, yet from the eye of his vindictive justice, and so as not to bring them forth in judgment against him. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/james/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let him know,.... And observe it for his encouragement: <p>that he which converteth a sinner from the error of his way; who is the instrument of restoring a backsliding professor, for such an one is meant by a sinner, and not a profane person; or of turning a poor bewildered believer, who is got out of the way of truth and holiness, into the right way again; or of convincing him of the error of his way, whether it be in point of doctrine, or of duty; and so of bringing him to the fold of Christ again, from whence he has strayed: <p>shall save a soul from death; not efficiently, but instrumentally, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-16.htm">1 Timothy 4:16</a> for otherwise Christ is the only Saviour; and he will be the means of saving "a soul", which is of more worth than a world; and that from death, the second death which lies in the separation of the soul from God, and in a sense of his wrath; which apostasy threatens with, and leads unto, if grace prevents not. The Alexandrian copy and others, and the Vulgate Latin version read, "his soul"; but the common reading is more emphatic; the Syriac and Arabic versions render it, "his own soul"; and the Ethiopic version, "himself", as respecting him that is the instrument of the conversion of the other, and not the person converted: <p>and shall hide a multitude of sins; either "his own", as the same versions read; and then the sense is, he shall be blessed with a discovery and application of the forgiveness of all his sins, though they have been many and great; or rather the sins of the person converted. Sin is only covered by the blood and righteousness of Christ; and thereby it is so covered, as not to be seen by the eye of vindictive justice and in such manner as that the persons of those who are covered therewith are all fair, without fault and unreproveable in the sight of God; and though their sins are many, even a multitude, they are blotted out as a thick cloud, and are abundantly pardoned; yea, all their sins are covered, be they ever so many, for God forgives all trespasses, for Christ's sake; and the blood of Christ cleanses from all sin, and his righteousness justifies from all: and whoever is an instrument of bringing a backslider to a sense of the evil of his ways, and to true repentance for the same; as he, upon such repentance, has his iniquities caused to pass from him, or, in other words, to be covered, as from the sight of God, so from his own; he may be said to be the instrument of this also. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm" title="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">Jam 5:20</a> forms the apodosis.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γινωσκέτω</span>] The <span class="greekheb">τις</span> mentioned in the second half of the preceding verse is the subject—the converter and not the converted.

Correctly Wiesinger: “<span class="greekheb">καλύψει</span> carries on further the <span class="greekheb">σώσει ψυχήν</span>, and states the ground of this salvation.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[1] Wiesinger: “<span class="greekheb">ὁ ἐπιστρέψας</span> is not to be taken as equivalent to <span class="ital">he who</span>, in strict reference to the subject of <span class="greekheb">γινωσκέτω</span>, but expresses the general idea that every one who converts a sinner performs a great work; it is the general statement, under which he who is designated by <span class="greekheb">γινωσκέτω</span> subordinates his doing.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[2] De Wette takes objection to the strong expression <span class="greekheb">πλῆθος</span>, as he thinks that the reference here is only to <span class="ital">aberration</span>, and not to a vicious life; and on this account he will consider, along with this, the sins of those who stand in reciprocal action with him who has erred, and were or might have been injured and led astray by him; but without reason; especially <span class="greekheb">πλῆθος ἁμαρτιῶν</span> corresponds entirely to the idea <span class="greekheb">πλανηθῆναι ἀπὸ τῆς ἀληθείας</span>, provided it be not arbitrarily weakened (so also Brückner).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[3] “In order to give prominence to the noble historical import of the Epistle, which has been only too much missed and neglected,” Lange maintains that James here, at the conclusion, invites the believing part of his people to engage in intercession and in “the work of salvation, that many individuals may be saved from death, and a multitude of sins might be atoned for.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-20.htm" title="Let him know, that he which converts the sinner from the error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide a multitude of sins.">Jam 5:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">γινώσκετε</span>: taking this as an indicative one may regard the words that follow as a quotation, a course which commends itself owing to the comparatively large number of quotations with which the Epistle abounds; at the same time it must be remembered that the weight of MS. evidence is in favour of <span class="greekheb">γινωσκέτε</span>.—<span class="greekheb">καλύψει</span> … (Hebrew <span class="greekheb">כפר</span>) <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm" title="And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves: for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.">1 Peter 4:8</a>, one of the strongest of the many marks of Jewish authorship which the Epistle contains; according to Jewish doctrine good works balance evil ones; the good work of converting a sinner is reckoned here as one of the most efficacious in obliterating evil deeds; on the whole subject see Introduction IV., § 2.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">from the error of his way</span>] The noun always involves the idea of being deceived as well as erring.

It occurs also in the LXX. of <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/85-2.htm" title="You have forgiven the iniquity of your people, you have covered all their sin.

The Hebrew, and English version, of <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm" title="Hatred stirs up strifes: but love covers all sins.">Proverbs 10:12</a> present a still closer parallel, but the LXX. seems to have followed a different text, and gives “Friendship covers all those that are not contentious.” The context leaves hardly any room for doubt that the “sins” which are thought of as covered are primarily those of the man converted, and not those of the converter. There is, however, a studied generality in the form of the teaching, which seems to emphasise the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The absence of any formal close to the Epistle is in many ways remarkable.

Amen.">1 John 5:21</a>. It is a possible explanation of this peculiarity, that we have lost the conclusion of the Epistle. It is, however, more probable that the abruptness is that of emphasis.

The same expression occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-8.htm">1 Peter 4:8</a>, "Charity covereth a multitude of <span class="accented">sins."</span> It is founded on <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/10-12.htm">Proverbs 10:12</a>, <span class="hebrew">&#x5ea;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5db;&#x5b7;&#x5e1;&#x5bc;&#x5b6;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d0;&#x5b7;&#x5d4;&#x5b2;&#x5d1;&#x5b8;&#x5d4;&#x20;&#x5d5;&#x5b0;&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;&#x20;&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c1;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, "Love covereth all <span class="accented">sins</span>," where the LXX. goes entirely astray: <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x1f71;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x1f72;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f7b;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>: but cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/31-1.htm">Psalm 31:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-3.htm">Psalm 84:3</a>, in the LXX. It is difficult to believe that St. Peter and St. James independently hit upon the rendering <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> for the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b8;&#x5dc;&#x5be;&#x5e4;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;&#x5e9;&#x5c2;&#x5b8;&#x5e2;&#x5b4;&#x5d9;&#x5dd;</span>, as there was nothing to suggest it, the LXX. never rendering <span class="hebrew">&#x5db;&#x5bc;&#x5b9;&#x5dc;</span> by <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x1fc6;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>. Probably the one was consciously or unconsciously influenced by the other. The striking position which the words occupy <span class="accented">here</span>, <span class="accented">as</span> those with which the Epistle closes, would make them linger in the memory; and there is nothing to militate against the conclusion, which appeared probable on the occasion of previous coincidences between the two writers, that St. James is the earlier of the two (comp. on James 4:6). The expression used by the apostle leaves it undetermined <span class="accented">whose</span> sins are thus "covered," whether <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> those of the man who is "<span class="accented">converted</span> from the error of his way," or <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> those of the man who wins him back, and through this good action obtains, by the grace of God, pardon for his own "multitude of sins." It has been well noticed that "<span class="accented">there</span> is a studied generality in the form of the teaching which seems to emphasize the wide blessedness of love. In the very act of seeking to convert one for whom we care we must turn to God ourselves, and in covering the past sins of another our own also are covered. In such an act love reaches its highest point, and that love includes the faith in God which is the condition of forgiveness" (Plumptre). The Epistle ends abruptly, with no salutation and no doxology. In this it stands almost by itself in the New Testament; the First Epistle of St. John alone approaching it in the abruptness of its conclusion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> </body></html>
