Observe the immediate future of the misery; it is already coming. Doubtless by this was meant primarily the pillage and destruction of Jerusalem, but under that first intention many others secondary and similar are included: for all “riches certainly make themselves wings” and fly away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/23-5.htm" title="Will you set your eyes on that which is not? for riches certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle toward heaven.">Proverbs 23:5</a>). Calvin and others of his school fail to see in this passage an exhortation of the rich to penitence, but only a denunciation of woe upon them; in the sense, however, that all prophecy, whether evil or good, is conditional, there is sufficient room to believe that no irrevocable doom was pronounced by “a Christian Jeremiah.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">James 5:1</a></span>. The unbelieving Jews, being exceedingly addicted to sensual pleasure, and very covetous, were of course grievous oppressors of the poor. Wherefore, to alarm these wicked men, and, if possible, to bring them to repentance, St. James, in the first paragraph of this chapter, sets before them, in the most lively colours, the miseries which the Romans, the instruments of the divine vengeance, were about to bring on the Jewish people, both in Judea and everywhere else, now deserted of God for their crimes, and particularly for the great crime of murdering the <span class="ital">Just One, </span>Jesus of Nazareth, their long-expected Messiah. So that, being soon to lose their possessions and goods, it was not only criminal, but foolish, by injustice and oppression to amass wealth, of which they were soon to be stripped. In this part of his letter the apostle hath introduced figures and expressions which, for boldness, vivacity, and energy, might have been used by the greatest tragic poet. See Macknight. <span class="ital">Go to now </span>— Or, <span class="ital">come now, ye rich men </span>— The apostle does not speak this so much for the sake of the rich themselves, as of the poor children of God, who were then groaning under their cruel oppression. <span class="ital">Weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you — </span>Quickly and unexpectedly. The miseries of which he speaks were those which our Lord had pointed out in his prophecy of the destruction of Jerusalem, and in which this apostle foresaw they would soon be involved; miseries arising from famine, pestilence, and the sword. These fell heaviest on the Jews in Judea. But they extended also to the Jews in the provinces. The reader who desires to see a particular account of these calamities, may read Josephus’s history of the Jewish war, where he will find scenes of misery laid open not to be paralleled in the annals of any nation. And as these were an awful prelude of that wrath which was to fall upon them in the world to come, so this passage may likewise refer to the final vengeance which will then be executed on the impenitent.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:1-6 Public troubles are most grievous to those who live in pleasure, and are secure and sensual, though all ranks suffer deeply at such times. All idolized treasures will soon perish, except as they will rise up in judgment against their possessors. Take heed of defrauding and oppressing; and avoid the very appearance of it. God does not forbid us to use lawful pleasures; but to live in pleasure, especially sinful pleasure, is a provoking sin. Is it no harm for people to unfit themselves for minding the concerns of their souls, by indulging bodily appetites? The just may be condemned and killed; but when such suffer by oppressors, this is marked by God. Above all their other crimes, the Jews had condemned and crucified that Just One who had come among them, even Jesus Christ the righteous.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Go to now - Notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-13.htm">James 4:13</a>.<p>Ye rich men - Not all rich men, but only that class of them who are specified as unjust and oppressive. There is no sin in merely being rich; where sin exists peculiarly among the rich, it arises from the manner in which wealth is acquired, the spirit which it tends to engender in the heart, and the way in which it is used. Compare the <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-24.htm">Luke 6:24</a> note; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-9.htm">1 Timothy 6:9</a> note.<p>Weep and howl - Greek: "Weep howling." This would be expressive of very deep distress. The language is intensive in a high degree, showing that the calamities which were coming upon them were not only such as would produce tears, but tears accompanied with loud lamentations. In the East, it is customary to give expression to deep sorrow by loud outcries. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm">Isaiah 14:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-7.htm">Isaiah 16:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-8.htm">Jeremiah 4:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-2.htm">Jeremiah 47:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-5.htm">Joel 1:5</a>.<p>For your miseries that shall come upon you - Many expositors, as Benson, Whitby, Macknight, and others, suppose that this refers to the approaching destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans, and to the miseries which would be brought in the siege upon the Jewish people, in which the rich would be the peculiar objects of cupidity and vengeance. They refer to passages in Josephus, which describe particularly the sufferings to which the rich were exposed; the searching of their houses by the zealots, and the heavy calamities which came upon them and their families. But there is no reason to suppose that the apostle referred particularly to those events. The poor as well as the rich suffered in that siege, and there were no such special judgments then brought upon the rich as to show that they were the marked objects of the divine displeasure. It is much more natural to suppose that the apostle means to say that such men as he here refers to exposed themselves always to the wrath of God, and that they had great reason to weep in the anticipation of his vengeance. The sentiments here expressed by the apostle are not applicable merely to the Jews of his time. If there is any class of men which has special reason to dread the wrath of God at all times, it is just the class of men here referred to. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>Jas 5:1-20.

All rich men are not here designed; there are some rich men who are good men, and make a good use of their riches, and do not abuse them, as these here are represented; and yet wicked rich men, or those that were the openly profane, are not here intended neither; for the apostle only writes to such who were within the church, and not without, who were professors of religion; and such rich men are addressed here, who, notwithstanding their profession, were not rich towards God, but laid up treasure for themselves, and trusted in their riches, and boasted of the multitude of their wealth; and did not trust in God, and make use of their substance to his glory, and the good of his interest, as they should have done: <p>weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon you; meaning, not temporal calamities that should come upon them at the destruction of Jerusalem, in which the rich greatly suffered by the robbers among themselves, as well as by the Roman soldiers; for the apostle is not writing to the Jews in Judea, and at Jerusalem; but to the Christians of the twelve tribes scattered in the several parts of the world, and who were not distressed by that calamity; but eternal miseries, or the torments of hell are intended, which, unless they repented of their sins, would shortly, suddenly, and unavoidably come upon them, when their present joy and laughter would be turned into howling and weeping. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Go <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> to now, <i>ye</i> rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come upon <i>you</i>.</span><p>(1) He denounces utter destruction to the wicked and profane rich men, and such as are drowned in their riotousness, mocking their foolish confidence when there is nothing indeed more vain than such things.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>.

Correctly Calvin: falluntur qui Jacobum hic exhortari ad poenitentiam divites putant; mihi simplex magis denuntiatio judicii Dei videtur, qua eos terrere voluit absque spe veniae.[215] James already sees the judgment coming upon the rich, therefore the call <span class="greekheb">κλαύσατε</span>; that for which they should weep are the <span class="greekheb">ταλαιπωρίαι</span> which threatened them.[216]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The <span class="ital">imperative</span> is not here used instead of the future (Semler: stilo prophetico imperat, ut rem certissimam demonstret, <span class="ital">flebitis;</span> Schneckenburger: aoristus imperativi rem mox certoque eventuram designat), but is to be retained in its full force. The imperative expresses not what they will do, but what they shall even now do, because their <span class="greekheb">ταλαιπωρίαι</span> are nigh. The union of the imperative <span class="greekheb">κλαύσατε</span> with the participle <span class="greekheb">ὀλολύζοντες</span> is not an imitation of the frequent combination of the finite verb with the infinite absolute of the same verb in the Hebrew (Schneckenburger), since here <span class="ital">two different</span> verbs are united together (de Wette, Wiesinger); also <span class="greekheb">ὀλολύζειν</span> has not the same meaning as <span class="greekheb">κλαίειν</span>, but, as expressive of a more vehement affection, is added for the sake of strength. <span class="greekheb">ὀλολύζειν</span> frequently in the O.

Thomas Aquinas, Grotius, Mill, Benson, Michaelis, Stier, Lange, Bouman refer this to the then impending destruction of Jerusalem; they are so far right, as the destruction of Jerusalem and the last judgment had not as yet been distinguished in representation;[217] but it is incorrect to refer it to the <span class="ital">judgment</span> itself, rather than to the <span class="ital">miseries which will precede the advent of Christ;</span> or with Hottinger, to find here only a description of the inconstancy of prosperity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ταῖς ἐπερχομέναις</span>] not <span class="ital">sc.</span> <span class="greekheb">ὑμῖν</span> (Luther: your misery which will come <span class="ital">upon you</span>; so also de Wette, Lange, and others), but <span class="ital">the impending, already threatening miseries;</span> comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-7.htm" title="That in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Christ Jesus.">Ephesians 2:7</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[214] Whilst de Wette, Wiesinger, and others understand by the rich here addressed Christians, Stier has correctly recognised that such are here addressed “who are outside of the Christian church,” namely, those already mentioned in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor.

Whatever the reasons were which brought about the belief, it is certain that the expression “those days” came to be applied to a certain period which was immediately to <span class="ital">precede</span> the coming of the Messiah; without doubt a number of prophetical passages were regarded as suggesting this (see below). The descriptions given of these “days,” which are to foretell the advent of the Messiah, belong to apocalyptic conceptions; in their general outline the “signs” of these times are identical. Prophetical passages such as the following laid the foundation: “The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is laid up in store. The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him …”; then, on the other hand, “I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death …” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hosea/13-12.htm" title="The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid....">Hosea 13:12-14</a>); again. “… The day of thy watchmen, even thy visitation, is come; now shall be their perplexity.

The great diffusion and immense popularity which the apocalyptic literature enjoyed makes it certain that the writer of our Epistle was familiar with the subject; the “miseries,” therefore, referred to in the passage before us may quite possibly have reference to the sufferings which were to take place in the time of travail preceding the actual coming of the Messiah.—<span class="greekheb">ὀλολύζοντες</span>: only here in the N.T., but fairly frequent in the Septuagint, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.">Isaiah 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-5.htm" title="Awake, you drunkards, and weep; and howl, all you drinkers of wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your mouth.">Joel 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/1-13.htm" title="Gird yourselves, and lament, you priests: howl, you ministers of the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, you ministers of my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is withheld from the house of your God.">Joel 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-8.htm" title="For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us.">Jeremiah 4:8</a>, etc.; in the first of these passages the connection is the same as here, … <span class="greekheb">ἐγγὺς γὰρ ἡμέρα κυρίου</span>, and see <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/6-24.htm" title="But woe to you that are rich! for you have received your consolation.">Luke 6:24</a>, “Woe unto you rich …,” which is strongly reminiscent of the verse before us.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you....">James 5:1-6</a>.

The word for “howl,” not found elsewhere in the New Testament, is found in three consecutive chapters of Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-6.htm" title="Howl you; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as a destruction from the Almighty.">Isaiah 13:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-31.htm" title="Howl, O gate; cry, O city; you, whole Palestina, are dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and none shall be alone in his appointed times.">Isaiah 14:31</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-3.htm" title="In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one shall howl, weeping abundantly.">Isaiah 15:3</a>), which may well have been present to St James’ thoughts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for your miseries that shall come upon you</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">that are coming upon you</span>, in the very act to come. The context points to these as consisting not merely in the cares and anxieties that come in the common course of things upon the rich, but in the special troubles that were to usher in the advent of the Judge. Historically, the words had their primary fulfilment in the woes that preceded the destruction of Jerusalem, but these were but the first in the series of “springing and germinant accomplishments” which will attain their completeness before the final Advent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you.">Jam 5:1</a>. <span class="greekheb">Οἱ πλούσιοι</span>, <span class="ital">ye rich men</span>) [<span class="ital">who have neglected the true enjoyment of riches in doing good</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-2.htm" title="Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are moth-eaten....">Jam 5:2-3</a>.—V. g.] In the writings of the prophets, foreign nations are often addressed by apostrophe, although the prophecy would not come into their hands, but to the Jews. Under the same figure, the apostle speaks of the rich, though he does not so much write to the rich themselves, who are destitute of faith, as to the saints, that they may be induced to bear with patience the violence of the rich, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord.
