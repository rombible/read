James was not advocating a religion alien to that of Moses, but building again more widely “the ruins of the tabernacle which had fallen down,” that “all the Gentiles might seek after the Lord.” (Comp. his speech in the synod, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/15-13.htm" title="And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brothers, listen to me:">Acts 15:13-21</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience....">James 5:10-11</a></span>. <span class="ital">Take the prophets </span>— Once persecuted like you, even for <span class="ital">speaking in the name of the Lord </span>— The very men that gloried in having the prophets, yet could not bear their message.

The apostle’s mentioning this immediately after he had proposed the prophets as an example of patience in suffering, shows that he herein alludes to Christ’s words, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm" title="Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake.">Matthew 5:11</a>,) <span class="ital">Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, &c., for so persecuted they the prophets that were before you.

If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Take, my brethren, the prophets - That is, in your trials and persecutions.

And therefore the apostle proposes them to be taken, <p>for an example suffering affliction, and of patience; their afflictions were many and great, and yet they were very patient under them; and through faith and patience they went through them, and now inherit the promises; and so are a very proper example and pattern for New Testament saints to follow and copy after. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{6}</span> Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience.</span><p>(6) Because most men will object, that it is good to repel injuries by whatever means, he contrasts that with the examples of the fathers whose patience had a most happy end, because God as a most bountiful Father, never forsakes his.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-10.htm" title="Take, my brothers, the prophets, who have spoken in the name of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of patience....">Jam 5:10-11</a>.
