Be ye also patient</span>.—It becomes you, the just, to bear with the unjust till God work the end of your trial, and prove them at the same time. Again and again, through several verses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain.">James 5:7-11</a>), St. James repeats his advice, emphasising it with various reasons: the nearness of deliverance; the Judge standing at the gate; the example of the prophets—persecuted by men, and therefore blessed of God; the hope of those who endure—Job for example: the very faithfulness and tender mercy of the Lord, bringing all things to a perfect end. Few ideas are more startling (is a reflection of Dr. Evans) than those produced by the strange combinations in Scripture. Matters are joined there which we mostly put asunder here, speaking of them, at least, as apart. And thus we read in the Revelation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-9.htm" title="Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:">James 1:9</a>) of the <span class= "ital">kingdom and patience</span> of Jesus Christ. But all Christians are citizens of a patient kingdom; the King thereof is more patient, as He hath greater need of patience than His subjects, and He is patient, because He is strong. Impatience is a sign of weakness. God can afford to wait, for His time is eternity. And we can be strong in His strength, and wait also in patience. In so far as St. James’s hearers were earthly minded, they could not learn this lesson; so often with ourselves we would have our wrong righted instantly, and to the full. Only one view of life can alter this, viz., the lifting of our gaze from earth to heaven, remembering that “the time is short” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-29.htm" title="But this I say, brothers, the time is short: it remains, that both they that have wives be as though they had none;">1Corinthians 7:29</a>).<p><span class= "bld">The early and latter rain.</span>—It is, perhaps, just as well to recollect there were only two seasons of rainfall in the Holy Land, and, if long delayed, famine was a certain result. With the change of the Israelites from pastoral life to agricultural, the malignity of these dearths was lessened; but they were and are still severe. The Bible mentions many such—<span class= "ital">e.g., </span>in the days of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-10.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land.">Genesis 12:10</a>), Isaac (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-1.htm" title="And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went to Abimelech king of the Philistines to Gerar.">Genesis 26:1</a>), Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/42-2.htm" title="And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt: get you down thither, and buy for us from there; that we may live, and not die.">Genesis 42:2</a>), Ruth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-1.htm" title="James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.">James 1:1</a>), Samuel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/21-1.htm" title="Then there was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year; and David inquired of the LORD.

And there was a sore famine in Samaria.">1Kings 18:2</a>). The “early rain” fell during the autumn sowing—in October, November, and December; “the latter” in March and April.

If you should be called to wait longer than the husbandman, is not there something more worth waiting for? In every sense the coming of the Lord drew nigh, and all his people's losses, hardships, and sufferings, would be repaid. Men count time long, because they measure it by their own lives; but all time is as nothing to God; it is as a moment. To short-lived creatures a few years seem an age; but Scripture, measuring all things by the existence of God, reckons thousands of years but so many days. God brought about things in Job's case, so as plainly to prove that he is very pitiful and of tender mercy. This did not appear during his troubles, but was seen in the event, and believers now will find a happy end to their trials. Let us serve our God, and bear our trials, as those who believe that the end will crown all. Our eternal happiness is safe if we trust to him: all else is mere vanity, which soon will be done with for ever.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Be patient therefore, brethren - That is, under such wrongs as the apostle had described in the previous verses. Those whom he addressed were doubtless suffering under those oppressions, and his object was to induce them to bear their wrongs without murmuring and without resistance. One of the methods of doing this was by showing them, in an address to their rich oppressors, that those who injured and wronged them would be suitably punished at the day of judgment, or that their cause was in the hands of God; and another method of doing it was by the direct inculcation of the duty of patience. Compare the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-38.htm">Matthew 5:38-41</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/5-43.htm">Matthew 5:43-45</a>. The margin here is, "be long patient," or "suffer with long patience." The sense of the Greek is, "be long-suffering, or let not your patience be exhausted. Your courage, vigor, and forbearance is not to be short-lived, but is to be enduring. Let it continue as long as there is need of it, even to the coming of the Lord. Then you will be released from sufferings."<p>Unto the coming of the Lord - The coming of the Lord Jesus - either to remove you by death, or to destroy the city of Jerusalem and bring to an end the Jewish institutions, or to judge the world and receive his people to himself. The "coming of the Lord" in any way was an event which Christians were taught to expect, and which would be connected with their deliverance from troubles. As the time of his appearing was not revealed, it was not improper to refer to that as an event that might possibly be near; and as the removal of Christians by death is denoted by the phrase "the coming of the Lord" - that is, his coming to each one of us - it was not improper to speak of death in that view. On the general subject of the expectations entertained among the early Christians of the second advent of the Saviour, see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-51.htm">1 Corinthians 15:51</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:2-3</a> note.<p>Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth - The farmer waits patiently for the grain to grow. It requires time to mature the crop, and he does not become impatient. The idea seems to be, that we should wait for things to develop themselves in their proper season, and should not be impatient before that season arrives. In due time we may expect the harvest to be ripened. We cannot hasten it. We cannot control the rain, the sun, the season; and the farmer therefore patiently waits until in the regular course of events he has a harvest. So we cannot control and hasten the events which are in God's own keeping; and we should patiently wait for the developments of his will, and the arrangements of his providence, by which we may obtain what we desire.<p>And hath long patience for it - That is, his patience is not exhausted. It extends through the whole time in which, by the divine arrangements, he may expect a harvest.<p>Until he receive the early and latter rain - In the climate of Palestine there are two rainy seasons, on which the harvest essentially depends - the autumnal and the spring rains - called here and elsewhere in the Scriptures the early and the latter rains. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/29-23.htm">Job 29:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>. The autumnal or early rains of Scripture, usually commence in the latter half of October or the beginning of November; not suddenly, but by degrees, which gives opportunity for the husbandman to sow his fields of wheat and barley. The rains come mostly from the west or south-west, continuing for two or three days at a time, and falling especially during the nights. The wind then chops round to the north or east, and several days of fine weather succeed. During the months of November and December the rains continue to fail heavily; afterwards they return only at longer intervals, and are less heavy; but at no period during the winter do they entirely cease to occur.<p>Snow often falls in Jerusalem, in January and February, to the depth of a foot or more, but it does not last long. Rain continues to fall more or less through the month of March, but it is rare after that period. At the present time there are not any particular periods of rain, or successions of showers, which might be regarded as distinct rainy seasons. The whole period from October to March now constitutes only one continued rainy season, without any regularly intervening time of prolonged fair weather. Unless, therefore, there has been some change in the climate since the times of the New Testament, the early and the latter rains for which the husbandman waited with longing, seem rather to have implied the first showers of autumn, which revived the parched and thirsty earth, and prepared it for the seed; and the latter showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward the ripening crops and the vernal products of the fields. In ordinary seasons, from the cessation of the showers in spring until their commencement in October or November, rain never falls, and the sky is usually serene. - Robinson's Biblical Researches, vol. ii., pp. 96-100. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. Be patient therefore&#8212;as judgment is so near (Jas 5:1, 3), ye may well afford to be "patient" after the example of the unresisting Just one (Jas 5:6).<p>brethren&#8212;contrasted with the "rich" oppressors, Jas 5:1-6.<p>unto the coming of the Lord&#8212;Christ, when the trial of your patience shall cease.<p>husbandman waiteth for&#8212;that is, patiently bears toils and delays through hope of the harvest at last. Its "preciousness" (compare Ps 126:6, "precious seed") will more than compensate for all the past. Compare the same image, Ga 6:3, 9.<p>hath long patience for it&#8212;"over it," in respect to it.<p>until he receive&#8212;"until it receive" [Alford]. Even if English Version be retained, the receiving of the early and latter rains is not to be understood as the object of his hope, but the harvest for which those rains are the necessary preliminary. The early rain fell at sowing time, about November or December; the latter rain, about March or April, to mature the grain for harvest. The latter rain that shall precede the coming spiritual harvest, will probably be another Pentecost-like effusion of the Holy Ghost.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord; </span> viz. to judgment, and that either particular, to avenge the quarrels of innocent sufferers upon their tyrannical persecutors; or rather, to the general judgment, in which a full retribution is to be made both to the just and unjust, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-5.htm" title="But after your hardness and impenitent heart treasure up to yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;">Romans 2:5</a>,6</span>, &c.

The apostle here addresses himself to the poor who were oppressed by the rich men, and these he calls "brethren" of whom he was not ashamed; when he does not bestow this title upon the rich, though professors of the same religion: these poor brethren he advises to be patient under their sufferings, to bear them with patience, <p>unto the coming of the Lord; not to destroy Jerusalem, but either at death, or at the last, judgment; when he will take vengeance on their oppressors, and deliver them from all their troubles, and put them into the possession of that kingdom, and glory, to which they are called; wherefore, in the mean while, he would have them be quiet and easy, not to murmur against God, nor seek to take vengeance on men, but leave it to God, to whom it belongs, who will judge his people: <p>behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth; ripe fruit, which arises from the seed he sows in the earth; and which may be called "precious", because useful both to man and beast; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-14.htm">Deuteronomy 33:14</a> and between this, and the sowing of the seed, is a considerable time, during which the husbandman waits; and this may be an instruction in the present case: <p>and hath patience for it until he receive the early and latter rain; the Jews had seldom rains any more than twice a year; the early, or former rain, was shortly after the feast of tabernacles (u), in the month Marchesvan, or October, when the seed was sown in the earth; and if it did not rain, they prayed for it, on the third or seventh day of the month (w); and the latter rain was in Nisan, or March (x), just before harvest; and to this distinction the passage refers. <p>(u) Bartenora in Misn.

The section 7–11 is a Christian adaptation of the earlier Jewish conception of the Messianic Era; in place of <span class="greekheb">αἱ ἐσχάται ἡμέραι</span> there is <span class="greekheb">ἡ παρουσία τοῦ Κυρίου</span>, the one a specifically Jewish, the other a specifically Christian expression; the two expressions, which represent, as it were, the titles of Jewish and Christian Eschatology respectively, are sufficient to show the difference of <span class="ital">venue</span> regarding these two sections. It is characteristic of one type of apocalyptic literature that the central figure of the Messiah is not mentioned, while another type lays great emphasis on the Messianic Personality; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-1.htm" title="Go to now, you rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that shall come on you....">Jam 5:1-6</a> represents the former of these; that it contains no trace of Christian interpolation is the more remarkable in that it is utilised by a Jewish-Christian writer and is incorporated in Christian literature. The fact is additional evidence in favour of its being a quotation,—one of several which our Epistle contains. It is christianised by the addition to it of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain....">Jam 5:7-11</a>, which, though interspersed with O.T. reminiscences, is specifically Christian. A similar christianising of Jewish material by adding to it is found, though on a much smaller scale, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-20.htm" title="He which testifies these things said, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.">Revelation 22:20</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ἀμήν ἔρχου κύριε Ἰησοῦ</span>, which forms a response to the preceding <span class="greekheb">ναί</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἔρχομαι ταχύ</span>. Dr. Schiller-Szinessy (in <span class="ital">Encycl. Brit.</span>, art. “Midrash”) discovered that the Hebrew equivalent of the words <span class="greekheb">Ἀμήν ἔρχου</span> (= <span class="greekheb">אמן בא</span>) indicated acrostically a primitive hymn, which still appears in all the Jewish prayer books, and is known from its opening words as <span class="ital">En Kelohenu</span> (“There is none like our God”; see Singer’s <span class="ital">The Authorised Daily Prayer Book</span>, p. 167). This hymn consists of five verses of four lines each; the first word of each line in the first verse begins with [60], of the second verse with <span class="greekheb">מ</span>, of the third with <span class="greekheb">נ</span>, of the fourth with <span class="greekheb">ב</span>, and of the fifth with [61], thus making a four-fold repetition of the formula <span class="greekheb">אמן בא</span> (= “Amen, Come”). This formula is the short title of the hymn referred to and “is actually written instead of the hymn in the place where it is to be used after the Additional Service for the New Year, and again towards the conclusion of the additional service for the eighth day of Solemn Assembly …, at the end of the Feast of Tabernacles” (Taylor, <span class="ital">The Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</span>, pp. 78 ff., and see Box in <span class="ital">Church and Synagogue</span>, iii., pp. 41 ff.). The formula “Amen Bo” belonged to Jewish Eschatology, and possibly took its origin from the phrase <span class="greekheb">עולם הבא</span> (= “The age to come,” a common expression for the Messianic Era); it is christianised by the Jewish-Christian writer in the Apocalypse by the addition of <span class="greekheb">κύριε Ἰησοῦ</span>, just as in the passage before us the second, obviously Christian, section <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/5-7.htm" title="Be patient therefore, brothers, to the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, and has long patience for it, until he receive the early and latter rain....">Jam 5:7-11</a>, is added on to the former, quite as obviously Jewish, in order to make the whole Christian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[60] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[61] Codex Sinaiticus (sæc. iv.), now at St. Petersburg, published in facsimile type by its discoverer, Tischendorf, in 1862.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/5.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div>7–11. Comfort and Counsel for the Poor<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">Be patient therefore</span>] More literally, <span class="bld">Be long-suffering</span>. The logical sequence implied in “therefore” is that the “brethren” whom St James addresses should follow the example of the ideal “just man” of whom the previous verse had spoken. There is a <span class="ital">terminus ad quem</span> for that long-suffering, and it is found in “the coming of the Lord.” Here, with scarcely the shadow of a doubt, it is the Lord Jesus who is meant. St James had learned from the discourse recorded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm" title="And as he sat on the mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when shall these things be? and what shall be the sign of your coming, and of the end of the world?">Matthew 24:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-37.htm" title="But as the days of Noe were, so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-39.htm" title="And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away; so shall also the coming of the Son of man be.">Matthew 24:39</a>, to think of that Advent as redressing the evils of the world, and he shared the belief, natural in that age of the Church, that it was not far off. It had already drawn nigh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-8.htm" title="Be you also patient; establish your hearts: for the coming of the Lord draws near.">James 5:8</a>). The patient expectation of the sufferers would not be frustrated. We see that the hope was not fulfilled as men expected, but we may believe that even for those who cherished it, it was not in vain. There was a judgment at hand, in which evil-doers received their just reward, and which made glad the hearts of the righteous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">hath long patience for it</span>] The verb is the same as that just translated “be patient.” Better, perhaps, <span class="bld">is long-suffering over it</span>, as implying a kind of watchful expectancy. The prevalence of a long-continued drought in Palestine when St James wrote (see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/5-16.htm" title="Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another, that you may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man avails much.">James 5:16</a>) gave, we can scarcely doubt, a very special emphasis to his words of counsel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">until he receive the early and latter rain</span>] The MSS. present a singular variety of readings, some giving “rain,” some “fruit,” and some no substantive at all. “Rain” gives the best meaning. The “early rain” fell in the months from October to February; the latter, from March to the end of April. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm" title="That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season, the first rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your corn, and your wine, and your oil.">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-3.htm" title="Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there has been no latter rain; and you had a whore's forehead, you refused to be ashamed.">Jeremiah 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm" title="Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that gives rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he reserves to us the appointed weeks of the harvest.">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm" title="Be glad then, you children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD your God: for he has given you the former rain moderately, and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former rain, and the latter rain in the first month.">Joel 2:23</a>.

As was pointed out in the notes on James 1:3, it ordinarily refers to patience in respect of persons. Here, however, it certainly includes endurance in respect of things, so that the husbandman is said <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> where we should rather have expected <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;&#x3bd;</span> (cf.

It is also found in St. Paul's writings, only, however (in this sense), in Thessalonians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-19.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/3-13.htm">1 Thessalonians 3:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/5-23.htm">1 Thessalonians 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-1.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:1, 8</a>) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-23.htm">1 Corinthians 15:23</a>.

(For "<span class="accented">the</span> early and the latter rain," comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/11-14.htm">Deuteronomy 11:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-24.htm">Jeremiah 5:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-23.htm">Joel 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/10-1.htm">Zechariah 10:1</a>.) "The first showers of autumn which revived the parched and thirsty soil and prepared it for the seed; and the later showers of spring which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and the vernal products of the field" (Robinson, quoted in 'Dictionary of the Bible,' 2:994). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be patient (&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>From &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, long, and &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;, soul or spirit, but with the sense of strong passion, stronger even than &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3b7;&#769;, anger, as is maintained by Schmidt ("Synonymik"), who describes &#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; as a tumultuous welling up of the whole spirit; a mighty emotion which seizes and moves the whole inner man. Hence the restraint implied in &#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is most correctly expressed by long-suffering, which is its usual rendering in the New Testament. It is a patient holding out under trial; a long-protracted restraint of the soul from yielding to passion, especially the passion of anger. In the New Testament the word and its cognates are sometimes rendered by patient or patience, which conceals the distinction from &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;, uniformly rendered patience, and signifying persistent endurance, whether in action or suffering. As Trench observes, "&#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; is perseverantia and patientia both in one." Thus Bishop Ellicott: "The brave patience with which the Christian contends against the various hindrances, persecutions, and temptations that befall him in his conflict with the inward and outward world." &#x3a5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;. contains an element of manliness. Thus Plato joins it with the adverb &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, in a manly way, and contrasts it with &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;, unmanly, cowardly. &#x39c;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b8;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; is exercised toward persons; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769;, toward things. The former is ascribed to God as an attribute (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-7.htm">Luke 18:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-20.htm">1 Peter 3:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-9.htm">2 Peter 3:9</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-15.htm">2 Peter 3:15</a>), the latter never; for the God of patience (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-5.htm">Romans 15:5</a>) is the God who imparts patience to his children. "There can be no resistance to God nor burden upon him, the Almighty, from things. Therefore &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#769; cannot find place in him" (Trench). Rev. retains A. V., be patient. The thought links itself naturally with that in the preceding verse: the righteous doth not resist.<p>Therefore<p>Since things are so. Referring to the condition of things described in the previous passage.<p>Brethren<p>In contrast with the rich just addressed.<p>Waiteth (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c7;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;)<p>With expectation.

The early rain fell in October, November, and December, and extended into January and February. These rains do not come suddenly, but by degrees, so that the farmer can sow his wheat or barley. The rains are mostly from the west or southwest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-54.htm">Luke 12:54</a>), continuing two or three days at a time, and falling mostly in the night. Then the wind shifts to the north or east, and fine weather ensues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/25-23.htm">Proverbs 25:23</a>). The latter rains, which are much lighter, fall in March and April. Rain in harvest was regarded as a miracle (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-16.htm">1 Samuel 12:16-18</a>).
