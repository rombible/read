There is a force in the original sentence, which our own language cannot supply. The term “deceiving” is the contrary of that rendered “word,” and means its corruption; the Word which is the source of knowledge and life may be so handled as to cause error and death. No acquaintance with the Bible, apart from the practice of its precepts, will avail the Christian any more than it did the Jew. “For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers shall be justified” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>). Those who deceive themselves may not altogether be hypocrites; there is a subtler danger of being blind, and nevertheless exclaiming “We see.” (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/9-41.htm" title="Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin: but now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains.">John 9:41</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">James 1:22</a></span>. <span class="ital">But be ye doers of the word </span>— See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-21.htm" title="Not every one that said to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven.">Matthew 7:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24</a>. We are then doers of the word, when, being enlightened by its doctrines, awed by its threatenings, and encouraged by its promises, we, through the aid of divine grace, love and obey its precepts, both those which enjoin repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, as terms necessary to be complied with in order to our justification and regeneration, and those subsequent commands which show how those, who are already justified and born from above, ought to walk that they may please God, and save their souls; <span class="ital">and not hearers only </span>— Not contenting yourselves with mere hearing, or even with understanding and believing what you hear, without reducing it to practice; <span class="ital">deceiving your own selves</span> — As if it was sufficient to know your Master’s will without doing it. Some suppose that in these words the apostle refers primarily to the Jews, whose doctrine it was, 1st, That to be Abraham’s seed was sufficient to obtain for them God’s favour, and secure them against his judgments; 2d, That circumcision procured them acceptance with God; 3d, That all Israelites had a portion in the world to come; and especially, 4th, That to be employed in hearing and studying the law was of itself sufficient. But it seems more likely that he gives this caution with a reference to those Gnostics and other Antinomians that were creeping fast into the church; and were <span class="ital">hearers only, </span>not even considering the word they heard, and therefore not understanding it; and especially not experiencing its power to regenerate and save them from the guilt and power of their sins, and restore them to the divine image. The words, <span class="greekheb">παραλογιζομενοι εαυτους</span>, rendered, <span class="ital">deceiving your own selves, </span>properly signify, <span class="ital">imposing upon yourselves by sophistical reasonings; </span>an expression here used with great propriety, and very applicable to all those professors of Christianity who abuse the doctrines of grace to Antinomian purposes, and make void the moral law through a pretence of faith.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:22-25 If we heard a sermon every day of the week, and an angel from heaven were the preacher, yet, if we rested in hearing only, it would never bring us to heaven. Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it is our own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let the word of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us the corruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and it will tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the law discovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain do we hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy, instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hear the word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it for counsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spiritual life. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be, blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would be connected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divine revelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation, and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spirit of adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark the distinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but in his deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven. Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by his grace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only - Obey the gospel, and do not merely listen to it.

The nature of this deception was this, that they would imagine that that was all which was required, whereas the main thing was that they should be obedient. If a man supposes that by a mere punctual attendance on preaching, or a respectful attention to it, he has done all that is required of him, he is laboring under a most gross self-deception. And yet there are multitudes who seem to imagine that they have done all that is demanded of them when they have heard attentively the word preached. Of its influence on their lives, and its claims to obedience, they are utterly regardless. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>22.

The duty of doing as well as hearing is frequently insisted upon in Jewish writings. See, further, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:">Matthew 7:24</a>, etc. As to the precise meaning to be attached to <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> opinions differ; but the mention twice made of <span class="ital">hearing</span> the word makes it fairly certain that in the first instance—whatever further meaning it connoted—reference is being made to the reading of the Scriptures in the synagogue; further, the mention, also twice made, of the <span class="ital">doing</span> of the word makes it a matter of practical certainty that the reference is to the <span class="ital">Torah</span>, the Law; the fact that Jews are being addressed only emphasises this. For the attitude of the Jews towards the <span class="ital">Torah</span> during the centuries immediately preceding Christianity and onwards, see Oesterley and Box, <span class="ital">The Religion and Worship of the Synagogue</span>, pp. 135–151; here it must suffice to say that it was regarded as the final revelation of God for all time, that it was the means of salvation, and that its practice was the highest expression of loyalty towards God. Jews who had from childhood been taught to regard the <span class="ital">Torah</span> in this light would have found it very difficult to discard the time-honoured veneration accorded to it, and there was no need to do so, seeing the place that Christ Himself had given to it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-17.htm" title="Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill....">Matthew 5:17-18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-12.htm" title="Therefore all things whatever you would that men should do to you, do you even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.">Matthew 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm" title="Or have you not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-3.htm" title="All therefore whatever they bid you observe, that observe and do; but do not you after their works: for they say, and do not.">Matthew 23:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-26.htm" title="He said to him, What is written in the law? how read you?">Luke 10:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-17.htm" title="And it is easier for heaven and earth to pass, than one pronunciation mark of the law to fail.">Luke 16:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-29.htm" title="Abraham said to him, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them.">Luke 16:29</a>), and provided that its teaching in general was regarded as preparatory to the embracing of Christianity. The intensely practical writer of this passage realised that those to whom he was writing must be drawn gently and gradually, without unduly severing them from their earlier belief, which, after all, contained so much which was identical with the new faith. The <span class="ital">Torah</span>, which had been rooted in their hearts and which was to them, in the most literal sense, the word of God, was the point of attachment between Judaism and Christianity; it was utilised by the writer in order to bring them to Christ, the “Word” of God in a newer, higher sense. All that he says here about the <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> was actually the teaching of the Jews concerning the <span class="ital">Torah</span>, the revealed word of God; and all that he says was also equally true, only in a much higher sense, of the teaching of Christ, the “Word” of God,—this latter, higher conception of the “Word of God,” the <span class="greekheb">מימרא</span>, was one with which Hellenistic Jews were quite familiar;—what has been said can be illustrated thus:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-18.htm" title="Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of his creatures.">Jam 1:18</a> it is said, “Of his own will he brought us forth by the <span class="ital">word</span> of truth”; the Jews taught that they were the children of God by virtue of the <span class="ital">Torah</span>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-21.htm" title="Why lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word, which is able to save your souls.">Jam 1:21</a> it is said, “Wherefore putting away all filthiness … receive the rooted word”; according to Jewish ideas, purity and the <span class="ital">Torah</span> were inseparable, it was an ancient Jewish belief that the <span class="ital">Torah</span> was the means whereby lust was annihilated in a man. In the same verse, the expression <span class="greekheb">ἔμφυτος λόγος</span> can have a two-fold meaning in reference to the <span class="ital">Torah</span>; either it contains an allusion to the belief that the <span class="ital">Torah</span> was implanted, like Wisdom, in God Himself from the very beginning, hence the expression <span class="greekheb">ראשׁית</span> (“beginning”) used of the <span class="ital">Torah</span>; or else the writer is referring to the teaching of the <span class="ital">Torah</span> which was implanted, and therefore rooted, in every Jew from the earliest years. Once more, it is said that this word is able to save souls. Among the Jews it was an axiom that the <span class="ital">Torah</span> was the means of salvation; to give but one quotation illustrative of this ancient belief, in <span class="ital">Wajjikra Rabba</span>, 29 it is written: <span class="greekheb">אין אורח חיים אלא תורה</span> (“<span class="ital">Torah</span> is the only way that leadeth to life”). And finally, as already remarked, the necessity of being doers as well as hearers of the <span class="ital">Torah</span> is a commonplace in Jewish literature. For many illustrations showing the correctness of what has been said, see Weber, <span class="ital">Jüdische Theologie</span> (2nd Ed.), pp. 14–38, Bousset, <span class="ital">Die Religion des Judenthums</span> (1st Ed.), pp. 87–120, the various editions of <span class="ital">Midrashim</span> translated by Wünsche in “Bibliotheca Rabbinica,” and the handy collection being issued under the editorship of Fiebig, entitled “Ausgewählte Mischnatractate”. It will have been noticed that all that the writer of this passage says about <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span> as applicable to the Law, or <span class="ital">Torah</span>, is equally applicable, only in a much higher sense, to Christ; this will be obvious and need not be proved by quotations. But it is interesting to observe that apparently precisely the same thing was done by our Lord Himself, as recorded by St. John in the fourth Gospel; He adapted Jewish teaching on the <span class="ital">Torah</span> and applied it to Himself; for details of this, see Oesterley and Box, <span class="ital">op. cit.</span>, pp. 139 ff. It will be noticed that in our Epistle the writer presently goes on to substitute <span class="greekheb">νόμος</span> (<span class="ital">Torah</span>) for <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-25.htm" title="But whoever looks into the perfect law of liberty, and continues therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.">Jam 1:25</a>; this is very significant; the “perfect law of liberty,” and the “royal law,” both refer to the <span class="ital">Torah</span> as perfected by the “King of the Jews”.—<span class="greekheb">παραλογιζόμενοι ἑαυτούς</span>: <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, deceiving the heart, as it is expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a>; the rebuke shows the intimate knowledge on the part of the writer of the spiritual state of those to whom he is writing.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">22–25</span>. Doers and Hearers<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">22</span>. <span class="ital">But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only</span>] The thought is the same, though illustrated by a different similitude, as that of the closing verses of the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-24.htm" title="Therefore whoever hears these sayings of mine, and does them, I will liken him to a wise man, which built his house on a rock:...">Matthew 7:24-28</a>). The reference to the “hearers of the word” confirms the explanation given above of the Word of the Truth. It is not primarily the <span class="ital">written</span> word, for then we should have the “reader,” not the “hearer,” nor Christ as the Incarnate Word, but the spoken message from God to the soul of man—“<span class="ital">Be ye doers</span>;” literally, “<span class="bld">become</span>,” as though life were a continued process of such “becoming,” the condition not being that in which men find themselves by nature.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">deceiving your own selves</span>] The word is etymologically more definite than that commonly used for deceiving, and implies strictly the self-deception, if one may so speak, of bad logic. The hypocrite knew the major premiss; “The doers, not the hearers, are blessed,” but though conscience supplied the minor, “I am a hearer, not a doer,” he shut his eyes to it and failed to draw the conclusion. The use of the word in the LXX., as e. g. in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-7.htm" title="And your father has deceived me, and changed my wages ten times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.">Genesis 31:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/31-41.htm" title="Thus have I been twenty years in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your cattle: and you have changed my wages ten times.">Genesis 31:41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/8-29.htm" title="And Moses said, Behold, I go out from you, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.">Exodus 8:29</a>, shews, however, that it had come to be used in the general sense of “cheating” or “defrauding,” and it may be questioned, therefore, how far the special sense is to be pressed here.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div>[22. <span class="greekheb">Παραλογιζόμενοι ἐαυτοὺς</span>, <span class="ital">deceiving their</span> [“your”] <span class="ital">own selves</span>) Pleasing themselves in their hearing.—V. g.]<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 22.</span> - They are not merely to receive and <span class="accented">hear</span> the Word; they must also <span class="accented">act</span> upon it.
