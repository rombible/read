Shall we continue in sin, that grace may abound?">Romans 6:1</a>), or to suppose for one moment that God, and therefore power invincible, is drawing him from righteousness. Almost every reflection upon the nature of sin leads up to an inquiry as to its cause; and the enigma will hardly be solved in this life. The very facts of the presence of evil amongst God’s creatures, and its continual attraction even for the best, have often driven men to doubt His supremacy. Sadly—how can we of charity think otherwise?—some have felt the pain, but not the purpose of the world. At times they cannot see in nature “the work of a Being at once good and omnipotent,” and prefer to doubt the latter quality sooner than the former.<span class= "note">[14]</span> But this nineteenth-century conclusion is no advance beyond the dual system of the Persians, or rather, of Manes, who corrupted with his Indian fancies the faith of Zoroaster. The Manichees settled the difficulty better than our Deists by declaring the existence of a good God and a bad one; and appealed to the daily strife between virtue and vice, nay, life and death, in witness of their simple creed. Thanks to the gospel, a nobler theology is our Christian heritage, whereby we are persuaded that good will triumph at the last, and by which we are taught humility withal to own that God’s ways in so permitting and overworking evil are beyond man’s comprehension. And a better scepticism remains for us than that of the Theist, or Agnostic either; a disbelief more vehement that here can be the end, since in this life we experience in no sense the rewards of just and unjust to the full.<p><span class= "note">[14] Specially see J. S. Mill’s “Three Essays on Religion.” <span class= "ital">Nature, </span>p. 38.</span><p><span class= "bld">For God cannot be tempted with evil.</span>—We can see here a good instance of the excellence of the old Geneva Bible, “the first on several occasions to seize the exact meaning of a passage which all the preceding versions had missed.” Our present rendering follows the Genevan exactly, rejecting those of Wiclif. “God is not a tempter of yuell things”; Tyndale, “God tempteth not vnto evyll”; and Cranmer, “God cannot tempte vnto euyll.”<p><span class= "bld">Neither tempteth he any man.</span>—The trial comes of Him, <span class= "ital">i.e., </span>the Tempter is allowed; but so far, and no further. God Himself is “unversed of evils,” and no possibility of temptation remains with Him. Into the unseen splendour of His fulness no thought of wrong can enter; no foul thing wing its silent flight. It were blasphemy, perilously near that of the Pharisees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/12-22.htm" title="Then was brought to him one possessed with a devil, blind, and dumb: and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both spoke and saw.">Matthew 12:22-37</a>) to think God’s kingdom could be so divided against itself, that He, directly or indirectly, should seduce His subjects into the revolt of sin. No; if we have one golden clue by which we may feel our erring way out of the labyrinth of this lower world into the belief and trust in God our Father for the life to come, it is this: trials and temptations are permitted to strengthen us—if we will—for His mightier service. And, as compulsory homage would be worthless to the loving Lord of all, voluntary must be found instead, and proved and perfected. Herein is the Christian conflict, and the secret of God’s ways with man.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">James 1:13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let no man say, when he is tempted — </span>To commit sin, in whatever way it may be; <span class="ital">I am tempted of God </span>— God has laid this temptation in my way; <span class="ital">for God cannot be tempted with evil </span>— It cannot appear desirable, or otherwise than detestable, in God’s eyes; nor can he be inclined to it in any degree, through any external object, or any internal motion; <span class="ital">neither tempteth he any man </span>— He does not persuade or incline, much less constrain any one to sin by any means whatever. The word <span class="greekheb">πειραζειν</span>, <span class="ital">to tempt, </span>as we have seen, often signifies <span class="ital">“to try, </span>in order to discover the disposition of a person, or to improve his virtue, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">James 1:12</a>.

In the same sense the Israelites are said to have <span class="ital">tempted </span>or proved God. They put his power and goodness to the trial, by entertaining doubts concerning them. Here, <span class="ital">to tempt, </span>signifies to <span class="ital">solicit </span>one to sin, and actually to seduce him into sin, which is the effect of temptation or solicitation.

Afflictions cannot make us miserable, if it be not our own fault. The tried Christian shall be a crowned one. The crown of life is promised to all who have the love of God reigning in their hearts. Every soul that truly loves God, shall have its trials in this world fully recompensed in that world above, where love is made perfect. The commands of God, and the dealings of his providence, try men's hearts, and show the dispositions which prevail in them. But nothing sinful in the heart or conduct can be ascribed to God. He is not the author of the dross, though his fiery trial exposes it. Those who lay the blame of sin, either upon their constitution, or upon their condition in the world, or pretend they cannot keep from sinning, wrong God as if he were the author of sin. Afflictions, as sent by God, are designed to draw out our graces, but not our corruptions. The origin of evil and temptation is in our own hearts. Stop the beginnings of sin, or all the evils that follow must be wholly charged upon us. God has no pleasure in the death of men, as he has no hand in their sin; but both sin and misery are owing to themselves. As the sun is the same in nature and influences, though the earth and clouds, often coming between, make it seem to us to vary, so God is unchangeable, and our changes and shadows are not from any changes or alterations in him. What the sun is in nature, God is in grace, providence, and glory; and infinitely more. As every good gift is from God, so particularly our being born again, and all its holy, happy consequences come from him. A true Christian becomes as different a person from what he was before the renewing influences of Divine grace, as if he were formed over again. We should devote all our faculties to God's service, that we may be a kind of first-fruits of his creatures.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God - See the remarks on the previous verse. The apostle here seems to have had his eye on whatever there was in trial of any kind to induce us to commit sin - whether by complaining, by murmuring, by apostacy, or by yielding to sin. So far as that was concerned, he said that no one should charge it on God. He did nothing in any way with a view to induce men to do evil. That was only an incidental thing in the trial, and was no part of the divine purpose or design. The apostle felt evidently that there was great danger, from the general manner in which the word "temptation" was used, and from the perverse tendency of the heart, that it would be charged on God that he so arranged these trials, and so influenced the mind, as to present inducements to sin. Against this, it was proper that an inspired apostle should bear his solemn testimony; so to guard the whole subject as to show that whatever there was in any form of trial that could be regarded as an inducement or allurement to sin, is not the thing which he contemplated in the arrangement, and does not proceed from him. It has its origin in other causes; and if there was nothing in the corrupt human mind itself leading to sin, there would be nothing in the divine arrangement that would produce it.<p>For God cannot be tempted with evil - Margin, "evils." The sense is the same. The object seems to be to show that, in regard to the whole matter of temptation, it does not pertain to God. Nothing can be presented to his mind as an inducement to do wrong, and as little can he present anything to the mind of man to induce him to sin. Temptation is a subject which does not pertain to him. He stands aloof from it altogether. In regard to the particular statement here, that "God cannot be tempted with evil," or to do evil, there can be no doubt of its truth, and it furnishes the highest security for the welfare of the universe. There is nothing in him that has a tendency to wrong; there can be nothing presented from without to induce him to do wrong:<p>(1) There is no evil passion to be gratified, as there is in men;<p>(2) There is no want of power, so that an allurement could be presented to seek what he has not;<p>(3) There is no want of wealth, for he has infinite resources, and all that there is or can be is his <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/50-10.htm">Psalm 50:10-11</a>;<p>(4) There is no want of happiness, that he should seek happiness in sources which are not now in his possession. Nothing, therefore, could be presented to the divine mind as an inducement to do evil.<p>Neither tempteth he any man - That is, he places nothing before any human being with a view to induce him to do wrong. This is one of the most positive and unambiguous of all the declarations in the Bible, and one of the most important. It may be added, that it is one which stands in opposition to as many feelings of the human heart as perhaps any other one. We are perpetually thinking - the heart suggests it constantly - that God does place before us inducements to evil, with a view to lead us to sin. This is done in many ways:<p>(a) People take such views of his decrees as if the doctrine implied that he meant that we should sin, and that it could not be otherwise than that we should sin.<p>(b) It is felt that all things are under his control, and that he has made his arrangements with a design that men should do as they actually do.<p>(c) It is said that he has created us with just such dispositions as we actually have, and knowing that we would sin.<p>(d) It is said that, by the arrangements of his Providence, he actually places inducements before us to sin, knowing that the effect will be that we will fall into sin, when we might easily have prevented it.<p>(e) It is said that he suffers some to tempt others, when he might easily prevent it if he chose, and that this is the same as tempting them himself.<p>Now, in regard to these things, there may be much which we cannot explain, and much which often troubles the heart even of the good; yet the passage before us is explicit on one point, and all these things must be held in consistency with that - that God does not place inducements before us with a view that we should sin, or in order to lead us into sin. None of his decrees, or his arrangements, or his desires, are based on that, but all have some other purpose and end. The real force of temptation is to be traced to some other source - to ourselves, and not to God.

Heretofore the "temptation" meant was that of probation by afflictions. Let no one fancy that God lays upon him an inevitable necessity of sinning.

Therefore do not sink under the pressure of evils (1Co 10:13).<p>of God&#8212;by agency proceeding from God.

God is said in Ge 22:1 to have "tempted Abraham"; but there the tempting meant is that of trying or proving, not that of seducement. Alford translates according to the ordinary sense of the Greek, "God is unversed in evil." But as this gives a less likely sense, English Version probably gives the true sense; for ecclesiastical Greek often uses words in new senses, as the exigencies of the new truths to be taught required.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let no man say; </span> neither with his mouth, nor so much as in his heart, blasphemously cast the blame of his sins upon God, to clear himself. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When he is tempted; </span> so stirred up to sin as to be drawn to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I am tempted of God; </span> either solicited by God to sin, or enforced to it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">For God cannot be tempted with evil; </span> cannot be drawn aside to any thing that is unrighteous, by any motion from within, or impression from without. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Neither tempteth he any man; </span> doth no way seduce or enforce to sin, so as to be justly chargeable as the author of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Objection.</span> God is said to be tempted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/17-2.htm" title="Why the people did chide with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink.

Here the apostle uses the word "tempted", in another sense than he did before. Before he speaks of temptations, as matter of joy and boasting, here of temptations, which are criminal, and issue in shame and death; the temptations he before makes mention of, being patiently endured, denominate men happy, but here such are designed, which are to be deprecated, and watched against; before he treats of temptations, which were the means of trying and exercising grace, and of purging away the dross of sin and corruption, but here of temptations to sin, and which are in themselves sinful; before he discourses of temptations in which God was concerned; but here of temptations which he removes from him, and denies of him, as being unworthy of him: wherefore, when any man is tempted to sin, whether when under adversity, or in prosperity, let him not say, <p>I am tempted of God; for God is holy, and without iniquity, nor does he delight in sin, but hates and abhors it; nor can he commit it, it being contrary to his nature, and the perfections of it; whereas no one can tempt another to sin, unless he is sinful himself, and delights in sin, and in those that commit it, nor without committing it himself; and yet sinful men are apt to charge God with their sins, and temptations to them, in imitation of their first parent, Adam, when fallen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-12.htm">Genesis 3:12</a> who, to excuse himself, lays the blame upon the woman, and ultimately upon God, who gave her to him; and suggests, that if it had not been for the woman, he should not have ate of the forbidden fruit, nor should he have had any temptation to it, had not God given him the woman to be with him, and therefore it was his fault; and in this sad manner do his sons and daughters reason, who, when, through affliction, they murmur against God, distrust his providence, or forsake his ways, say, if he had not laid his hand upon them, or suffered such afflictions to befall them, they had not been guilty of such sin: he himself is the occasion of them; but let no man talk at this wicked rate, <p>for God cannot be tempted with evil; or "evils", He was tempted by the Israelites at Massah and Meribah, from which those places had their names, who by their murmuring, distrust and unbelief, proved and tried his patience and his power; and so he may be, and has been tempted by others in a like way; he may be tempted by evil men, and with evil things, but he cannot be tempted "to evil", as the Ethiopic version renders it; he is proof against all such temptations: he cannot be tempted by anything in himself, who is pure and holy, or by any creature or thing without him, to do any sinful action: <p>neither tempteth he any man; that is, to sin; he tempted Abraham, to try his faith, love, and obedience to him; he tempted the Israelites in the wilderness, to try them and humble them, and prove what was in their hearts; and he tempted Job, and tried his faith and patience; and so he tempts and tries all his righteous ones, by afflictions, more or less: but he never tempts or solicits them to sin; temptations to sin come from another quarter, as follows. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{11}</span> Let no man say when he is <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> tempted, I am tempted of God: <span class="cverse3">{12}</span> for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:</span><p>(11) The third part of this epistle, in which he descends from outward temptations, that is, from afflictions by which God tries us: to inward, that is, to those lusts by which we are stirred up to do evil.

Pott: qui tentatione vincitur, ad peccandum vincitur; Theile: agit Jacobus de turpi tentatione per tristem (tentationem); so also Olshausen, Schneckenburger, Kern, and others. This connection is denied by others; thus Calvin says: de alio tentationes genere disserit; and Wiesinger in the strongest manner: “this appears as the design of the apostle: to distinguish as much as possible those <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοῦς</span> and this <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΙΡΆΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, to place the latter as totally different from the former.” But the close connection with the preceding constrains us to the opinion that James has considered both in reference to each other, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΙΡΑΣΜΟΊ</span></span></span> occasioning the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΙΡΆΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> which takes place when <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΠΙΘΥΜΊΑ</span></span></span> is excited by it.[64] It is arbitrary to take the verb <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span> in the clause: <span class="greekheb">μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος</span>, in another sense than in the following clause: <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι</span>, as Hottinger asserts: hic verbum <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span> bis dicitur sensu diversi; priori loco simpliciter: adversa pati; posteriori: malis sollicitari ad defectionem (similarly Grotius, Semler; also Lange); for, according to this interpretation, the excuse: <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., would not correspond to the supposition contained in <span class="greekheb">μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος</span>.

James does not with these words refer to any particular doctrine of religion and philosophy, perhaps to the doctrine of the Pharisees and Essenes on <span class="greekheb">εἱμαρμένη</span> (Bull, Ittig, Schneckenburger, and others), or the doctrine of Simon Magus (Calovius), but only considers generally the peculiar bias of the natural man to charge God somehow with the blame of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΕΙΡΆΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span>, recognisable in the answer of Adam to the question of God.[66]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>James grounds the rejection of the idea contained in <span class="greekheb">μηδεὶς</span> … <span class="greekheb">λεγέτω</span> that the <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span>, proceeds from God, by a sentence comprising two members: <span class="greekheb">ὁ γὰρ Θεὸς</span> … <span class="greekheb">οὐδένα</span>. The word <span class="greekheb">ἀπείραστος</span>, an <span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγ</span>. in the N. T., has in classical Greek—in which, however, the form <span class="greekheb">ἀπείρατος</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἀπείρητος</span>) almost always occurs—either the passive meaning <span class="ital">untempted</span>, that is, what is not tempted or proved, or the active meaning: he who has made no trial, equivalent to <span class="ital">inexperienced.</span> Some expositors take the word in the second meaning; thus Schulthess: in Deum nulla malorum experentia; de Wette, Brückner, and others.[67] But, on account of the close connection with <span class="greekheb">πειράζειν</span>, the word has here, as most expositors assume, an ethical meaning. Yet it is incorrect to explain it actively, with Luther (God is not a tempter to evil; Vulgate: intentator), because this clause would then be tautological with the following. It is rather to be taken passively: <span class="ital">untempted of evil</span>, by which the idea passes from <span class="ital">tentatus</span> to that of <span class="ital">tentabilis;</span> Winer, p. 175 [E. T. 242, 243]. By the Church Fathers God is often named simply <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἀπείραστος</span>; so Ignat. <span class="ital">ad Philipp.:</span> <span class="greekheb">τί πειράζεις τὸν ἀπείραστον</span>; Photius, <span class="ital">contra Manich.</span> iv. p. 225: <span class="greekheb">πειράζειν ἐπιχειρήσασι τὸν ἀπείραστον</span>. By this predicate the holiness of God, which is raised above all temptation to evil, is indicated, and is the motive likewise to the following thought.[68]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κακῶν</span> is not masculine, but neuter; not <span class="ital">misery</span> (Oecumenius), but <span class="ital">evil.</span>[69]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πειράζει δὲ αὐτὸς οὐδένα</span>] expresses the consequence of the preceding and the pointed contrast to <span class="greekheb">ἀπὸ Θεοῦ πειράζομαι</span>. <span class="greekheb">πειράζει</span> is placed first for the sake of emphasis. By <span class="greekheb">αὐτός</span>, which most interpreters pass over, is brought forward not God’s action in contrast to “being tempted” (Theile: ipse quoque non tentat idem ille Deus, qui tentari nequit; Wiesinger: “He, self-active;” so also Lange), but shows that the <span class="greekheb">πειράζειν</span> indeed takes place, but from another cause (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἴδια ἐπιθυμία</span>) than from God. The meaning of the whole verse is as follows: Let no man, when he is tempted (inwardly enticed) to evil, say, From God I am tempted: for God suffers no temptation; but (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>) as to the temptation, <span class="ital">He</span> (God) tempteth no man: but every man is tempted, etc.[70] As regards the apparent contradiction of this with other passages of the Holy Scriptures, where the sins of men are referred to God as their reason (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-1.htm" title="And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt Abraham, and said to him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here I am.">Genesis 22:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/8-2.htm" title="And you shall remember all the way which the LORD your God led you these forty years in the wilderness, to humble you, and to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or no.">Deuteronomy 8:2</a>, etc.), Calvin correctly remarks: Quum Scriptura excoecationem vel obdurationem cordis tribuit Deo, neque illi initium assignat, neque facit mali auctorem, ut culpam sustinere debeat. In his autem duobus solum Jacobus insistit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[63] When Lange meets this with the question: “How could any one endure the temptation without having first been tempted?” he only shows that he does not understand the explanation here given.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[64] It is to be observed that James designates the trials, on which he thinks in <span class="greekheb">ὅταν πειρασμοῖς περιπίσητι</span>, ver. 3, as <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοί</span>. It may be said that they are not this in themselves, but only in so far as the Christian is yet a sinner, and can thus be enticed by them into sin; when this happens, then the <span class="greekheb">πειράζεσθαι</span>, of which James here speaks, takes place. Stier: “That there is a necessity for our all being tested and approved through, trial, springs from our sin; the tempting element in our trial, the evil in it, springs therefore from that and not from God.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[65] He might find a justification of this in the fact that <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοί</span> actually spring from God. See Meyer on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>, and on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>. Lange introduces inappropriate matter, maintaining in favour of the concrete relations supposed by him, that the Jews and Judaizing Christians with this word would justify their fanaticism against the Gentiles, particularly their separation from the Gentile Christians, as an affair of God (for His glory)!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[66] Many expressions in Greek authors show how natural this is to man; comp. <span class="ital">Il.</span> <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. 86: <span class="greekheb">ἰγώ δʼ οὐκ αἴτιός εἰμι ἀλλὰ Ζεύς</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ μοῖρα</span>; Plaut. <span class="ital">Aulul.</span> iv. 10. 7: Deus impulsor mihi fuit; Terent. <span class="ital">Eunuch.</span> v. 2. 86: Quid, si hoc voluit quispiam Deus?—Such an excuse suggested itself to the Jews the more as it appeared justified by the language of the O. T. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-16.htm" title="You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.">Exodus 20:16</a>. On the contrary, Philo (<span class="ital">Quod. deter. pot.</span> 177 D) remarks: <span class="greekheb">οὐ ὡς ἔνιοι τῶν ἀσεβῶν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸν Θεὸν αἴτιον τῶν κακῶν φῆσι Μωϋσῆς</span>. Still more fully in Schneckenburger.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[67] Buttmann, p. 148 [E. T. 170], contests this meaning, which rather belongs to the word <span class="greekheb">ἄπειρος</span>. But passages, as Hom. <span class="ital">Il.</span> ad Ven. v. 133: <span class="greekheb">ἀδμήτην μʼ ἀγάγων καὶ ἀπειρήτην φιλότητος</span>; Theognis, 772: <span class="greekheb">πολλοὶ ἀπείρητοι δόξαν ἔχουσʼ ἀγαθῶν</span>, show that <span class="greekheb">ἀπείρατος</span> actually has that meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[68] Lange maintains, in reference to the interpretation given above, that in this commentary <span class="greekheb">ἀπείρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κακ</span>. is explained as equivalent to “God has no experience of evil,” and that it is said that the passive construction: “not tempted,” “not temptable,” is against grammatical usage and the connection! In a very strange manner he thinks it is here designed to strengthen the warning: <span class="ital">Let no man say;</span> for this <span class="ital">saying</span>, like all fanaticism, was a tempting God, and therefore vain and impious, because God does not suffer Himself to be tempted.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[69] Inapposite uniting of various explanations by Theile and Morus: <span class="greekheb">ἀπείρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κακ</span>. dicitur, partim quoniam nullae miseriae possunt evenire Deo, partim quoniam per eas non potest inclinari ad peccandum, ad cupiditatem aliquam exercendam; Deus igitur est expers miseriae omnis atque etiam peccati vel pravae cupiditatis, et quia est, neque tentatur a malis ipse, neque alium tentat.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[70] The passage in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/15-11.htm" title="Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth....">Sir 15:11-12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/15-20.htm" title="He hath commanded no man to do wickedly, neither hath he given any man licence to sin.">Sir 15:20</a>, is especially to be compared: <span class="greekheb">μὴ εἴπῃς ὅτι διὰ κύριον ἀπέστην</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ εἴπῃς ὅτι αὐτός με ἐπλάνησεν</span>. <span class="greekheb">Οὐκ ἐνετείλατο οὐδενὶ ἀσεβεῖν καὶ οὐκ ἔδωκεν ἄνεσιν οὐδενὶ ἁμαρτάνειν</span>.

On this view <span class="greekheb">πειραζόμενος</span> refers to temptation of a special kind, <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-28.htm" title="But I say to you, That whoever looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.">Matthew 5:28</a>, <span class="greekheb">πᾶς ὁ βλέπων γυναῖκα πρὸς τὸ ἐπιθυμῆσαι</span> …; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-11.htm" title="Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;">1 Peter 2:11</a>, <span class="greekheb">Ἀγαπητοί</span>, <span class="greekheb">παρακαλῶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι τῶν σαρκικῶν ἐπιθυμιῶν αἵτινες στρατεύονται κατὰ τῆς ψυχῆς</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/4-2.htm" title="You lust, and have not: you kill, and desire to have, and cannot obtain: you fight and war, yet you have not, because you ask not....">Jam 4:2-3</a> … <span class="greekheb">εἰς τὸ μηκέτι ἀνθρώπων ἐπιθυμίαις ἀλλὰ θελήματι Θεοῦ</span>.…—<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> the parallel use of <span class="greekheb">כי</span> in Hebrew.—<span class="greekheb">ἀπείραστός ἐστι κακῶν</span>: “Untemptable of evil”; see Mayor’s very interesting note on <span class="greekheb">ἀπείραστος</span>; the word does not occur elsewhere in N.T., nor in the Septuagint. If the interpretation of this passage given above be correct, the meaning here would seem to be that it is inconceivable that the idea should come into the mind of God to tempt men to lust; the “untemptableness” has perhaps a two-fold application: God cannot be tempted to do evil Himself, nor can He be tempted with the wish to tempt men. The word in its essence is really an insistence upon one of the fundamental beliefs concerning the Jewish doctrine of God, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, His attribute of Holiness and ethical purity; the teaching of many centuries is summed up in the third of the “Thirteen Principles” of Maimonides: “I believe with perfect faith that the Creator, blessed be His name, is not a body, and that He is free from all the accidents of matter, and that He has not any form whatsoever”. The Peshiṭtâ rendering of this clause, from which one might have looked for something suggestive, is very disappointing and entirely loses the force of the Greek.—<span class="greekheb">πειράζει</span>, etc., see Introduction IV., § 1.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. <span class="ital">Let no man say when he is tempted</span>] The thought of trial as coming from outward circumstances, and forming part of man’s spiritual education, leads to a deeper inquiry as to its nature, and so passes on to the wider notion of temptation, which includes the allurements of desire as well as the trials of adversity, In both cases men found refuge from the reproof of conscience in a kind of fatalism. God had placed them in such and such circumstances; therefore, He was the author of the sin to which those circumstances had led. The excuse is one which presents itself to men’s minds at all times, but here also there is a special point of contact with the Son of Sirach: “Say not thou, it is through the Lord that I fell away” (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/15-11.htm" title="Say not thou, It is through the Lord that I fell away: for thou oughtest not to do the things that he hateth.">Sir 15:11</a>). It may be noted that the popular Pharisaism, which taught a doctrine of necessity (Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant</span>. xviii. 1. § 3; <span class="ital">Wars</span>, ii. 8. § 14) while speculatively maintaining also the freedom of man’s will, was likely to develope into this kind of practical fatalism.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">I am tempted of God</span>] The order of the Greek words is more emphatic, <span class="bld">It is from God that I am tempted</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for God cannot be tempted with evil</span>] The English “cannot be tempted” answers to a Greek verbal adjective, not used elsewhere in the New Testament or in the LXX. version of the Old, and not found in Classical Greek. Its meaning as used in later Greek writers, is simply “untried,” and so “unversed in,” and it has been maintained that it is so used here, but the context makes it almost certain that St James used it in the sense of “<span class="ital">untempted</span>.” At first it might seem as if this assertion did not meet the thought to which it appears to be answer, but the latent premiss of the reasoning seems to be that no one tempts to evil, who has not been first himself tempted by it. If men shrank from the blasphemy of affirming that of God, they ought to shrink also from the thought that He could ever tempt them to evil. He who was absolutely righteous, could not be the originator of sin. He <span class="ital">tries</span> men, but does not <span class="ital">tempt</span> them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">neither tempteth he any man</span>] Better, <span class="bld">and He</span> (the pronoun is emphatic) <span class="bld">tempteth no one</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm" title="Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempts he any man:">Jam 1:13</a>. <span class="greekheb">Μηδεὶς πειραζόμενος</span>, <span class="ital">no man, who is tempted</span>) Now there follows another section on the subject of temptations.
