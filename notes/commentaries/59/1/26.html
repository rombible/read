A Christian may have, or rather cannot help having, the feeling that he is a religious man; and so far well. But if such a one deceive his own heart, as confessedly he may, and give to those around him the proof of his self-delusion in not curbing his tongue, vain and useless is all his religious service. Just as some mistakenly suppose there can be a religion of hearing without acting, so others rest satisfied “in outward acts of worship, or exactness of ritual.” “But,” remarks Bishop Moberly on this passage, and his voice may win an audience where another’s would not, “if a man think himself a true worshipper because he conforms to outward services, while he lets his tongue loose in untruth or unkindness or other unseemliness, he deceives himself.” The first mark of true religion is gentleness of tongue, just as the contrary, blasphemy, is the most damning fault of all. Our Lord directly says, “By thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>). The text, however, is more a guide for self-examination than a stone to be cast at a neighbour; and “well is” it indeed for “him that hath not slipped with his tongue” (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/25-8.htm" title="Well is him that dwelleth with a wife of understanding, and that hath not slipped with his tongue, and that hath not served a man more unworthy than himself:">Ecclesiasticus 25:8</a>).<p>The Apostle returns to this subject, though from a different point of view, in James 3, which compare with the above. The best commentary on the whole is Bishop Butler’s Sermon, No. IV., “Upon the Government of the Tongue.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain....">James 1:26-27</a></span>. <span class="ital">If </span>&c. — Here the apostle shows more particularly who are the doers of the word; 1st, Negatively, in this verse: 2d, Positively, in the next verse. <span class="ital">If any man among you </span>— Who are professors of Christianity; <span class="ital">seem to be religious </span>— <span class="greekheb">Θρησκος</span>, <span class="ital">pious, </span>devout, or a worshipper of God: and if his conduct in other respects be irreprehensible, and he be exact in all the outward offices of religion, yet if he <span class="ital">bridleth not his tongue </span>— From tale-bearing, backbiting, evil-speaking, slandering; or from vain, foolish, ostentatious talking and jesting; or rash, bitter, passionate, malicious, revengeful expressions: this man only <span class="ital">deceiveth his own heart </span>— If he fancy he has any true religion at all; for his <span class="ital">religion is vain </span>— Is a mere empty profession, and neither is nor will be of any service to him. <span class="ital">Pure religion — </span>The word <span class="greekheb">θρησκεια</span>, here used, properly signifies <span class="ital">worship, </span>which branch of religion is put for the whole. In the epithets here given to it, <span class="ital">pure and undefiled, </span>Archbishop Tillotson thinks there is an allusion to the excellence of a precious stone, which consists much in its being <span class="greekheb">καθαρα και αμιαντος</span>, <span class="ital">clear, and without flaw, </span>or <span class="ital">cloud. </span>And surely, says Doddridge, no gem is so precious or ornamental as the lovely temper here described. Here then the apostle describes the religion which Isaiah , 1 st, True and genuine, in opposition to that which is false and mistaken: 2d, Sincere and solid, in opposition to that which is feigned and pretended: 3d, Pure and holy, in opposition to that which is mixed with the inventions and superstitions of men, and defiled by erroneous principles and vicious practices. But what is this religion? In what does it consist? The apostle informs us: it consists not in speculations or notions, however just and orthodox. Not in forms or modes of worship, however Scriptural and necessary to be observed. Not in the warmth of affection, or ardour of zeal, &c., during worship. But, in consequence of repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, of justification by faith, and regeneration by the influence of the Divine Spirit, it consists in the possession and exercise of that love to God and all mankind, which is the source of the various branches of practical religion, of mercy as well as justice toward men, and of holiness toward God. True <span class="ital">religion before God </span>— Before his penetrating eyes; <span class="ital">even the Father </span>— Whose intelligent and immortal offspring we all are; <span class="ital">is this, to visit — </span>With counsel, comfort, and relief; <span class="ital">the fatherless and widows </span>— Those who need it most; <span class="ital">in their affliction</span> — In their most helpless and hopeless state; <span class="ital">and to keep himself unspotted from the world </span>— From the maxims, tempers, habits, and customs of it. But this cannot be done till we have given our hearts to God, and love our neighbour as ourselves. That this is true or pure religion, or the proper effect and evidence thereof, the reader will not question, if he recollects, 1st, That religion consists principally in faith working by love to God and man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-6.htm" title="For in Jesus Christ neither circumcision avails any thing, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.">Galatians 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-1.htm" title="Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.">1 Corinthians 13:1</a>, &c.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-8.htm" title="(For his disciples were gone away to the city to buy meat.)">John 4:8</a>. 2d, That the most eminent and important fruit of faith, and of the love of our neighbour, is not saying, <span class="ital">Be thou warmed, </span>(<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">James 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-17.htm" title="Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this world.">1 John 4:17</a>,) but visiting, comforting, and relieving the needy and distressed. 3d, That the most important fruit of faith in, and love to, God, is purity of intention and affection, or the being dead to, and unspotted by, the world. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:26,27 When men take more pains to seem religious than really to be so, it is a sign their religion is in vain. The not bridling the tongue, readiness to speak of the faults of others, or to lessen their wisdom and piety, are signs of a vain religion. The man who has a slandering tongue, cannot have a truly humble, gracious heart. False religious may be known by their impurity and uncharitableness. True religion teaches us to do every thing as in the presence of God. An unspotted life must go with unfeigned love and charity. Our true religion is equal to the measure in which these things have place in our hearts and conduct. And let us remember, that nothing avails in Christ Jesus, but faith that worketh by love, purifies the heart, subdues carnal lusts, and obeys God's commands.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any man among you seem to be religious - Pious, or devout. That is, if he does not restrain his tongue, his other evidences of religion are worthless. A man may undoubtedly have many things in his character which seem to be evidences of the existence of religion in his heart, and yet there may be some one thing that shall show that all those evidences are false. Religion is designed to produce an effect on our whole conduct; and if there is any one thing in reference to which it does not bring us under its control, that one thing may show that all other appearances of piety are worthless.<p>And bridleth not his tongue - Restrains or curbs it not, as a horse is restrained with a bridle. There may have been some reason why the apostle referred to this particular sin which is now unknown to us; or he may perhaps have intended to select this as a specimen to illustrate this idea, that if there is any one evil propensity which religion does not control, or if there is any one thing in respect to which its influence is not felt, whatever other evidences of piety there may be, this will demonstrate that all those appearances of religion are vain. For religion is designed to bring the whole man under control, and to subdue every faculty of the body and mind to its demands. If the tongue is not restrained, or if there is any unsubdued propensity to sin whatever, it proves that there is no true religion.<p>But deceiveth his own heart - Implying that he does deceive his heart by supposing that any evidence can prove that he is under the influence of religion if his tongue is unrestrained. Whatever love, or zeal, or orthodoxy, or gift in preaching or in prayer he may have, this one evil propensity will neutralize it all, and show that there is no true religion at heart.<p>This man's religion is vain - As all religion must be which does not control all the faculties of the body and the mind. The truths, then, which are taught in this verse are:<p>(1) That there may be evidences of piety which seem to be very plausible or clear, but which in themselves do not prove that there is any true religion. There may be much zeal, as in the case of the Pharisees; there may be much apparent love of Christians, or much outward benevolence; there may be an uncommon gift in prayer; there may be much self-denial, as among those who withdraw from the world in monasteries or nunneries; or there may have been deep conviction for sin, and much joy at the time of the supposed conversion, and still there be no true religion. Each and all of these things may exist in the heart where there is no true religion.<p>(2) a single unsubdued sinful propensity neutralizes all these things, and shows that there is no true religion. If the tongue is not subdued; if any sin is indulged, it will show that the seat of the evil has not been reached, and that the soul, as such, has never been brought into subjection to the law of God. For the very essence of all the sin that there was in the soul may have been concentrated on that one propensity. Everything else which may be manifested may be accounted for on the supposition that there is no religion; this cannot be accounted for on the supposition that there is any. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>26, 27. An example of doing work.<p>religious &#8230; religion&#8212;The Greek expresses the external service or exercise of religion, "godliness" being the internal soul of it. "If any man think himself to be (so the Greek) religious, that is, observant of the offices of religion, let him know these consist not so much in outward observances, as in such acts of mercy and humble piety (Mic 6:7, 8) as visiting the fatherless, &c., and keeping one's self unspotted from the world" (Mt 23:23). James does not mean that these offices are the great essentials, or sum total of religion; but that, whereas the law service was merely ceremonial, the very services of the Gospel consist in acts of mercy and holiness, and it has light for its garment, its very robe being righteousness [Trench]. The Greek word is only found in Ac 26:5, "after the straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee." Col 2:18, "worshipping of angels."<p>bridleth not &#8230; tongue&#8212;Discretion in speech is better than fluency of speech (compare Jas 3:2, 3). Compare Ps 39:1. God alone can enable us to do so. James, in treating of the law, naturally notices this sin. For they who are free from grosser sins, and even bear the outward show of sanctity, will often exalt themselves by detracting others under the pretense of zeal, while their real motive is love of evil-speaking [Calvin].<p>heart&#8212;It and the tongue act and react on one another.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">If any man among you seem to be religious; </span> seems to others, or rather to himself; thinks himself religious, because cause of his hearing and outward worship: thus the word rendered <span class="ital">seems</span> is often taken, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-18.htm" title="Let no man deceive himself.

The following words: <span class="greekheb">μὴ χαλιναγωγῶν τὴν γλῶσσαν αὑτοῦ</span>, indicate in what the <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> of the readers consisted. It is incorrect, with Rosenmüller, Theile, and others, to supply <span class="ital">exempli causa</span>, and, as most interpreters do, to resolve the participle by <span class="ital">although;</span> James will blame those who reckon zeal in speaking as a sign of <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span>.[107] The verb <span class="greekheb">χαλιναγωγεῖν</span>, in the N.

Pott correctly: sc. eo quod nimian docendi licentiam et linguae extemperantiam pro vera <span class="greekheb">θρησκείᾳ</span> habet. The clause belongs not to the apodosis (Schneckenburger), but, as in form so in meaning, is closely connected with the preceding participle. The expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπατᾷν καρδίαν αὑτοῦ</span> corresponds to <span class="greekheb">παραλογίζεσθαι ἑαυτόν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">Jam 1:22</a>), but is a stronger form, although it does not indicate only the consequence resulting from zeal (Lange); comp. <span class="ital">Test.

Erasmus incorrectly explains <span class="greekheb">ἀπατᾷν</span> by <span class="ital">sinere</span> aberrare. The apodosis, which emphatically begins with <span class="greekheb">τούτου</span>, declares that such a <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> is not only without fruit (Baumgarten), but without actual contents, is thus foolish and vain, corresponding to the thought: <span class="greekheb">ὀργὴ δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ οὐ</span> (<span class="greekheb">κατ</span>)<span class="greekheb">εργάζεται</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[106] Some Catholic interpreters, Salmero, Paes, and others, refer the expression to the observance of the so-called <span class="ital">consilia Christi</span>, particularly to voluntary circumcision for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[107] Rauch also thinks that “the participles must certainly be resolved by <span class="ital">although;</span>” but by this explanation all indication is wanting of that on which those blamed by James rest <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span>; also what follows (ver. 27), where the nature of true <span class="greekheb">θρησκεία</span> is given, forms no appropriate antithesis to this verse. Brückner explains it: “whosoever seeks worship in striving by teaching to work on others;” here the participle is correctly resolved, but the full meaning is not given to the verb.

Although these verses are organically connected with the preceding section, they are self-contained, and deal with another aspect of religion. While the earlier verses, 19<span class="ital">b</span>–25, emphasise the need of doing as well as hearing, these speak of self-control in the matter of the tongue.

Comp. the cognate word rendered “<span class="ital">worship</span> of angels” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm" title=" Let no man beguile you of your reward in a voluntary humility and worshipping of angels, intruding into those things which he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind,">Colossians 2:18</a>. It is not easy to find an appropriate English adjective for it. “Religious” in its modern sense is too wide, in its old pre-Reformation sense, as meaning one who belonged to a monastic order, too narrow. That sense can hardly be said to have attached to it at the time of the Authorised Version, as the term is used both in the Homilies (e. g. “Christ and his <span class="ital">religion</span>,” Hom. on Holy Scripture) and Bacon’s Essays (<span class="ital">Of Unity in Religion</span>) quite in its modern sense for a whole system of faith and practice. “Devout,” “pious,” “reverent,” suggest themselves, but all fail to express what the Greek beyond question expresses. “Worshipper” would perhaps be the nearest equivalent. “Ritualist,” which answers most closely to the strict meaning, has unfortunately acquired a conventional and party meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and bridleth not his tongue</span>] The image was a sufficiently common one in the Greek poets and philosophers. St James returns to it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole body....">James 3:2-3</a>. See note there.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">deceiveth his own heart</span>] Here the word is the more common one, as distinguished from that which had been used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-22.htm" title="But be you doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own selves.">James 1:22</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a>. <span class="greekheb">Εἴ τις</span>, <span class="ital">if any man</span>) He now adds examples of <span class="ital">doing the work</span>.—<span class="greekheb">θρῆσκος</span>, <span class="ital">religious</span>) A worshipper of God, in private and in public. Hesychius, <span class="greekheb">θρῆσκος</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἑτερόδοξος</span>, <span class="greekheb">εὐγενής</span>: that is, one who has more knowledge than others, and is endued with a nobler mind. The commentary of Œcumenius agrees with this; for with him <span class="greekheb">θρῆσκος</span> is one who knows the secret things of the law, and diligently observes them.[16]—<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΧΑΛΙΝΑΓΩΓῶΝ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">not bridling</span>) A most appropriate metaphor.

The one leads and follows the other. The tongue has its faculty of speech, and the heart its affections;[17] <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[16] <span class="greekheb">γνώστης τῶν ἐν τῷ νόμῳ ἀποῤῥήτων καὶ ἀκριβὴς φύλαξ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[17] These two things are joined together in a similar way, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ecclesiastes/5-1.htm" title="Keep your foot when you go to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they consider not that they do evil....">Ecclesiastes 5:1-2</a> : “Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty to utter anything before God.” And that Book of Solomon agrees with this Epistle of James in this respect especially, that they both urge moderation in all things. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-34.htm" title="O generation of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.">Matthew 12:34</a>, “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.” The tongue sins in reproaches, perjuries, lying, jesting, false promises, murmuring, etc.—V. g.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/1.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seem</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1fd6;</span>); seems to himself rather than to others; translate, with R.V., <span class="accented">thinketh himself to be.</span> Vulgate, <span class="accented">Si quis Putat se esse. <span class="cmt_word"></span>Religious</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>). It is difficult to find an English word which exactly answers to the Greek. The noun <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> refers properly to the <span class="accented">external rites</span> of religion, and so gets to signify an over-scrupulous devotion to external forms (Lightfoot on <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-18.htm">Colossians 2:18</a>); almost "ritualism." It is the ceremonial service of religion, the external forms, a body of which <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> is the informing soul. Thus the <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1fc6;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> (the word apparently only occurs here in the whole range of Greek literature) is the diligent performer of Divine offices, of the <span class="accented">outward</span> service of God, but not necessarily anything more. This depreciatory sense of <span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x20;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;</span> well seen in a passage of Philo ('Quod Det. Pot.

The thought is developed more fully afterwards (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>, etc., and for the word, cf.

Herodotus (ii., 37) uses it of various observances practised by the Egyptian priests, such as wearing linen, circumcision, shaving, etc. The derivation is uncertain. &#x398;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, to mutter forms of prayer, has been suggested, as the followers of Wycliffe were called Lollards, from the old Dutch lullen or lollen, to sing. Hence the adjective here refers to a zealous and diligent performance of religious services.<p>Bridleth (&#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>Used by James only. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm">James 3:2</a>. Lit., to guide with a bridle.
