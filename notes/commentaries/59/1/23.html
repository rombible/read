Here the word of God is represented as a mirror, in which, if a man will look with attention and care, he will see the face of his soul, and discover in what state he is, and what character he bears in the sight of God. It will manifest to him those principles and practices, those thoughts and imaginations, those affections, intentions, dispositions, words, and actions, which are contrary to truth and grace, to wisdom, piety, and virtue. But frequently those who discover all this through the word heard or read, go away, and so occupy themselves in secular affairs, as immediately to forget what manner of persons they were, and continue the same in their temper and conduct as before.

Mere hearers are self-deceivers; and self-deceit will be found the worst deceit at last. If we flatter ourselves, it is our own fault; the truth, as it is in Jesus, flatters no man. Let the word of truth be carefully attended to, and it will set before us the corruption of our nature, the disorders of our hearts and lives; and it will tell us plainly what we are. Our sins are the spots the law discovers: Christ's blood is the laver the gospel shows. But in vain do we hear God's word, and look into the gospel glass, if we go away, and forget our spots, instead of washing them off; and forget our remedy, instead of applying to it. This is the case with those who do not hear the word as they ought. In hearing the word, we look into it for counsel and direction, and when we study it, it turns to our spiritual life. Those who keep in the law and word of God, are, and shall be, blessed in all their ways. His gracious recompence hereafter, would be connected with his present peace and comfort. Every part of Divine revelation has its use, in bringing the sinner to Christ for salvation, and in directing and encouraging him to walk at liberty, by the Spirit of adoption, according to the holy commands of God. And mark the distinctness, it is not for his deeds, that any man is blessed, but in his deed. It is not talking, but walking, that will bring us to heaven. Christ will become more precious to the believer's soul, which by his grace will become more fitted for the inheritance of the saints in light.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if any be ... - The ground of the comparison in these verses is obvious. The apostle refers to what all persons experience, the fact that we do not retain a distinct impression of ourselves after we have looked in a mirror. While actually looking in the mirror, we see all our features, and can trace them distinctly; when we turn away, the image and the impression both vanish. When looking in the mirror, we can see all the defects and blemishes of our person; if there is a scar, a deformity, a feature of ugliness, it is distinctly before the mind; but when we turn away, that is "out of sight and out of mind." When unseen it gives no uneasiness, and, even if capable of correction, we take no pains to remove it. So when we hear the word of God. It is like a mirror held up before us. In the perfect precepts of the law, and the perfect requirements of the gospel, we see our own short-comings and defects, and perhaps think that we will correct them. But we turn away immediately, and forget it all. If, however, we were doers of the word," we should endeavor to remove all those defects and blemishes in our moral character, and to bring our whole souls into conformity with what the law and the gospel require. The phrase "natural face" (Greek: face of birth), means, the face or appearance which we have in virtue of our natural birth. The word glass here means mirror. Glass was not commonly used for mirrors among the ancients, but they were made of polished plates of metal. See the <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/37-18.htm">Job 37:18</a> note.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-24.htm" title="For he beholds himself, and goes his way, and straightway forgets what manner of man he was.">Jam 1:24</a>, “forgetteth what manner of man he was” makes it improbable that the reference is to the “natural face,” because a man would probably have some idea as to what his features were like. If <span class="greekheb">πρόσωπον</span> is here used in the sense of “personality” (as in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/4-22.htm" title="Accept no person against thy soul, and let not the reverence of any man cause thee to fall.">Sir 4:22</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/4-27.htm" title="Make not thyself an underling to a foolish man; neither accept the person of the mighty.">Sir 4:27</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/7-6.htm" title="Seek not to be judge, being not able to take away iniquity; lest at any time thou fear the person of the mighty, an stumblingblock in the way of thy uprightness.">Sir 7:6</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/10-5.htm" title="In the hand of God is the prosperity of man: and upon the person of the scribe shall he lay his honour.">Sir 10:5</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/42-1.htm" title="Of the law of the most High, and his covenant; and of judgment to justify the ungodly;">Sir 42:1</a>, etc.) then the reference would perhaps be to a man looking into his conscience, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “the personality at its birth,” before he had become sin-stained; this being what he was originally meant to be. The Peshiṭtâ simplifies the matter by omitting <span class="greekheb">τῆς γενέσεως</span>, and is followed in this by some minor authorities.—<span class="greekheb">ἐσόπτρῳ</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-11.htm" title="Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away.">Sir 12:11</a> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἔσῃ αὐτῷ ὡς ἐκμεμαχὼς ἔσοπτρον</span>; and <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-26.htm" title="For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.">Wis 7:26</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">23</span>. <span class="ital">he is like unto a man</span> …] The instance is chosen to illustrate the nature of the <span class="ital">paralogism</span> or fallacy by which the man deceived himself. It lies, as said above, in forgetting the self-knowledge which should form a premiss in his argument, and reasoning as if it did not exist.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">beholding his natural face</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">the face of his birth</span>, that which he was born with. The latter word might seem at first almost superfluous, but it serves to point the spiritual interpretation. That which the man sees in the mirror of the Divine Word, is the revelation of himself, as he is by nature (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/14-24.htm" title="But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believes not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all:...">1 Corinthians 14:24-25</a>), weak, sinful, “double-minded.” That revelation is meant to lead him to seek for supernatural strength to rise to the higher life. The word for “beholding” implies more than a passing glance, the man <span class="ital">contemplates</span> the reflection of his face (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-3.htm" title="And why behold you the mote that is in your brother's eye, but consider not the beam that is in your own eye?">Matthew 7:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-24.htm" title="Consider the ravens: for they neither sow nor reap; which neither have storehouse nor barn; and God feeds them: how much more are you better than the fowls?">Luke 12:24</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">in a glass</span>] Better, <span class="bld">in a mirror</span>. The word is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/13-12.htm" title="For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known.">1 Corinthians 13:12</a>. The mirrors in use among the Jews, Greeks, and Romans were of polished metal, and as these presented a less perfect image than our modern mirrors, to see through, i. e. by means of, a mirror had become among the later Rabbis, as well as with St Paul, a proverbial phrase for man’s imperfect knowledge of divine things. Here, however, stress is laid on the fact that the mirror does supply, in some measure, the self-knowledge which the man could not attain without it. The sapiential books of the Apocrypha present two interesting illustrations drawn from the same source (<a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-26.htm" title="For she is the brightness of the everlasting light, the unspotted mirror of the power of God, and the image of his goodness.">Wis 7:26</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/12-11.htm" title="Though he humble himself, and go crouching, yet take good heed and beware of him, and thou shalt be unto him as if thou hadst wiped a lookingglass, and thou shalt know that his rust hath not been altogether wiped away.">Sir 12:11</a>).
