Perhaps there is still a sharper point to the satire: the wrath of man does not work God’s righteousness “to the full.” The warning may well be sounded in the ears of Christians still, who are not less apt than Jonah of old to say quickly and in self-excuse, “I do well to be angry” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/4-9.htm" title="And God said to Jonah, Do you well to be angry for the gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even to death.">Jonah 4:9</a>). How many a holy work of household and parish has been and is thus hindered and destroyed; and if the golden words of the first bishop of the Church had been heeded better, there never had appeared one page of her long history blotted with the blood of a religious war.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:19-21 Instead of blaming God under our trials, let us open our ears and hearts to learn what he teaches by them. And if men would govern their tongues, they must govern their passions. The worst thing we can bring to any dispute, is anger. Here is an exhortation to lay apart, and to cast off as a filthy garment, all sinful practices. This must reach to sins of thought and affection, as well as of speech and practice; to every thing corrupt and sinful. We must yield ourselves to the word of God, with humble and teachable minds. Being willing to hear of our faults, taking it not only patiently, but thankfully. It is the design of the word of God to make us wise to salvation; and those who propose any mean or low ends in attending upon it, dishonour the gospel, and disappoint their own souls.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God - Does not produce in the life that righteousness which God requires. Its tendency is not to incline us to keep the law, but to break it; not to induce us to embrace the truth, but the opposite. The meaning of this passage is not that our wrath will make God either more or less righteous; but that its tendency is not to produce that upright course of life, and love of truth, which God requires. A man is never sure of doing right under the influence of excited feelings; he may do that which is in the highest sense wrong, and which he will regret all his life. The particular meaning of this passage is, that wrath in the mind of man will not have any tendency to make him righteous. It is only that candid state of mind which will lead him to embrace the truth which can be hoped to have such an effect. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. Man's angry zeal in debating, as if jealous for the honor of God's righteousness, is far from working that which is really righteousness in God's sight. True "righteousness is sown in peace," not in wrath (Jas 3:18). The oldest and best reading means "worketh," that is, practiceth not: the received reading is "worketh," produceth not.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/james/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

The preponderance of authorities decides against the reading <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεται</span>, and in favour of <span class="greekheb">ἐργάζεται</span>. From the fact that <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνην</span> is twice in the N.

The opposite of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ ἐργάζεσθαι</span> is <span class="greekheb">ἁμαρτίαν ἐργάζεσθαι</span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-9.htm" title="But if you have respect to persons, you commit sin, and are convinced of the law as transgressors.">Jam 2:9</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-1.htm" title="Judge not, that you be not judged.">Matthew 7:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐργαζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀνομίαν</span>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/9-23.htm" title="Now after the death of Judas the wicked began to put forth their heads in all the coasts of Israel, and there arose up all such as wrought iniquity.">1Ma 9:23</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐργαζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἀδικίαν</span>; also comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-10.htm" title="But glory, honor, and peace, to every man that works good, to the Jew first, and also to the Gentile:">Romans 2:10</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐργαζ</span>. <span class="greekheb">τὸ ἀγαθόν</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-10.htm" title="As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good to all men, especially to them who are of the household of faith.">Galatians 6:10</a>). James was the more constrained to give prominence to this idea, as <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> itself and the words flowing from it were considered by the pharisaical disposition of Christians, against whom this warning is directed, and of whom it was said: <span class="greekheb">ζῆλον Θεοῦ ἔχουσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ οὐ κατʼ ἐπίγνωσιν</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-2.htm" title="For I bear them record that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.">Romans 10:2</a>, as something that was pleasing to God. With the reading <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεται</span> this verb may also be equivalent to effect, to bring about (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-3.htm" title="Knowing this, that the trying of your faith works patience.">Jam 1:3</a>). Gebser, Grashof, and others understand, in accordance with this view, by <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>: “the condition of justification before God;” but, on the one hand, an unsuitable thought is expressed by this, and, on the other hand, a mode of expressing the idea <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη τοῦ Θεοῦ</span>, peculiar to Paul, is without ceremony ascribed to James. But as little is it to be justified when Wiesinger, following Hofmann (<span class="ital">Schriftbew.</span> I. ed. 1, p. 548 f.), finds expressed in the words of James, that “one by wrathful zeal effects not <span class="ital">on others</span> the <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span>, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> that state of righteousness in which God begets men by His word of truth.”[92] Though <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span> can denote the righteousness wrought by God, yet this idea is here unsuitable, since no man could entertain the opinion that his wrath could do what can only be effected by God. Also in this case James would only emphasize an impossibility of <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span>, whereas he was required to bring prominently forward its rejection; moreover, <span class="ital">on others</span> is inserted into the text.[93] The same reasons are also decisive against the explanation of Brückner (“the wrath of man works not the righteousness which God accomplishes—this generally stated both in respect to the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΉΡ</span></span></span> and in respect to others on whom one strives to work”), in which a twofold reference is arbitrarily assumed. Brückner correctly rejects the explanation of Lange, that James speaks against “the delusion of wrath, which imagines to administer and accomplish in the world the righteousness of God especially against unbelievers,” because there is no reference to this in the context; it is, moreover, linguistically unmaintainable, as <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΡΓΆΖΕΣΘΑΙ</span></span></span> does not mean “to administer and accomplish.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΝΔΡΌς</span></span></span> stands here as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">Jam 1:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-12.htm" title="Blessed is the man that endures temptation: for when he is tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.">Jam 1:12</a>; it forms a contrast neither to the <span class="ital">child</span> (Thomas: ira fortis et deliberate non dicit pueri, qui cito transit), nor to the <span class="ital">woman</span> (Bengel: sexns <span class="ital">virilis</span> maxime iram alit), nor to <span class="greekheb">ἄνθρωπος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a> (Lange).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[91] It is true the expression <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη θεοῦ</span> occurs not elsewhere in this sense; but this can be the less an objection to it, as the relation in which the genitive <span class="greekheb">Θεοῦ</span> is placed to <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> is not entirely opposed to the genitive of relation, as is evident if we designate the <span class="greekheb">δικ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Θ</span>. as that <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> which is actually so according to the determination of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[92] In the second edition (p. 628), Hofmann has indeed altered the words, but not the thought, in the explanation given in the first edition. When he defines the distinction in the use of the idea <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη Θεοῦ</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-17.htm" title="For therein is the righteousness of God revealed from faith to faith: as it is written, The just shall live by faith.">Romans 1:17</a> and here, to consist in this, that Paul speaks of justification, in James of regeneration, the untenableness of his explanation is the more evident, for that <span class="greekheb">ὀργή</span> produces regeneration could occur to no one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[93] Contrary to the Biblical use of language, Oecumenius explains the expression <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνη</span> as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἕξις ἑν ψυχῇ κατʼ ἀξίαν ἐκάστῳ ἀκονεμητική</span>. Pott wholly arbitrarily refers the verse to the teachers of the Christian religion, paraphrasing it: iratus nequit docere religionem christianum prout fas est Deoque probatur.—Several commentators (also Kern) to this verse cite <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-21.htm" title="The fear of the Lord driveth away sins: and where it is present, it turneth away wrath.">Sir 1:21</a> : <span class="greekheb">οὐ δυνήσεται θυμὸς ἄδικος δικαιωθῆναι</span>; but incorrectly, since <span class="greekheb">δικαιωθῆναι</span> has an entirely different meaning from <span class="greekheb">κατεργάζεσθαι δικαιοσύνην Θεοῦ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὀργὴ γὰρ</span>, etc.: Man’s wrath is rarely, if ever, justifiable; even “just indignation” is too often intermixed with other elements; and frequently the premisses on which it is founded are at fault. Man, unlike God, never knows all the circumstances of the case. On the subject of anger, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/5-21.htm" title="You have heard that it was said of them of old time, You shall not kill; and whoever shall kill shall be in danger of the judgment:...">Matthew 5:21-22</a>, and <span class="ital">cf.</span> the <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, July, 1905, pp. 28 ff.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. <span class="ital">the wrath of man</span> …] Better, <span class="bld">A man’s wrath</span>, so as to represent the absence of the article in the original. By “the righteousness of God”—the phrase is common to St James and St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-3.htm" title="For they being ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God.">Romans 10:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-21.htm" title="For he has made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him.">2 Corinthians 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-9.htm" title="And be found in him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through the faith of Christ, the righteousness which is of God by faith:">Php 3:9</a>)—is meant the righteousness which God requires and which He also gives. The besetting sin of the Jews was to identify their own anger against what seemed sin and heresy with the Will of God, to think that they did God service by deeds of violence (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/16-2.htm" title="They shall put you out of the synagogues: yes, the time comes, that whoever kills you will think that he does God service.">John 16:2</a>), that they were thus working out His righteousness. The teaching is again after the pattern of the purely ethical books of the Old Testament (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-9.htm" title="Be not hasty in your spirit to be angry: for anger rests in the bosom of fools.">Ecclesiastes 7:9</a>). The MSS. give two forms of the verb rendered “work;” the commonly received one, which conveys the thought, “does not work out or bring to completeness,” and that of the better MSS. which means simply, “does not work, or practise.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/1.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-20.htm" title="For the wrath of man works not the righteousness of God.">Jam 1:20</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὀργὴ</span> <span class="ital">wrath</span>).
