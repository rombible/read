Do we not pray in our Saviour’s words, “Lead us not into temptation”? (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever. Amen.">Matthew 6:13</a>, and Note there.) Yet a little consideration will open out the teaching of Holy Scripture very plainly. The Apostle here is following the same line of thought as that expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/5-14.htm" title="But strong meat belongs to them that are of full age, even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil.">Hebrews 5:14</a>. By use (or <span class= "ital">habit, </span>more properly) our senses may be exercised to the discernment of good and evil. The grace of God given to the soul is capable of growth and enlargement, like the powers of body and mind. If either be unemployed, weakness must supervene, and eventually decay and death. And just as the veteran who has proved his armour well, and learned to face habitual danger as a duty, is more trustworthy than a raw recruit, however large of limb and stout of heart, so with the Christian soldier. He must learn to “endure hardness” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-3.htm" title="You therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ.">2Timothy 2:3</a>), and bear meekly and even gladly all the trials which are to strengthen him for the holy war. Innocence is a grace indeed, and yet there is a higher stage of the same virtue, viz., the purity which has been won by long and often bitter conflict with the thousand suggestions of evil from without, stirring up the natural impurity within. Temptation is not sin. “You cannot,” says the old German divine, “prevent the birds flying over your head, but you can from making nests in your hair;” and the soul victorious over some such trying onset is by that very triumph stronger and better able to undergo the next assault, The act of virtue has, in truth, helped to build up the habit, from which, when it is perfected, a happy life cannot fail to spring. The interpretation of our Lord’s prayer is rather the cry for help to God our Father in the trial, than for actual escape from it: Lead us not, <span class= "ital">i.e.</span>, where we in our free will may choose the wrong and perish. And there is a strangely sweet joy to be snatched from the most grievous temptation in the remembrance that “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1Corinthians 10:13</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/1.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/1-2.htm" title="My brothers, count it all joy when you fall into divers temptations;...">James 1:2-4</a></span>. <span class="ital">Count it all joy </span>— That is, matter of the greatest joy; <span class="ital">when ye fall into divers temptations </span>— <span class="greekheb">Πειρασμοις</span>, <span class="ital">trials; </span>for though rendered <span class="ital">temptations, </span>it does not signify here what is commonly meant by temptations, for these we are directed to pray against, but it denotes <span class="ital">trials </span>by affliction and persecution.

Hence our Lord declared those to be <span class="ital">blessed who were persecuted for righteousness’ sake, </span><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-10.htm" title="Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.">Matthew 5:10</a>; and exhorted such, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-42.htm" title="Give to him that asks you, and from him that would borrow of you turn not you away.">Matthew 5:42</a>,) to <span class="ital">rejoice and be exceeding glad; </span>sentiments which doubtless the Apostle James had in his eye when he spoke to the Jewish Christians in this manner. <span class="ital">Knowing that the trying, </span>or <span class="ital">proving, of your faith </span>— By persecution and affliction; <span class="ital">worketh patience </span>— Exercises and thereby increases your patience, through the divine blessing, and your resignation to God’s will, from which many other virtues will flow. <span class="ital">But let patience have her perfect work </span>— Let it be duly and fully exercised, that it may rise to the highest degree of perfection: 1st, By composing your minds to a sweet and humble frame under your sufferings. 2d, By acknowledging God’s hand in them, and blessing him for them. 3d, By resisting all inclinations to impatience, fretfulness, and murmuring. 4th, By quietly waiting for deliverance, in the way God hath appointed, till he shall see fit to grant <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-5.htm" title="Listen, my beloved brothers, Has not God chosen the poor of this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to them that love him?">James 2:5</a> th, By enduring to the end of the time of your trial; <span class="ital">that ye may be perfect and entire </span>— Adorned with every Christian grace and virtue; <span class="ital">wanting nothing </span>— No kind or degree of grace which God requires to be in you; but may be complete in all the parts of holiness.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-11 Christianity teaches men to be joyful under troubles: such exercises are sent from God's love; and trials in the way of duty will brighten our graces now, and our crown at last. Let us take care, in times of trial, that patience, and not passion, is set to work in us: whatever is said or done, let patience have the saying and doing of it. When the work of patience is complete, it will furnish all that is necessary for our Christian race and warfare. We should not pray so much for the removal of affliction, as for wisdom to make a right use of it. And who does not want wisdom to guide him under trials, both in regulating his own spirit, and in managing his affairs? Here is something in answer to every discouraging turn of the mind, when we go to God under a sense of our own weakness and folly. If, after all, any should say, This may be the case with some, but I fear I shall not succeed, the promise is, To any that asketh, it shall be given. A mind that has single and prevailing regard to its spiritual and eternal interest, and that keeps steady in its purposes for God, will grow wise by afflictions, will continue fervent in devotion, and rise above trials and oppositions. When our faith and spirits rise and fall with second causes, there will be unsteadiness in our words and actions. This may not always expose men to contempt in the world, but such ways cannot please God. No condition of life is such as to hinder rejoicing in God. Those of low degree may rejoice, if they are exalted to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom of God; and the rich may rejoice in humbling providences, that lead to a humble and lowly disposition of mind. Worldly wealth is a withering thing. Then, let him that is rich rejoice in the grace of God, which makes and keeps him humble; and in the trials and exercises which teach him to seek happiness in and from God, not from perishing enjoyments.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>My brethren - Not brethren as Jews, but as Christians. Compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>.<p>Count it all joy - Regard it as a thing to rejoice in; a matter which should afford you happiness. You are not to consider it as a punishment, a curse, or a calamity, but as a fit subject of felicitation. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-12.htm">Matthew 5:12</a>.<p>When ye fall into divers temptations - Oh the meaning of the word "temptations," see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>. It is now commonly used in the sense of placing allurements before others to induce them to sin, and in this sense the word seems to be used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13-14</a> of this chapter. Here, however, the word is used in the sense of trials, to wit, by persecution, poverty, calamity of any kind. These cannot be said to be direct inducements or allurements to sin, but they try the faith, and they show whether he who is tried is disposed to adhere to his faith in God, or whether he will apostatize. They so far coincide with temptations, properly so called, as to test the religion of men. They differ from temptations, properly so called, in that they are not brought before the mind for the express purpose of inducing people to sin. In this sense it is true that God never tempts men, <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/1-13.htm">James 1:13-14</a>. On the sentiment in the passage before us, see the notes at <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm">1 Peter 1:6-7</a>. The word "divers" here refers to the various kinds of trials which they might experience - sickness, poverty, bereavement, persecution, etc. They were to count it a matter of joy that their religion was subjected to anything that tried it. It is well for us to have the reality of our religion tested, in whatever way it may be done. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

Not only according to the flesh, he being a Jew as they were; but in a spiritual sense, they being born again of the same grace, belonging to the same family and household of faith, and having the same Father, and being all the children of God, by faith in Christ Jesus: <p>count it all joy when ye fall into divers temptations; not the temptations of Satan, or temptations to sin; for these cannot be matter of joy, but grief; these are fiery darts, and give a great deal of uneasiness and trouble; but afflictions and persecutions for the sake of the Gospel, which are so called here and elsewhere, because they are trials of the faith of God's people, and of other graces of the Spirit of God. God by these tempts his people, as he did Abraham, when he called him to sacrifice his son; he thereby tried his faith, fear, love, and obedience; so by afflictions, God tries the graces of his people; not that he might know them, for he is not ignorant of them, but that they might be made manifest to others; and these are "divers": many are the afflictions of the righteous; through much tribulation they must enter the kingdom; it is a great fight of afflictions which they endure, as these believers did; their trials came from different quarters; they were persecuted by their countrymen the Jews, and were distressed by the Gentiles, among whom they lived; and their indignities and reproaches were many; and their sufferings of different sorts, as confiscation of goods, imprisonment of body, banishment, scourgings, and death in various shapes: and these they "fall" into; not by chance, nor altogether at an unawares, or unexpectedly; but they fell into them through the wickedness and malice of their enemies, and did not bring them upon themselves through any crime or enormity they were guilty of: and when this was their case, the apostle exhorts them to count it all joy, or matter of joy, of exceeding great joy, even of the greatest joy; not that these afflictions were joyous in themselves, but in their circumstances, effects, and consequences; as they tried, and exercised, and improved the graces of the Spirit, and worked for their good, spiritual and eternal, and produced in them the peaceable fruit of righteousness; and as they were attended with the presence and Spirit of God, and of glory; and as they made for, and issued in the glory of God; and because of that great reward in heaven which would follow them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-11.htm">Matthew 5:11</a>.

Yet there is nothing in the context which necessitates us to such a limitation; rather the additional epithet <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΟΊΚΙΛΟΙ</span></span></span> justifies us to extend the idea, and to understand by it all the relations of life which might induce the Christian to withdraw from the faith, or to become wavering in it.

It is true that the exhortation to look upon temptations with joy is scarcely compatible with the prayer, “Lead us not into temptation” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm" title="And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For your is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.

Most pointedly does Parry remark: “There is a true joy for the warrior when he meets face to face the foe whom he has been directed to subjugate, in a warfare that trains hand and eye and steels the nerve and tempers the will …”; this is precisely the Jewish standpoint; while the Christian, realising his sinfulness and inherent weakness, and grounded in a spirit of humility, reiterates the words which he has been taught in the Lord’s Prayer. This passage is one of the many in the Epistle which makes it so difficult to believe that it can all have been written by St. James.—<span class="greekheb">περιπέσητε</span>: the connection in which this word stands in the few passages of the N.T. which contain it supports the idea that in <span class="greekheb">πειρασμοῖς</span> external trials are included (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-30.htm" title="And Jesus answering said, A certain man went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves, which stripped him of his raiment, and wounded him, and departed, leaving him half dead.">Luke 10:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-41.htm" title="And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmovable, but the hinder part was broken with the violence of the waves.">Acts 27:41</a>).—<span class="greekheb">ποικίλοις</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1 Peter 1:6</a>., <span class="greekheb">ἐν ποικίλοις πειρασμοῖς</span>, Pesh. adds <span class="greekheb">πολλοῖς</span>, <span class="ital">cf.</span> 3Ma 2:6, <span class="greekheb">ποικίλαις καὶ πολλαῖς δοκιμάσας τιμωρίαις</span><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/1.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">2</span>. <span class="ital">count it all joy</span> …] We lose, in the English, the link which connects the wish for “joy” merged in our “greeting,” with the thought which indicates how the wish may be realised even under conditions that seem most adverse to it. The transition may be noticed as characteristic of the style of the Epistle. Other examples of a like method will meet us as we go on. The Greek formula for “all joy” (literally, <span class="bld">every kind of joy</span>) suggests the thought of the varied elements of joy that were to be found in the manifold forms of trial.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">into divers temptations</span>] The word, as commonly in the New Testament, stands for trials that take the form of suffering, rather than for the enticements of pleasure. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-28.htm" title="You are they which have continued with me in my temptations.">Luke 22:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-19.htm" title="Serving the LORD with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews:">Acts 20:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-13.htm" title="There has no temptation taken you but such as is common to man: but God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you are able; but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that you may be able to bear it.">1 Corinthians 10:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-6.htm" title="Wherein you greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need be, you are in heaviness through manifold temptations:">1 Peter 1:6</a>. Its use implies accordingly that those to whom the Epistle was written were passing through a time of adversity. This was true, more or less, of the whole Jewish race, everywhere, but it was specially true of those who being of the Twelve Tribes, also held the faith of the Lord Jesus Christ, and of those most of all who were most within the writer’s view. Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-14.htm" title="For you, brothers, became followers of the churches of God which in Judaea are in Christ Jesus: for you also have suffered like things of your own countrymen, even as they have of the Jews:">1 Thessalonians 2:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/hebrews/10-32.htm" title="But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were illuminated, you endured a great fight of afflictions;...">Hebrews 10:32-33</a>, for the sufferings of Jewish and specially of Hebrew Christians.

Here it has its proper force, and signifies <span class="accented">that by which the faith is tried</span>, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> the instrument of trial rather than the process of trial. Thus the passage in ver. 3 becomes parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-3.htm">Romans 5:3</a>, "tribulation worketh patience." With regard to the sentiments of ver. 2, "Count it all joy," etc., contrast <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-13.htm">Matthew 6:13</a>. Experience, however, shows that the two are compatible. It is quite possible to shrink beforehand from temptation, and pray with intense earnestness, "Lead us not into temptation," and yet, when the temptation comes, to meet it joyfully, <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;</span>.

But the epithet "manifold" would indicate that we should not confine the word here to trials such as those. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>All joy (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3bd; &#x3c7;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#768;&#x3bd;)<p>Joy follows up the rejoice of the greeting.
