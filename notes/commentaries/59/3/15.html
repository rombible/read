He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>This wisdom descendeth not from above - Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-3.htm">1 Corinthians 3:3</a>. The wisdom here referred to is that carnal or worldly wisdom which produces strife and contention; that kind of knowledge which leads to self-conceit, and which prompts a man to defend his opinions with over-heated zeal. In the contentions which are in the world, in church and state, in neighborhoods and families, at the bar, in political life, and in theological disputes, even where there is the manifestation of enraged and irascible feeling, there is often much of a certain kind of wisdom. There is learning, shrewdness, tact, logical skill, subtle and skilful argumentation - "making the worse appear the better reason;" but all this is often connected with a spirit so narrow, bigoted, and contentious, as to show clearly that it has not its origin in heaven. The spirit which is originated there is always connected with gentleness, calmness, and a love of truth.<p>But is earthly - Has its origin in this world, and partakes of its spirit. It is such as men exhibit who are governed only by worldly maxims and principles.<p>Sensual - Margin, "natural." The meaning is, that it has its origin in our sensual rather than in our intellectual and moral nature. It is that which takes counsel of our natural appetites and propensities, and not of high and spiritual influences.<p>devilish - Demoniacal (&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  daimonio&#772;de&#772;s).

But this was not “the wisdom” of which the “many teachers” of the party of the Circumcision were boasting. It was, however, that of the Proverbs of Solomon, and of the Wisdom of the Son of Sirach, on which so much of St James’s teaching was modelled. (Comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/1-1.htm" title="All wisdom cometh from the Lord, and is with him for ever....">Sir 1:1-10</a>.) It was that which had been manifested to mankind in all its fulness in Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">earthly, sensual, devilish</span>] Each word is full of meaning. (1) The counterfeit wisdom is “earthly” in its nature and origin as contrasted with that which cometh from above. (Comp. St Paul’s “who mind <span class="ital">earthly</span> things,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/3-19.htm" title="Whose end is destruction, whose God is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.)">Php 3:19</a>). (2) It is “sensual.” The word is used by classical writers for that which belongs to the “soul” as contrasted with the “body.” This rested on the twofold division of man’s nature. The psychology of the New Testament, however, assumes generally the threefold division of body, soul, and spirit, the second element answering to the animal, emotional life, and the third being that which includes reason and will, the capacity for immortality and for knowing God. Hence the adjective formed from “soul” acquired a lower meaning, almost the very opposite of that which it once had, and expresses man’s state as left to lower impulses without the control of the spirit. So St Paul contrasts the <span class="ital">natural</span> man with the spiritual (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>), the <span class="ital">natural</span> and the spiritual body (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-44.htm" title="It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.">1 Corinthians 15:44</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-46.htm" title="However, that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.">1 Corinthians 15:46</a>). So St Jude describes the false teachers, whom he condemns as “<span class="ital">sensual</span>, having not the Spirit.” What St James says then of the false wisdom is that it belongs to the lower, not the higher, element in man’s nature. It does not come from the Spirit of God, and therefore is not spiritual. (3) In “devilish” we have yet a darker condemnation. Our English use of the same word, “devil,” for the two Greek words <span class="ital">diabolos</span> and <span class="ital">dœmonion</span>, tends, however, to obscure St James’s meaning. The epithet does not state that the false wisdom which he condemns came from <span class="ital">the</span> devil, or was like his nature, but that it was <span class="bld">demon-like</span>, as partaking of the nature of the “demons” or “unclean spirits,” who, as in the Gospels, are represented as possessing the souls of men, and reducing them to the level of madness. Such, St James says, is the character of the spurious wisdom of the “many masters” of <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">James 3:1</a>. Met together in debate, wrangling, cursing, swearing, one would take them for an assembly of demoniacs. Their disputes were marked by the ferocity, the egotism, the boasting, the malignant cunning of the insane. St Paul’s account of the “doctrines of devils,” i. e. proceeding from demons (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>), not from the Spirit of God, presents a striking parallel. St James’s previous allusion to “demons” (see note on ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm" title="You believe that there is one God; you do well: the devils also believe, and tremble.">James 2:19</a>) confirms the interpretation thus given, as shewing how much his thoughts had been directed to the phænomena of possession.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-15.htm" title="This wisdom descends not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish.">Jam 3:15</a>.

The <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> in general in the New Testament is that which is common to man with the brute creation, including the passions, appetites, etc.; and therefore, by the use of this word <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> to describe the wisdom which cometh not from above, but is "earthly, sensual [or, 'animal'], devilish," we are reminded of the contrast between the spirit of man which goeth upward and the spirit of a beast which goeth downward (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/3-21.htm">Ecclesiastes 3:21</a>). The "animal" man, then, is one who is ruled entirely by the <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3c5;&#x3c7;&#x1f75;</span> in the lower sense of the word; and by the depreciatory sense given to the adjective we are strongly reminded that "nature" is nothing without the aid of grace.
