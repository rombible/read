His worship and praise are, as explained under <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-6.htm" title="And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the tongue among our members, that it defiles the whole body, and sets on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of hell.">James 3:6</a>, the right use of the tongue; but, most inconsistently, <span class= "ital">therewith curse we</span> men which have <span class= "ital">been made in the image, after the similitude, of God.</span> See Ps. 1. 16-23, with its final words of warning to the wicked, and praise “to him that ordereth his conversation right.”<p>The “likeness of God” assuredly remains in the most abandoned and fallen; and to curse it is to invoke the wrath of its Creator. What then can be urged in defence of anathemas and fulminations of councils, or the mutual execrations of sects and schisms, in the light of these solemn words? “Though they curse, yet bless thou . . . and let them cover themselves with their own confusion” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/psalms/109-28.htm" title="Let them curse, but bless you: when they arise, let them be ashamed; but let your servant rejoice.">Psalm 109:28-29</a>).<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God....">James 3:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Therewith bless we God </span>— That is, therewith mankind bless God; for the apostle, as appears from the next clause, did not speak of himself particularly, or of his fellow-apostles, or even of true private Christians, who certainly do not <span class="ital">curse men. </span>Perhaps in this last clause he glanced at the unconverted Jews, who often cursed the Christians bitterly in their synagogues. <span class="ital">Made after the similitude of God </span>— Which we have indeed now lost, but yet there remains from thence an indelible nobleness, which we ought to reverence, both in ourselves and others. <span class="ital">Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing </span>— And the same tongue is often the instrument of expressing both; and “too frequently,” says Doddridge, “when the act of devotion is over, the act of slander, or outrage and insult, commences.” <span class="ital">My brethren, these things ought not so to be </span>— At least among those who profess Christianity; it is a shame that any such thing should be found in human nature; and it is a still greater shame that any thing of the kind should be practised by any that profess to be the disciples of Him who was manifested to destroy the works of the devil.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Therewith bless we God - We men do this; that is, all this is done by the tongue. The apostle does not mean that the same man does this, but that all this is done by the same organ - the tongue.<p>Even the Father - Who sustains to us the relation of a father. The point in the remark of the apostle is, the absurdity of employing the tongue in such contradictory uses as to bless one who has to us the relation of a father, and to curse any being, especially those who are made in his image. The word bless here is used in the sense of praise, thank, worship.<p>And therewith curse we men - That is, it is done by the same organ by which God is praised and honored.<p>Which are made after the similitude of God - After his image, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26-27</a>.

God&#8212;The oldest authorities read, "Lord." "Him who is Lord and Father." The uncommonness of the application of "Lord" to the Father, doubtless caused the change in modern texts to "God" (Jas 1:27). But as Messiah is called "Father," Isa 9:6, so God the Father is called by the Son's title, "Lord": showing the unity of the Godhead. "Father" implies His paternal love; "Lord," His dominion.<p>men, which&#8212;not "men who"; for what is meant is not particular men, but men genetically [Alford].<p>are made after &#8230; similitude of God&#8212;Though in a great measure man has lost the likeness of God in which he was originally made, yet enough of it still remains to show what once it was, and what in regenerated and restored man it shall be. We ought to reverence this remnant and earnest of what man shall be in ourselves and in others. "Absalom has fallen from his father's favor, but the people still recognize him to be the king's son" [Bengel]. Man resembles in humanity the Son of man, "the express image of His person" (Heb 1:3), compare Ge 1:26; 1Jo 4:20. In the passage, Ge 1:26, "image" and "likeness" are distinct: "image," according to the Alexandrians, was something in which men were created, being common to all, and continuing to man after the fall, while the "likeness" was something toward which man was created, to strive after and attain it: the former marks man's physical and intellectual, the latter his moral pre-eminence.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Therewith bless we God; </span> pray, and speak well of God. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Even the Father; </span> of Christ, and in him of all true believers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And therewith curse we men; </span> rail on, revile, speak evil of, as well as wish evil to. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which are made after the similitude of God; </span> either: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

It is to be observed that this expression, as the first person plural shows, refers to Christians among whom the <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖν τὸν κύριον</span> occurs. James does not hesitate to include himself, knowing that naturally he was entirely the same as others.[177] James first places beside each other, by a simple copulative conjunction, the two contradictory acts which man performs by the tongue, namely, the <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖν τὸν κύριον</span> and the <span class="greekheb">καταρᾶσθαι τοὺς ἀνθρώπους</span>. The preposition <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> is instrumental, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-29.htm" title="And I appoint to you a kingdom, as my Father has appointed to me;">Luke 22:29</a> and elsewhere. By the repetition of <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῇ</span> in the second clause, the antithesis is yet more strongly marked. <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖν</span> and <span class="greekheb">καταρᾶσθαι</span> are correlate expressions, since the former, as the translation of the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">בֵּרֵךְ</span>, has properly the meaning “to bless;” in reference to God, as here, it means laudibus celebrare, to praise; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/145-21.htm" title="My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh bless his holy name for ever and ever.">Psalm 145:21</a>, and other passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The combination of <span class="greekheb">τὸν κύριον καὶ πατέρα</span> (instead of the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸΝ ΘΕῸΝ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Π</span>.<span class="greekheb"></span></span></span>) as a designation of God (for by <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΎΡΙΟς</span></span></span> is not here to be understood Christ) is unusual; comp. chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">Jam 1:27</a>. This twofold name designates God on the side of His power and on the side of His love (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-25.htm" title="At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hid these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes.">Matthew 11:25</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the second clause the important description: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪς ΚΑΘʼ ὉΜΟΊΩΣΙΝ ΘΕΟῦ ΓΕΓΟΝΌΤΑς</span></span></span>, is annexed to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤΟῪς ἈΝΘΡΏΠΟΥς</span></span></span>, by which the contradiction of the action described still more pointedly appears. The thought and expression agree with <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>. Also, according to this, sinful man is still a being created after the image of God. Were the expression merely to be referred to what man originally was, but which he has ceased to be, the point of James’ saying would be broken. Bengel correctly observes: remanet nobilitas <span class="ital">indelebilis.</span> Benson, Pott, Gebser, and Semler arbitrarily restrict the contents of this verse to the conduct of those who set themselves up as teachers.[178]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[177] Lange finds a difficulty in James including himself, “which is to be solved either by taking the second clause as a question expressive of surprise, or by hearing James speak as the representative of his people in the name of the guilty people.” But both suppositions are equally impossible; the context contradicts the first, and the fact that James could have no reason to consider himself as the representative of the Jewish people contradicts the second.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[178] Semler’s view is very strange: hi inter publicas Dei laudes, etiam exsecrationes et tristia omnia praeibant in <span class="ital">Romanis!</span> It is equally a mistake when Lange refers the expression chiefly to Christians, and specially to Jewish Christians, “in whom the likeness of God, that is, the actuality and visibility of the image, <span class="ital">has reappeared.</span>”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">Jam 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἐν αὐτῇ</span>: this is Hebrew usage, <span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">εἰ πατάξομεν ἐν μαχαίρῃ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-49.htm" title="When they which were about him saw what would follow, they said to him, Lord, shall we smite with the sword?">Luke 22:49</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἀποκτεῖναι ἐν ῥομφαίᾳ</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/6-8.htm" title="And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat on him was Death, and Hell followed with him.

Although the Jews frequently speak of God as “Father,” it is usually in a different combination, probably the most usual being “Our Father” alone, or “Our Father and King”; in the great prayer called the “Shemôneh ‘Esreh” (“Eighteen” [Nineteen] Blessings), which was formulated in its final form about the year 110 A.D., each of the forty-four petitions which it contains begins with the words: <span class="ital">Abinu Malkênu</span>[58] (“Our Father, our King”). <span class="greekheb">Πατήρ</span> is always used in reference to God in order to emphasise the divine love; and in the passage before us a contrast is undoubtedly implied between the love of the Father towards all His children, and the mutual hatred among these latter.—<span class="greekheb">f1καταρώμεθα</span>: this word shows that the special sin of the tongue which is here referred to is not slander or backbiting or lying, but personal abuse, such as results from loss of temper in heated controversy. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-13.htm" title="Distributing to the necessity of saints; given to hospitality.">Romans 12:13</a>, <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖτε καὶ μὴ καταρᾶσθε</span>, and see the very appropriate passage in the <span class="ital">Test. of the Twelve Patriarchs</span>, Benj. 6:5, <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀγαθὴ διάνοια οὐκ ἔχει δύο γλώσσας εὐλογίας καὶ κατάρας</span>.—<span class="greekheb">τοὺς καθʼ ὁμοίωσιν Θεοῦ γεγονότας</span>: quoted, apparently from memory, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm" title="And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth.">Genesis 1:26</a>, where the Septuagint reads, <span class="greekheb">κατʼ εἰκόνα ἡμετέραν καὶ καθʼ ὁμοίωσιν</span>; the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">דמות</span> (<span class="greekheb">ὁμοίωσις</span>) is synonymous with <span class="greekheb">צלם</span> (<span class="greekheb">εἰκών</span>). The belief that men are made in the material likeness of God is taught both in Biblical and post-Biblical Jewish literature; philosophers like Philo would naturally seek to modify this. An interesting passage which reminds one of this verse is quoted by Knowling from <span class="ital">Bereshith</span>, R. xxiv., Rabbi Akiba (born in the middle of the first century A.D.), in commenting on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm" title="Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: for in the image of God made he man.">Genesis 9:6</a>, said: “Whoso sheddeth blood, it is reckoned to him as if he diminished <span class="ital">the likeness</span>”; then referring presently to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-18.htm" title="You shall not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the children of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the LORD.">Leviticus 19:18</a> (<span class="ital">Thou shalt not take vengeance, nor bear any grudge against the children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself</span>), he continues, “Do not say: ‘after that I am despised, let my neighbour also be despised’. R. Tanchuma said, ‘If you do so, understand that you despise him of whom it was written, <span class="ital">in the likeness of God made He him</span>’.” The lesson is that he who curses him who was made in the image of God implicitly curses the prototype as well.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[58] To be distinguished from the “Abinu Malkênu” prayer used in the penitential portion of the Jewish Liturgy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">Therewith bless we God, even the Father …</span>] Many of the better MSS. give “the Lord” instead of “God”. The fact dwelt on comes in to illustrate the strange inconsistency, even of men who professed faith in God, in their use of speech. General as the words are, they pointed, we may believe, especially to the feelings of Jews towards Christians, or of the more bigoted section of Jewish Christians towards the Gentiles. Such men were loud in their benedictions of the Eternal, the Blessed One, yet they had not learnt to reverence humanity as such, as made after the likeness of God. They cursed those who worshipped or believed after a different manner from their own. The annals of Christendom shew that the necessity for the warning has not passed away. Councils formulating the faith, and uttering their curses on heretics; <span class="ital">Te Deums</span> chanted at an <span class="ital">Auto da Fè</span>, or after a Massacre of St Bartholomew, the railings of religious parties who are restrained from other modes of warfare, present the same melancholy inconsistency.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-9.htm" title="Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.">Jam 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν αὐτῇ</span>—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν αὐτῇ</span>, <span class="ital">with this itself</span>—<span class="ital">and with this itself</span>) A very expressive phrase.—<span class="greekheb">Θεὸν</span>) <span class="ital">God</span>. <span class="greekheb">Κύριον</span>, <span class="ital">Lord</span>[39]) is the reading of the Alexandrian, Colbertinus 7, and Syriac texts.

Theologically they are important, as showing that the "likeness of God" in man (in whatever it may consist) was not entirely obliterated by the Fall.

So St. Paul speaks of fallen man as still "the image (<span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3ba;&#x1f7d;&#x3bd;</span>) and glory of God" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-7.htm">1 Corinthians 11:7</a>; and cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>God, even the Father (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;)<p>The proper reading is &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x39a;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;, the Lord, and the &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, and, is simply connective.
