The very human weakness of Peter, and Paul, and James, endears them to us; for so we know assuredly that they were “men of like passions” with ourselves (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-15.htm" title="And saying, Sirs, why do you these things?

To “offend” means to stumble over something, and fall, and in this sense we get the exact meaning of “offending” by an unguarded allusion to a subject painful in the mind of another. “A constant governance of our speech, according to duty and reason, is a high instance, and a special argument of a thoroughly sincere and solid goodness,” says Isaac Barrow; but the meekest of men failed once, and blessed indeed is he who takes heed to his ways that he sins not with his tongue (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/39-1.htm" title="I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.">Psalm 39:1</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Able also to bridle the whole body.</span>—Not that if the tongue be stilled all the members of the body are consequently in peace; but, because the work of ruling the one rebel is so great, that a much less corresponding effort will keep the others in subjection.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For in many things we offend all - We all offend. The word here rendered offend, means to stumble, to fall; then to err, to fail in duty; and the meaning here is, that all were liable to commit error, and that this consideration should induce men to be cautious in seeking an office where an error would be likely to do so much injury. The particular thing, doubtless, which the apostle had in his eye, was the peculiar liability to commit error, or to do wrong with the tongue. Of course, this liability is very great in an office where the very business is public speaking. If anywhere the improper use of the tongue will do mischief, it is in the office of a religious teacher; and to show the danger of this, and the importance of caution in seeking that office, the apostle proceeds to show what mischief the tongue is capable of effecting.<p>If any man offend not in word - In his speech; in the use of his tongue.<p>The same is a perfect man - Perfect in the sense in which the apostle immediately explains himself; that he is able to keep every other member of his body in subjection. His object is not to represent the man as absolutely spotless in every sense, and as wholly free from sin, for he had himself just said that "all offend in many things;" but the design is to show that if a man can control his tongue, he has complete dominion over himself, as much as a man has over a horse by the bit, or as a steersman has over a ship if he has hold of the rudder. He is perfect in that sense, that he has complete control over himself, and will not be liable to error in anything. The design is to show the important position which the tongue occupies, as governing the whole man. On the meaning of the word perfect, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-1.htm">Job 1:1</a>.<p>And able also to bridle the whole body - To control his whole body, that is, every other part of himself, as a man does a horse by the bridle. The word rendered "to bridle," means to lead or guide with a bit; then to rein in, to check, to moderate, to restrain. A man always has complete government over himself if he has the entire control of his tongue. It is that by which he gives expression to his thoughts and passions; and if that is kept under proper restraint, all the rest of his members are as easily controlled as the horse is by having the control of the bit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. all&#8212;The Greek implies "all without exception": even the apostles.<p>offend not&#8212;literally "stumbleth not": is void of offence or "slip" in word: in which respect one is especially tried who sets up to be a "teacher."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For in many things we offend all:</span> there is no man absolutely free from sin, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-46.htm" title="If they sin against you, (for there is no man that sins not,) and you be angry with them, and deliver them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives to the land of the enemy, far or near;">1 Kings 8:46</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/14-4.htm" title="Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.">Job 14:4</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-9.htm" title="Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?">Proverbs 20:9</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/7-20.htm" title="For there is not a just man on earth, that does good, and sins not.">Ecclesiastes 7:20</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-8.htm" title="If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.">1Jo 1:8</a>,10</span>; and therefore we must not be too critical in other men’s actions, having so many failings ourselves, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-1.htm" title="Brothers, if a man be overtaken in a fault, you which are spiritual, restore such an one in the spirit of meekness; considering yourself, lest you also be tempted.">Galatians 6:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">If any man offend not in word; </span> know how to govern his tongue aright, speak what, and when; as he ought. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The same is a perfect man; </span> either sincere, in opposition to the hypocrisy of those that pretend so great zeal in correcting others, when they are alike or more guilty themselves: or rather, we may understand it comparatively, and with respect to others, of one that hath made good proficiency in religion, and is of greater attainments than others: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm" title="However, we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nothing:">1 Corinthians 2:6</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And able also to bridle the whole body; </span> to govern all the other parts, (eyes, ears, hands, &c.,) as to those actions which are performed by them.

Or "we all offend", slip and fall; no man lives without sin; in many, in most, if not in all things, a good man himself does, he sins; and this extends to the most solemn services, and best works of a good man; there is sin in his holy things, imperfections in all his performances; his righteousnesses are as filthy rags; hence no man can be justified by his works before God, nor is any man perfect in this life, so as to be without sin in himself: the apostle includes himself in this account, and that not out of modesty merely, or in a complaisant way, but as matter of fact, and what he found in himself, and observed in the conduct of his life: and now this is given as a reason why persons should not be anxious of teaching others, since in many instances, in common speech and conversation, men are apt to offend, and much more in a work which requires a multitude of words; or why men should be careful how they charge, censure, and reprove others, in a rash, furious, and unchristian manner; since they themselves are in the body, and may be tempted, and are attended with many infirmities, slips, and falls in common life. <p>If any man offend not in word; from slips and falls in general, the apostle proceeds to the slips of the tongue, and to the use and abuse of that member; and his sense is, that if a man has so much guard upon himself, and such a command over his tongue, and so much wisdom to use it, as to give no offence by it, to his fellow creatures, and fellow Christians: <p>the same is a perfect man; not that he is perfect in himself, and without sin, that is denied before; unless this is considered as a mere hypothesis, and by way of concession; that could there be found out a man that never, for instance, offends in word in anyone part of life, that man may be allowed, and be set down to be a perfect man; but no such man is to be found, and therefore none perfect: but rather the sense is, that he who in common is so careful of his speech, as not to offend his brethren, may be looked upon as a sincere and truly religious man; See <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm">James 1:26</a> or he may be accounted a wise and prudent man, such an one as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-13.htm">James 3:13</a> he is not a babe in understanding, a child in conduct, but a grown man; at full age; a perfect man; in which sense the word is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-6.htm">1 Corinthians 2:6</a>. <p>And able also to bridle the whole body; either to govern the whole body, the church, to teach a society of Christians, and to feed them with knowledge, and with understanding; or rather, as he appears to be able to bridle that member of the body, the tongue, so likewise to be able, through the grace of God, to keep under the whole body, that sin shall not reign in it, or the lusts of it be in common obeyed. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For in many things we offend all. <span class="cverse3">{3}</span> If any man offend not in word, the same <i>is</i> a perfect man, <i>and</i> able also to bridle the whole body.</span><p>(3) The seventh place, concerning the bridling of the tongue, joined with the former, so that it is revealed that there is no man in who can not justly be found fault as well, seeing as it is a rare virtue to bridle the tongue.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all.

The reason (<span class="greekheb">γάρ</span>) of the preceding; yet not so much of the warning: <span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">γίνεσθε</span> (Schneckenburger),—this is conditioned by <span class="greekheb">εἰδότες κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.,—as rather of the thought <span class="greekheb">μεῖζον κρῖμα ληψόμεθα</span>; namely, so that the first clause refers only to <span class="greekheb">κρῖμα ληψόμεθα</span>, and only that which follows to the idea <span class="greekheb">μεῖζον</span>; whilst in the expression <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. the idea is contained, that as <span class="greekheb">οὐ πταίειν ἐν λόγῳ</span> conditions <span class="greekheb">τελειότης</span>, sinful man is thus not in a position to bridle the tongue. Brückner incorrectly considers the clause <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. as the explanatory reason of the directly preceding sentence: “we all offend frequently, <span class="ital">for</span> whosoever offends not in word he only preserves himself from <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ πταίειν</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words <span class="greekheb">πολλὰ πταίομεν ἅπαντες</span>] are to be taken in their widest sense (Wiesinger, Brückner); by <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντες</span> (a stronger form than <span class="greekheb">πάντες</span>) neither the <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλοι</span> simply are meant, nor is it = <span class="ital">plerique</span> (Grotius), and <span class="greekheb">πταίειν</span> points not expressly to errores, qui docentibus obvenire possint (Grotius), or to “speech which is used in teaching” (de Wette), but it comprehends all and every moral error of whatever kind it may be.[169]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πολλά</span>] is adverbial, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-14.htm" title="Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but your disciples fast not?">Matthew 9:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>To this first thought that which follows is annexed <span class="greekheb">ἀσυνδέτως</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἴ τις</span>] see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-5.htm" title="If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that gives to all men liberally, and upbraides not; and it shall be given him.">Jam 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-23.htm" title="For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like to a man beholding his natural face in a glass:">Jam 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-26.htm" title="If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridles not his tongue, but deceives his own heart, this man's religion is vain.">Jam 1:26</a> = <span class="greekheb">ὅστις</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ</span>] is not to be limited to teaching proper (Pott = <span class="greekheb">ἐν διδασκαλίᾳ</span>), but is equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἐν τῷ λαλῆσαι</span>, chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-19.htm" title="Why, my beloved brothers, let every man be swift to hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:">Jam 1:19</a>; <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> denotes the sphere within which the <span class="greekheb">οὐ πταίειν</span> occurs; otherwise in chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-10.htm" title="For whoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one point, he is guilty of all.">Jam 2:10</a>.

James here places the body in opposition to the man “as a relative independent power which offers moral resistance to the will of the Ego” (Wiesinger), which it is his task to bridle. The <span class="greekheb">καρδία</span>, indeed, is the fountain of evil deeds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-19.htm" title="For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:">Matthew 15:19</a>), but the lust which is rooted therein has so thoroughly appropriated <span class="ital">the members</span> of man, and as it were fixed its dwelling in them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-23.htm" title="But I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.">Romans 7:23</a>), that they appear as lusting subjects, and may be represented as such in lively concrete language. By such explanations as <span class="greekheb">ὅλον τὸ σῶμα</span>, equivalent to “the whole connection of the actions and changes of man” (Baumgarten), or = reliquae peccandi illecebrae (Pott), or = tota vita (Schneckenburger), the idea lying at the foundation does not receive its full meaning. Even the remark of de Wette, that <span class="greekheb">τὸ σῶμα</span> denotes “not only all organs proper, but even the affections,” is not to be retained; on which account Brückner adds: “the latter only in so far as they are expressed by the former.” The explanation of Lange is also arbitrary, that the body here denotes the organ and <span class="ital">symbol</span> of all other modes of human action, with the exception of speech. Laurentius rightly observes: nihil obstat, quo minus per totum corpus intelligamus caetera corporis nostri membra: manus, pedes, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[169] Brückner correctly asserts, against de Wette, that the subject in <span class="greekheb">ἅπαντες</span> has experienced an extension, and that the circumstance that in what follows <span class="greekheb">ἐν λόγῳ πταίειν</span> is particularly brought forward, requires for <span class="greekheb">πταίειν</span> here a more universal meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-2.htm" title="For in many things we offend all.
