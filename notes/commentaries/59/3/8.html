St. James does not mean that no one can tame his own tongue, for so he would hardly be responsible for its vagaries; and lower down it is written expressly, “these things ought not so to be.” The hopeless savagery of the tongue, excelling the fury of wild beasts, must be that of the liar, the traducer, and blasphemer.

Psalms 140)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:1-12 We are taught to dread an unruly tongue, as one of the greatest evils. The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But the tongue can no man tame - This does not mean that it is never brought under control, but that it is impossible effectually and certainly to subdue it. It would be possible to subdue and domesticate any kind of beasts, but this could not be done with the tongue.<p>It is an unruly evil - An evil without restraint, to which no certain and effectual check can be applied. Of the truth of this no one can have any doubt, who looks at the condition of the world.<p>Full of deadly poison - That is, it acts on the happiness of man, and on the peace of society, as poison does on the human frame. The allusion here seems to be to the bite of a venomous reptile. Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/140-3.htm">Psalm 140:3</a>, "They have sharpened their tongues like serpent; adders" poison is under their lips." <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/3-13.htm">Romans 3:13</a>, "with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips." Nothing would better describe the mischief that may be done by the tongue. There is no sting of a serpent that does so much evil in the world; there is no poison more deadly to the frame than the poison of the tongue is to the happiness of man. Who, for example, can stand before the power of the slanderer? What mischief can be done in society that can be compared with that which he may do?<p> - 'Tis slander;<p>Whose edge is sharper than the sword; whose tongue<p>Outvenoms all the worms of Nile; whose breath<p>Rides on the posting winds, and doth belie<p>All corners of the world: kings, queens, and states,<p>Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave<p>This viperous slander enters.<p>Shakespeare in Cymbellna. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>8. no man&#8212;literally, "no one of men": neither can a man control his neighbor's, nor even his own tongue.

Either his own, or others; not his own, for the man that has the greatest guard upon himself, his words and actions; yet, what through pride or passion, or one lust or another in his heart, at one time or another, bolts out vain, idle, angry, and sinful words: and he that does not may be set down for a perfect man indeed: nor can he tame or restrain the tongues of others from detraction, calumnies, backbitings, and whisperings; who say, their lips are their own, and who is Lord over us? no man can, by his own power and strength, tame or subdue his tongue, or restrain it from evils it is habituated to, be it lying, cursing, swearing, or what else: God, by his Spirit, power, and grace, can, and often does, change the note of the curser, swearer, liar, and blasphemer; but no man can do this, though he can tame beasts, birds, serpents, and fishes; which shows the tongue to be worse than anything to be found in the whole compass of nature: <p>it is an unruly evil: an evil it is, for it is a world of iniquity; and an unruly one, being more so than the horse and mule, which are without understanding, who are kept in and governed, and turned any way by the bit and bridle: but though in nature the tongue is fenced by a double fence of the lips and teeth, this is not sufficient to restrain it; it breaks all bounds, and is not to be kept in by nature, art, or argument: nothing but the grace of God can in any measure govern it, or lay an embargo on it: <p>full of deadly poison, which, privately, secretly, and gradually, destroys the characters, credit, and reputation of men; and is of fatal consequence in families, neighbourhoods, churches, and states. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-8.htm" title="But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.">Jam 3:8</a>. The chief thought is marked by <span class="greekheb">δέ</span>, as a contrast to the foregoing. With <span class="greekheb">τὴν γλῶσσαν</span> is meant not the tongue of <span class="ital">others</span> (Estius, Grotius, Hornejus, Baumgarten), but one’s <span class="ital">own</span> tongue (according to Lange, both are indicated, the last primarily). The remark of Bengel is also unsuitable: nemo alius, vix ipse quisque. The words <span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς δύναται ἀνθρώπων δαμάζειν</span> (or more correctly, after B C: <span class="greekheb">οὐδεὶς δαμάσαι δύναται ἀνθρώπων</span>, because the accent is on <span class="greekheb">δαμάσαι</span>) are to be understood in all their sharpness; the weakening completion of the <span class="ital">Schol.</span> in Matthaei: <span class="greekheb">εὐκόλως δηλαδὴ καὶ ἄνευ πόνου</span>, is false.

The moral earnestness of the author urges him at the close to the exclamation: <span class="greekheb">ἀκατάστατον κακόν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.; hence the independent form of this addition (see Winer, p. 471 [E. T. 668]). By <span class="greekheb">ἀκατάστατον</span> (<span class="ital">unsteady, restless</span>, see chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">Jam 1:8</a>) the unrest of the passions is indicated, not simply with reference to what follows, <span class="ital">unsteadfastness</span> (de Wette); comp.

St James had learnt, by what he saw around him, and yet more, it may be, by personal experience, that no powers of the “nature of man” were adequate for this purpose. He had learnt also, we must believe, that the things which are impossible with man are possible with God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">an unruly evil</span>] Literally, <span class="bld">uncontrollable</span>. Many of the better MSS., however, give the adjective which is rendered “unstable” in ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-8.htm" title="A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.">James 1:8</a>, and which carries with it, together with that meaning, the idea of restlessness and turbulence.
