The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Behold also the ships - This illustration is equally striking and obvious. A ship is a large object. It seems to be unmanageable by its vastness, and it is also impelled by driving storms. Yet it is easily managed by a small rudder; and he that has control of that, has control of the ship itself. So with the tongue. It is a small member as compared with the body; in its size not unlike the rudder as compared with the ship. Yet the proper control of the tongue in respect to its influence on the whole man, is not unlike the control of the rudder in its power over the ship.<p>Which though they be so great - So great in themselves, and in comparison with the rudder. Even such bulky and unwieldy objects are controlled by a very small thing.<p>And are driven of fierce winds - By winds that would seem to leave the ship beyond control. It is probable that by the "fierce winds" here as impelling the ship, the apostle meant to illustrate the power of the passions in impelling man. Even a man under impetuous passion would be restrained, if the tongue is properly controlled, as the ship driven by the winds is by the helm.<p>Yet are they turned about with a very small helm - The ancient rudder or helm was made in the shape of an oar. This was very small when compared with the size of the vessel - about as small as the tongue is as compared with the body.<p>Whithersoever the governor listeth - As the helmsman pleases. It is entirely under his control. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4.

The feeling which moves the tongue corresponds with this.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The other similitude, in which a man is compared to a ship, the tongue to the rudder, the governing the whole body to the turning about the ship. As the rudder is but a small thing, in comparison of the much greater bulk of a ship, and yet, being itself turned, turns the whole ship (<span class="ital">though so great, and driven of so fierce winds</span>) which way soever the steersman pleaseth: so likewise the tongue, though little to the whole man, (which may withal be driven, and acted by storms of furious passions), yet if it be itself under government, the rest of the man will be so too. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/james/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Behold also the ships, which though they be so great,.... Of so large a bulk, of such a prodigious size, and are such unwieldy vessels: <p>and are driven of fierce winds; with great vehemence, rapidity, and swiftness: <p>yet are they turned about with a very small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth; the helm, or tiller of a ship, is a beam or piece of timber fastened into the rudder, and so coming forward into the steerage, where he that stands at helm steers the ship (e), who is here called the governor; or "he that directs", as the word may be rendered; that is, that steers; the word for "helm" is translated rudder in <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/27-40.htm">Acts 27:40</a>, and the helm or tiller is sometimes, though improperly, called the rudder itself (f); and this is very small, in comparison of the bulk of the ship that is guided by it (g). Aristotle calls it , "a small helm", as the apostle here does, and accounts for it how large ships should be moved and steered by it. And so, though the tongue is to the rest of the body as a small helm to a large ship, yet, like that, it has great influence over the whole body, to check it when it is carrying away with the force of its appetites and passions; and so churches, societies, and bodies of Christians, which are large and numerous, and are like ships upon the ocean, tossed to and fro with tempests, driven by Satan's temptations and the world's persecution, and ready to be carried away with the wind of false doctrine, yet are influenced and directed aright by those that are at the helm, the faithful ministers of the word, who say to them, this is the way, walk in it. <p>(e) Chambers's Cyclopedia, in the word "Helm".

The second comparison is emphatically indicated by <span class="greekheb">ἰδού</span>. <span class="greekheb">καί</span> is either <span class="ital">also</span> or <span class="ital">even so.</span> Wiesinger prefers the second meaning, which certainly gives to the thought a peculiar emphasis.

It is possible that in the second clause: <span class="greekheb">καὶ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐλαυνόμενα</span>, there is an allusion to the lusts moving man (Bede: venti validi … ipsi appetitus sunt mentium), or “to the temptations (<span class="greekheb">πειρασμοί</span>) of the world, coming from without” (Lange).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">σκληρός</span>] is also used of the wind in <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/27-16.htm" title="Whoever hides her hides the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which denudes itself.">Proverbs 27:16</a> (so also Aelian, <span class="ital">de animal</span>, v. 13, ix. 14; Dio Chrysostom, iii. p. 44 C).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The verb <span class="greekheb">μετάγεται</span> united with <span class="greekheb">τὰ πλοῖα</span> is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-3.htm" title="Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey us; and we turn about their whole body.">Jam 3:3</a>.

By the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἐλαχίστου</span> a new point is introduced which is retained in what follows.

It rather indicates, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-5.htm" title="And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them spitefully, and to stone them,">Acts 14:5</a> (see Meier <span class="ital">in loco</span>), <span class="ital">the eager will, the desire of something</span> (in Plato, <span class="ital">Phil.</span> p. 35 D, it is used as synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ἐπιθυμία</span>); thus Bede, Calvin, Grotius, Baumgarten, Gebser, de Wette, and others.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The participle <span class="greekheb">ὁ εὐθύνων</span> indicates him who sits at the helm and directs the ship; it is thus not = <span class="greekheb">ὁ εὐθυντήρ</span> (Grotius, Pott, Schneckenburger).

It will be seen that this also has its counterpart in Sophocles. The two images are brought together by a writer more within St James’s reach than the Greek tragedian.

(<span class="ital">De Conf. ling.</span> p. 336. <span class="ital">De Abr.</span> p. 360). In the latter the very word which St James uses for “governor” is employed also by Philo.
