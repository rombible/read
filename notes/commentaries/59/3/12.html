The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Can the fig-tree, my brethren, bear olive-berries? - Such a thing is impossible in nature, and equally absurd in morals. A fig-tree bears only figs; and so the tongue ought to give utterance only to one class of sentiments and emotions. These illustrations are very striking, and show the absurdity of that which the apostle reproves. At the same time, they accomplish the main purpose which he had in view, to repress the desire of becoming public teachers without suitable qualifications. They show the power of the tongue; they show what a dangerous power it is for a man to wield who has not the proper qualifications; they show that no one should put himself in the position where he may wield this power without such a degree of tried prudence, wisdom, discretion, and piety, that there shall be a moral certainty that he will use it aright. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. Transition from the mouth to the heart.<p>Can the fig tree, &c.&#8212;implying that it is an impossibility: as before in Jas 3:10 he had said it "ought not so to be." James does not, as Matthew (Mt 7:16, 17), make the question, "Do men gather figs of thistles?" His argument is, No tree "can" bring forth fruit inconsistent with its nature, as for example, the fig tree, olive berries: so if a man speaks bitterly, and afterwards speaks good words, the latter must be so only seemingly, and in hypocrisy, they cannot be real.<p>so can no fountain &#8230; salt &#8230; and fresh&#8212;The oldest authorities read, "Neither can a salt (water spring) yield fresh."

The apostle argues from what is impossible, or monstrous, in naturals, to what is absurd in manners: q.d. It is as absurd in religion, for the tongue of a regenerate man, which is used to bless God, to take a liberty at other times to curse man, as it would be strange in nature for the same tree, on the same branch, to bear fruits of different kinds; or the same fountain at the same place to send forth bitter water and sweet. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/james/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries?.... Every tree bears fruit, according to its kind; a fig tree produces figs, and an olive tree olive berries; a fig tree does not produce olive berries, or an olive tree figs; and neither of them both: <p>either a vine, figs? or fig trees, grapes; or either of them, figs and grapes: <p>so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh. The Alexandrian copy reads, "neither can the salt water yield sweet water"; that is, the sea cannot yield sweet or fresh water: the Syriac version renders it, "neither can salt water be made sweet": but naturalists say, it may be made sweet, by being strained through sand: the design of these similes is to observe how absurd a thing it is that a man should both bless and curse with his tongue. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/james/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm" title="Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.">Jam 3:12</a>. This verse shows, by examples taken from nature, that from <span class="ital">one</span> principle opposite things cannot be produced, but that any cause can only bring forth that which corresponds to its nature. Semler incorrectly paraphrases the first question: <span class="greekheb">μὴ δύναται συκῆ ἐκαίας ποιῆσαι</span>: an fieri potest, ut ficus, cujus est <span class="ital">dulcis</span> natura, producat <span class="ital">amaras</span> oleas; for that <span class="ital">here</span> the contrast of sweet and bitter (which only the last clause of the verse resumes) is not designed to be expressed, is evident from what immediately follows: <span class="greekheb">ἢ ἄμπελος σῦκα</span>, where James would otherwise have mentioned the olive instead of the vine. The idea is rather that nothing can bring forth that which is not corresponding to its nature.[179] Consequently the opinion of de Wette, that here <span class="ital">thistles</span> (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-16.htm" title="You shall know them by their fruits.

James hereby indicates, that if from <span class="ital">one</span> month the bitter (namely, the <span class="greekheb">κατάρα</span>) and also the sweet (namely, the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕὐΛΟΓΊΑ</span></span></span>) proceed, this is not only morally reprehensible, to which <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-10.htm" title="Out of the same mouth proceeds blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not so to be.">Jam 3:10</a> points, but is something <span class="ital">impossible;</span> accordingly, the person who curses man, who is made after the image of God, cannot also bless (praise) God, and that thus if the mouth yet express both, the <span class="greekheb">εὐλογεῖν</span> can only be mere seeming and hypocrisy (Lange).[181]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] Comp.

Lange correctly observes, “that the multiplying of examples has the effect of illustrating the general application of the law of life here laid down;” but he strangely supposes that “the individual examples have a symbolical meaning;” the fig-tree, the symbol of a luxurious natural life; the olives, the symbols of spiritual life, etc.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-12.htm" title="Can the fig tree, my brothers, bear olive berries? either a vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and fresh.">Jam 3:12</a>.

The Mount of Olives supplied the other feature. The idea, as a whole, is parallel to that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/matthew/7-16.htm" title="You shall know them by their fruits.

The comparison seems at first to break down, as the fact which it was meant to illustrate was that “blessing and cursing” did issue from the same mouth. What is meant, however, is that in such a case, the “blessing” loses its character, and is tainted with the bitterness of the cursing.

Its shores were lined with salt-pits, to be filled when the spring freshets should raise the waters of the lake.
