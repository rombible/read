Their fruit is hidden in the precious seed, but “the times of refreshing shall come,” and the glorious plant bring forth her flower, and bear the golden fruit for the blessed ones to eat in the fadeless paradise of God. As “whatsoever a man soweth that shall he also reap” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/6-7.htm" title="Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatever a man sows, that shall he also reap.">Galatians 6:7</a>)—here is a harvest laid up for the righteous to enjoy for ever; and (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm" title="Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.">Hebrews 12:11</a>) God’s chastening of the truly penitent yields with it a like promise afterwards of “the peaceable fruit of righteousness”—so, in the tender mercy of our Saviour, “they that sow in tears shall reap in joy” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/126-6.htm" title="He that goes forth and weeps, bearing precious seed, shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with him.">Psalm 126:6</a>).

Or, the meaning may be, they that endeavour to make peace among men, (which is a fruit or work of righteousness,) do thereby sow to themselves in peace; that is, they take that course which will produce to them happiness in the end. <a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:13-18 These verses show the difference between men's pretending to be wise, and their being really so. He who thinks well, or he who talks well, is not wise in the sense of the Scripture, if he does not live and act well. True wisdom may be know by the meekness of the spirit and temper. Those who live in malice, envy, and contention, live in confusion; and are liable to be provoked and hurried to any evil work. Such wisdom comes not down from above, but springs up from earthly principles, acts on earthly motives, and is intent on serving earthly purposes. Those who are lifted up with such wisdom, described by the apostle James, is near to the Christian love, described by the apostle Paul; and both are so described that every man may fully prove the reality of his attainments in them. It has no disguise or deceit. It cannot fall in with those managements the world counts wise, which are crafty and guileful; but it is sincere, and open, and steady, and uniform, and consistent with itself. May the purity, peace, gentleness, teachableness, and mercy shown in all our actions, and the fruits of righteousness abounding in our lives, prove that God has bestowed upon us this excellent gift.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the fruit of righteousness - That which the righteousness here referred to produces, or that which is the effect of true religion. The meaning is, that righteousness or true religion produces certain results on the life like the effects of seed sown in good ground. Righteousness or true religion as certainly produces such effects, as seed that is sown produces a harvest.<p>Is sown in peace - Is scattered over the world in a peaceful manner. That is, it is not done amidst contentions, and brawls, and strifes. The farmer sows his seed in peace. The fields are not sown amidst the tumults of a mob, or the excitements of a battle or a camp. Nothing is more calm, peaceful, quiet, and composed, than the farmer, as he walks with measured tread over his fields, scattering his seed. So it is in sowing the "seed of the kingdom," in preparing for the great harvest of righteousness in the world. It is done by men of peace; it is done in peaceful scenes, and with a peaceful spirit; it is not in the tumult of war, or amidst the hoarse brawling of a mob. In a pure and holy life; in the peaceful scenes of the sanctuary and the Sabbath; by noiseless and unobtrusive laborers, the seed is scattered over the world, and the result is seen in an abundant harvest in producing peace and order.<p>Of them that make peace - By those who desire to produce peace, or who are of a peaceful temper and disposition. They are engaged everywhere in scattering these blessed seeds of peace, contentment, and order; and the result shall be a glorious harvest for themselves and for mankind - a harvest rich and abundant on earth and in heaven. The whole effect, therefore, of religion, is to produce peace. It is all peace - peace in its origin and in its results; in the heart of the individual, and in society; on earth, and in heaven. The idea with which the apostle commenced this chapter seems to have been that such persons only should be admitted to the office of public teachers. From that, the mind naturally turned to the effect of religion in general; and he states that in the ministry and out of it; in the heart of the individual and on society at large; here and hereafter, the effect of religion is to produce peace. Its nature is peaceful as it exists in the heart, and as it is developed in the world: and wherever and however it is manifested, it is like seed sown, not amid the storms of war and the contentions of battle, but in the fields of quiet husbandry, producing in rich abundance a harvest of peace. In its origin, and in all its results, it is productive only of contentment, sincerity, goodness, and peace. Happy he who has this religion in his heart; happy he who with liberal hand scatters its blessings broadcast over the world! <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. "The peaceable fruit of righteousness." He says "righteousness"; because it is itself the true wisdom. As in the case of the earthly wisdom, after the characteristic description came its results; so in this verse, in the case of the heavenly wisdom. There the results were present; here, future.<p>fruit &#8230; sown&#8212;Compare Ps 97:11; Isa 61:3, "trees of righteousness." Anticipatory, that is, the seed whose "fruit," namely, "righteousness," shall be ultimately reaped, is now "sown in peace." "Righteousness," now in germ, when fully developed as "fruit" shall be itself the everlasting reward of the righteous. As "sowing in peace" (compare "sown in dishonor," 1Co 15:43) produces the "fruit of righteousness," so conversely "the work" and "effect of righteousness" is "peace."<p>of them that make peace&#8212;"by (implying also that it is for them, and to their good) them that work peace." They, and they alone, are "blessed." "Peacemakers," not merely they who reconcile others, but who work peace. "Cultivate peace" [Estius]. Those truly wise towards God, while peaceable and tolerant towards their neighbors, yet make it their chief concern to sow righteousness, not cloaking men's sins, but reproving them with such peaceable moderation as to be the physicians, rather than the executioners, of sinners [Calvin].   <div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the fruit of righteousness; </span> either the fruit we bring forth, which is righteousness itself, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Luke 3:8</a>,9 Ro 6:22 <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-11.htm" title="Being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are by Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.">Philippians 1:11</a></span>; or the fruit we reap, which is the reward of righteousness, viz. eternal life. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Righteousness; </span> metonymically here put for the heavenly wisdom before described, whereof it is the inseparable companion, or the effect, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-28.htm" title="And to man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.">Job 28:28</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is sown; </span> either righteousness, as the good fruit, is wrought or exercised, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-12.htm" title="Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he come and rain righteousness on you.">Hosea 10:12</a></span>, (as wickedness is said to be sown when it is acted, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/4-8.htm" title="Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow wickedness, reap the same.">Job 4:8</a></span>), or it relates to the reward, which is the fruit, of which righteousness is the seed, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/97-11.htm" title="Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright in heart.">Psalm 97:11</a></span>; and then it implies, either the sureness of that reward, that it is as certain as harvest after seed-time: or the non-enjoyment of it for the present, as they that sow their seed receive not the crop till long after. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In peace; </span> either in a mild, peaceable, amicable way; or <span class="ital">in peace</span> is as much as with peace, viz. spiritual peace and comfort of conscience. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of them that make peace; </span> that follow after and are studious of peace; and so the words may have a two-fold sense: either the meaning is: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The sower is not to be considered as God (Brückner), for from the whole context the discourse is not concerning the conduct of God, but of the Christian. The addition <span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνῃ</span> is not to be combined with <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς δικαιοσύνης</span> (Rauch) or with <span class="greekheb">δικαιοσύνης</span> (Kern: righteousness before God, which manifests itself in peace with God) as one idea, but it belongs to the verb, and announces the condition by which only the seed sown yields the fruits of righteousness; it is in antithesis to <span class="greekheb">ζῆλος καὶ ἐριθεία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-16.htm" title="For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every evil work.">Jam 3:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>De Wette incorrectly takes <span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνῃ</span> = <span class="greekheb">εἰς εἰρήνην</span>, in hope of peace.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῖς ποιοῦσιν εἰρήνην</span>] (=<span class="greekheb">εἰρηνοποιοῖς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-9.htm" title="Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.">Matthew 5:9</a>) is either the <span class="ital">Dativus actionis</span> (Wiesinger, de Wette, formerly in this commentary; Lange uncertainly) announcing who are the sowers, or <span class="ital">Dativus commodi</span> (Brückner, Bouman) announcing for whose use the <span class="greekheb">καρπὸς δικ</span>. is sown; in the latter case the <span class="greekheb">ποιοῦντες εἰρήνην</span> are likewise to be considered as sowers (de Wette considers it possible that the <span class="ital">Dativus commodi</span> may by its importance have supplanted <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τῶν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.). The latter explanation is more corresponding to the context, as it is already indicated in <span class="greekheb">ἐν εἰρήνῃ σπείρεται</span> that the sowing can only be by such as are in possession of <span class="greekheb">σοφία εἰρηνική</span>, and it was particularly brought forward that the righteousness springing from the seed is only imparted to those who make peace. Accordingly, the meaning of the sententious expression is: that the seed of righteousness sown in peace yields righteousness only to the peaceable. This explanation agrees in essentials with that of Wiesinger and Bouman, also of Lange, who, however, blends with it something foreign to it, and thinks on the future harvest of righteousness. Deviating from this, de Wette renders it: “The fruit (conduct, moral action) of righteousness is in hope of peace, as the seed of the heavenly harvest sown by them who practise peace.” Brückner: “The fruit (the produce) of righteousness is in peace dispersed (namely, by God) for them who practise peace.” Kern: “That which springs up for the peaceable as the fruit of their sowing, that is, of their peaceful conduct, is righteousness before God, which manifests itself in peace with God.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-18.htm" title="And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.">Jam 3:18</a>. The keynote of this verse is <span class="ital">peace</span>, as contrasted with the jealousy, faction and confusion mentioned above; peace and righteousness belong together, they are the result of true wisdom, the wisdom that is from above; on the other hand, strife and “every vile deed” belong together, and they are the result of the wisdom that is “earthly, <span class="greekheb">ψυχική</span>, demoniacal”.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>. <span class="ital">And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace</span> …] It is commonly said that “the fruit of righteousness” means “the fruit which is righteousness.” The analogy of a like structure, however, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-8.htm" title="Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.">Luke 3:8</a> (“worthy fruits of repentance”), <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-9.htm" title="(For the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth;)">Ephesians 5:9</a> (“the fruit of the Spirit”), and other passages, is in favour of taking it as the fruit which righteousness produces. Every good deed is a fruit produced by the good seed sown in the good soil, and not choked by thorns. And every such deed is, in its turn, as the seed of a future fruit like in kind. It is “sown in peace” (we must remember all the fulness of meaning which the Hebrew mind attached to peace as the highest form of blessedness) either “by” or “for” (the former is, perhaps, meant, but the phrase may have been used to include both) those that make peace. We cannot fail to connect these words with the beatitude on the peace-makers in the Sermon on the Mount (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-9.htm" title="Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.">Matthew 5:9</a>). We can as little fail to note the resemblance between this portraiture of the true wisdom and the picture which St Paul draws in 1 Corinthians 13 of the excellence of Charity or Love. Differing, as the two teachers did, in many ways, in their modes of thought and language, one fastening on the more practical, the other on the more spiritual, aspects of the Truth, there was an essential agreement in their standard of the highest form of the Christian character. A comparison of the two helps us to understand how the one teacher held out the right hand of fellowship to the other (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-9.htm" title="And when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we should go to the heathen, and they to the circumcision.">Galatians 2:9</a>), and to hope for a like accord now among men who seem to differ in their conception of Christian Truth, if only they agree in their ultimate aim and standard, and feel, in the depth of their being, that Love is Wisdom, and that Wisdom is Love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-18.htm" title="And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace.">Jam 3:18</a>. <span class="greekheb">Καρπὸς δὲ δικαιοσύνης ἐν εἰρήνῃ</span>, <span class="ital">but the fruit of righteousness</span> [<span class="ital">is</span>] <span class="ital">in peace</span>) So <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-11.htm" title="Now no chastening for the present seems to be joyous, but grievous: nevertheless afterward it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to them which are exercised thereby.">Hebrews 12:11</a>, note.
