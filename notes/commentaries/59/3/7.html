The apostle cannot mean that such creatures as sharks and whales have been tamed, according to the general import of that term, or made harmless and familiar with man, as some beasts, naturally savage, have been; but of which large fishes are in their nature incapable. But even they have been conquered, and brought entirely under the power of man, so that he could use them as he would. <span class="ital">But the tongue can no man tame </span>— Namely, the tongue of another; no, nor his own, without peculiar help from God.

The affairs of mankind are thrown into confusion by the tongues of men. Every age of the world, and every condition of life, private or public, affords examples of this. Hell has more to do in promoting the fire of the tongue than men generally think; and whenever men's tongues are employed in sinful ways, they are set on fire of hell. No man can tame the tongue without Divine grace and assistance. The apostle does not represent it as impossible, but as extremely difficult. Other sins decay with age, this many times gets worse; we grow more froward and fretful, as natural strength decays, and the days come on in which we have no pleasure. When other sins are tamed and subdued by the infirmities of age, the spirit often grows more tart, nature being drawn down to the dregs, and the words used become more passionate. That man's tongue confutes itself, which at one time pretends to adore the perfections of God, and to refer all things to him; and at another time condemns even good men, if they do not use the same words and expressions. True religion will not admit of contradictions: how many sins would be prevented, if men would always be consistent! Pious and edifying language is the genuine produce of a sanctified heart; and none who understand Christianity, expect to hear curses, lies, boastings, and revilings from a true believer's mouth, any more than they look for the fruit of one tree from another. But facts prove that more professors succeed in bridling their senses and appetites, than in duly restraining their tongues. Then, depending on Divine grace, let us take heed to bless and curse not; and let us aim to be consistent in our words and actions.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For every kind of beasts - The apostle proceeds to state another thing showing the power of the tongue, the fact that it is ungovernable, and that there is no power of man to keep it under control. Everything else but this has been tamed. It is unnecessary to refine on the expressions used here, by attempting to prove that it is literally true that every species of beasts, and birds, and fishes has been tamed. The apostle is to be understood as speaking in a general and popular sense, showing the remarkable power of man over those things which are by nature savage and wild. The power of man in taming wild beasts is wonderful. Indeed, it is to be remembered that nearly all those beasts which we now speak of as "domestic" animals, and which we are accustomed to see only when they are tame, were once fierce and savage races. This is the case with the horse, the ox, the ass, (see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/11-12.htm">Job 11:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/39-5.htm">Job 39:5</a>), the swine, the dog, the cat, etc. The editor of the Pictorial Bible well remarks, "There is perhaps no kind of creature, to which man has access, which might not be tamed by him with proper perseverance. The ancients seem to have made more exertions to this end, and with much better success, than ourselves. The examples given by Pliny, of creatures tamed by men, relate to elephants, lions, and tigers, among beasts; to the eagle, among birds; to asps, and other serpents; and to crocodiles, and various fishes, among the inhabitants of the water. Natural History viii. 9, 16, 17; x. 5, 44. The lion was very commonly tamed by the ancient Egyptians, and trained to assist both in hunting and in war." Notes in loc. The only animal which it has been supposed has defied the power of man to tame it, is the hyena, and even this, it is said, has been subdued, in modern times. There is a passage in Euripides which has a strong resemblance to this of James:<p>&#x392;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; &#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;<p>&#x391;&#787;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;<p>&#x394;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#837;&#834; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bb;&#x3b1; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;,<p>&#x3a7;&#x3b8;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4; &#787; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3c4;&#x3b5; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;.<p>Brachu toi sthenos aneros<p>Alla poikiliais prapido&#772;n<p>Dama phula pontou,<p>Chthonio&#772;n t' aerio&#772;n te paideumata.<p>"Small is the power which nature has given to man; but, by various acts of his superior understanding, he has subdued the tribes of the sea, the earth, and the air." Compare on this subject, the passages quoted by Pricaeus in the Critici Sacri, in loc.<p>And of birds - It is a common thing to tame birds, and even the most wild are susceptible of being tamed. A portion of the leathered race, as the hen, the goose, the duck, is thoroughly domesticated. The pigeon, the martin, the hawk, the eagle, may be; and perhaps there are none of that race which might not be made subject to the will of man.<p>And of serpents - The ancients showed great skill in this art, in reference to asps and other venomous serpents, and it is common now in India. In many instances, indeed, it is known that the fangs of the serpents are extracted; but even when this is not done, they who practice the art learn to handle them with impunity.<p>And of things in the sea - As the crocodile mentioned by Pliny. It may be affirmed with confidence that there is no animal which might not, by proper skill and perseverance, be rendered tame, or made obedient to the will of man. It is not necessary, however, to understand the apostle as affirming that literally every animal has been tamed, or ever can be. He evidently speaks in a popular sense of the great power which man undeniably has over all kinds of wild animals - over the creation beneath him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. every kind&#8212;rather, "every nature" (that is, natural disposition and characteristic power).<p>of beasts&#8212;that is, quadrupeds of every disposition; as distinguished from the three other classes of creation, "birds, creeping things (the Greek includes not merely 'serpents,' as English Version), and things in the sea."<p>is tamed, and hath been&#8212;is continually being tamed, and hath been so long ago.<p>of mankind&#8212;rather, "by the nature of man": man's characteristic power taming that of the inferior animals.

The dominion of human nature over the brute creation is expressed by the verb <span class="greekheb">δαμάζειν</span> (i.e. so to subdue, that what is subdued submits to the will of the subduer), because it supposes the subjection of something resisting (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/5-4.htm" title="Because that he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been plucked asunder by him, and the fetters broken in pieces: neither could any man tame him.">Mark 5:4</a>). That James only thought on wild animals does not follow from this. The perfect <span class="greekheb">δεδάμασται</span> is added to the present <span class="greekheb">δαμάζεται</span> in order to represent the present taming as that which had already taken place in the past.

These verses, are, of course, not to be taken literally; their exaggerative character rather reminds one of the orator carried away by his subject.

It may be noted that the Authorised Version in this instance returns to Wycliffe, who used the word in its old sense, and that all the intermediate versions give “nature.” The fourfold classification is obviously intended to be exhaustive—and “beasts” must therefore be taken in its common familiar meaning of “quadruped.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">serpents</span>] is too specific for the third word, and it would be better to give the rendering which it commonly has elsewhere, of “creeping things.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind</span>] Better, the word being the same as in the first clause, “<span class="bld">by the nature of man</span>.” The tense of the first verb implies “is <span class="bld">continually being tamed</span>.” The assertion may seem at first somewhat hyperbolical, but the well-known cases of tame rats and tame wasps, the lion of Androcles and the white fawn of Sertorius, furnish what may well be termed “crucial instances” in support of it. The story related by Cassian (<span class="ital">Coll</span>. xxiv. 2), that St John in his old age kept a tame partridge, makes it probable that St James may have seen, among his fellow-teachers, such an instance of the power of man to tame the varied forms of animal life around him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-7.htm" title="For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and of things in the sea, is tamed, and has been tamed of mankind:">Jam 3:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γαρ</span>, <span class="ital">for</span>) Nothing is more violent than fire.—<span class="greekheb">φύσις θηρίων</span>, the <span class="ital">nature of beasts</span>) A Periphrasis, for <span class="greekheb">θήρια</span>, <span class="ital">beasts</span>.—<span class="greekheb">δαμάζεται καὶ δεδάμασται</span>, <span class="ital">is tamed</span>, in a passive sense; <span class="ital">and has been tamed</span> [has suffered itself to be tamed], in a middle sense.—<span class="greekheb">τῇ φυσει</span> [in obedience] <span class="ital">to the nature of man</span>) The dative case denotes the obedience of those things which are tamed.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/james/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> <span class="accented">- Fourth illustration</span>, involving a proof of the terrible power of the tongue for evil.

With this fourfold enumeration of the brute creation ("beasts ... birds.., serpents...  things in the sea"), cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-2.htm">Genesis 9:2</a>, "The fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon all the beasts (<span class="greek">&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;</span>) of the earth, upon all the fowls (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x1f73;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;</span>) of the heavens, and upon all that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the sea." <span class="accented">Serpents</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c1;&#x3c0;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>) would be better rendered, as B.V., <span class="accented">creeping things.</span> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Kind (&#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Wrong. James is not speaking of the relation between individual men and individual beasts, but of the relation between the nature of man and that of beasts, which may be different in different beasts. Hence, as Rev., in margin, nature.<p>Beasts (&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Quadrupeds. Not beasts generally, nor wild beasts only. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-4.htm">Acts 28:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/28-5.htm">Acts 28:5</a>, the word is used of the viper which fastened on Paul's hand. In Peter's vision (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-19.htm">Acts 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/11-6.htm">Acts 11:6</a>) there is a different classification from the one here; quadrupeds being denoted by a specific term, &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;, four-footed creatures. There &#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1; includes fishes, which in this passage are classed as &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;, things in the sea.<p>By mankind (&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#837;&#834; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#837;)<p>Rather, by the nature of man, &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;, as before, denoting the generic character. Every nature of beasts is tamed by the nature of man. Compare the fine chorus in the "Antigone" of Sophocles, 343-352:<p>"The thoughtless tribe of birds,<p>The beasts that roam the fields<p>The brood in sea-depths born,<p>He takes them all in nets,<p>Knotted in snaring mesh,<p>Man, wonderful in skill.<p>And by his subtle arts<p>He holds in sway the beasts<p>continued...</body></html>
