Thus whom God had called and chosen, you refused. “It is unworthy,” observes Calvin on this passage, “to cast down those whom God lifts up, and to treat them shamefully whom He vouchsafes to honour. But God honoureth the poor; therefore whoever he is that rejects them perverts the ordinance of God.”<p><span class= "bld">Do not rich men oppress you?</span>—Or, <span class= "ital">lord it over you</span> as a class; not assuredly that this can be said of each wealthy individual.

The purse-proud litigious man is the hardest to deal with, and the one who specially will grind the faces of the poor.

St. James does not here encourage rudeness or disorder: civil respect must be paid; but never such as to influence the proceedings of Christians in disposing of the offices of the church of Christ, or in passing the censures of the church, or in any matter of religion. Questioning ourselves is of great use in every part of the holy life. Let us be more frequent in this, and in every thing take occasion to discourse with our souls. As places of worship cannot be built or maintained without expense, it may be proper that those who contribute thereto should be accommodated accordingly; but were all persons more spiritually-minded, the poor would be treated with more attention that usually is the case in worshipping congregations. A lowly state is most favourable for inward peace and for growth in holiness. God would give to all believers riches and honours of this world, if these would do them good, seeing that he has chosen them to be rich in faith, and made them heirs of his kingdom, which he promised to bestow on all who love him. Consider how often riches lead to vice and mischief, and what great reproaches are thrown upon God and religion, by men of wealth, power, and worldly greatness; and it will make this sin appear very sinful and foolish. The Scripture gives as a law, to love our neighbour as ourselves. This law is a royal law, it comes from the King of kings; and if Christians act unjustly, they are convicted by the law as transgressors. To think that our good deeds will atone for our bad deeds, plainly puts us upon looking for another atonement. According to the covenant of works, one breach of any one command brings a man under condemnation, from which no obedience, past, present, or future, can deliver him. This shows us the happiness of those that are in Christ. We may serve him without slavish fear. God's restraints are not a bondage, but our own corruptions are so. The doom passed upon impenitent sinners at last, will be judgment without mercy. But God deems it his glory and joy, to pardon and bless those who might justly be condemned at his tribunal; and his grace teaches those who partake of his mercy, to copy it in their conduct.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But ye have despised the poor - Koppe reads this as an interrogation: "Do ye despise the poor?" Perhaps it might be understood somewhat ironically: "You despise the poor, do you, and are disposed to honor the rich! Look then, and see how the rich treat you, and see whether you have so much occasion to regard them with any peculiar respect." The object of the apostle is to fix the attention on the impropriety of that partiality which many were disposed to show to the rich, by reminding them that the rich had never evinced towards them any such treatment as to lay the foundation of a claim to the honor which they were disposed to render them.<p>Do not rich men oppress you? - Referring probably to something in their conduct which existed particularly then. The meaning is not that they oppressed the poor as such, but that they oppressed those whom James addressed. It is probable that then, as since, a considerable portion of those who were Christians were in fact poor, and that this would have all the force of a personal appeal; but still the particular thought is, that it was a characteristic of the rich and the great, whom they were disposed peculiarly to honor, to oppress and crush the poor. The Greek here is very expressive: "Do they not imperiously lord it over you?" The statement here will apply with too much force to the rich in every age.<p>And draw you before the judgment-seats - That is, they are your persecutors rather than your friends. It was undoubtedly the case that many of the rich were engaged in persecuting Christians, and that on various pretences they dragged them before the judicial tribunals. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6.

Already from this opposition it is intimated that not the Christian rich, but the rich generally—not exactly only “the rich Gentiles or the Romans” (Hengstenberg)—are meant. This is also evident from what is said of them, and by which their conduct is designated as hostile to Christians (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΜῶΝ</span></span></span>) who belong to the poor.[118] <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΔΥΝΑΣΤΕΎΕΙΝ</span></span></span>] only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>, frequently in the LXX. and Apocrypha (see particularly <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-20.htm" title="Let us condemn him with a shameful death: for by his own saying he shall be respected.">Wis 2:20</a>), means “to use power <span class="ital">against</span> any to his hurt.” Related ideas are <span class="greekheb">κατακυριεύειν</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΕΞΟΥΣΙΆΖΕΙΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm" title="But Jesus called them to him, and said, You know that the princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they that are great exercise authority on them.">Matthew 20:25</a>.

There can be little doubt that it is the former which is intended here, but the idea of the latter must also have been present.—<span class="greekheb">οὐχ οἱ πλούσιοι καταδυναστεύουσιν ὑμῶν</span>: the rich here probably refer to wealthy Jews, though it does not follow that “there could have been no question of <span class="ital">rich Jews</span> if the city and the temple had fallen” (Knowling), for the Epistle was addressed to Jews of the Dispersion, the bulk of whom were not affected, as far as their worldly belongings were concerned, by the Fall of Jerusalem. On the other hand, the possibility of the reference being to rich Jewish-Christians, or Gentile-Christians, cannot be dismissed off-hand, for on the assumption of a late date for the Epistle it is more likely that these would be meant. The writer is taxing his hearers both with bad treatment accorded to the poor, as well as pusillanimity with regard to the rich. The word <span class="greekheb">καταδυν</span>. only occurs once elsewhere in the N.T., <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm" title="How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.">Acts 10:38</a>, … <span class="greekheb">πάντας τοὺς καταδυναστευομένους ὑπὸ τοῦ διαβόλου</span>; but fairly frequently in the Septuagint, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-4.htm" title="Hear this, O you that swallow up the needy, even to make the poor of the land to fail,">Amos 8:4</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/2-10.htm" title="Let us oppress the poor righteous man, let us not spare the widow, nor reverence the ancient gray hairs of the aged.">Wis 2:10</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/15-14.htm" title="And all the enemies of thy people, that hold them in subjection, are most foolish, and are more miserable than very babes.">Wis 15:14</a>. The accusative <span class="greekheb">ὑμᾶς</span>, which is the reading of <span class="greekheb">א</span>1A, etc., is in accordance with the frequent usage of the Septuagint, where <span class="greekheb">καταδυν</span>. often takes an accusative instead of the genitive.—<span class="greekheb">αὐτοὶ</span>: “The pronoun <span class="greekheb">αὐτὸς</span> is used in the nominative, not only with the meaning ‘self’ when attached to a subject, as in classical Greek, but also when itself standing for the subject, with a less amount of emphasis, which we might render ‘he for his part,’ or ‘it was he who,’ as in the next clause; it is disputed whether it does not in some cases lose its emphatic force altogether, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-2.htm" title="And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus, which was the chief among the publicans, and he was rich.">Luke 19:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-31.htm" title="And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight.">Luke 24:31</a>” (Mayor). <span class="greekheb">ἕλκουσιν</span>: See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-7.htm" title="And as you go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand.">Matthew 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-18.htm" title="And you shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.">Matthew 10:18</a>. <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm" title="And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and drew them into the marketplace to the rulers,">Acts 16:19</a>, … <span class="greekheb">ἐπιλαβόμενοι τὸν Παῦλον καὶ τὸν Σίλαν εἵλκυσαν εἰς τὴν ἀγορὰν ἐπὶ τοὺς ἄρχοντας</span>.—<span class="greekheb">κριτήρια</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-2.htm" title="Do you not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm" title="If then you have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>, either Jewish (<span class="ital">cf.</span> the Peshiṭtâ rendering <span class="greekheb">בית דינא</span>) tribunals or Gentile ones.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/james/2.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">6</span>. <span class="ital">But ye have despised the poor</span>] Better, <span class="bld">ye have dishonoured</span>, or <span class="bld">done dishonour to</span>, the word implying the outward act that expressed contempt.

As a rule the wealthier class in Judæa tended to Sadduceeism (Joseph. <span class="ital">Ant.</span> xiii. 10. § 6), and St James’s reference to their treatment of the disciples agrees with the part that sect took, including, as it did, the aristocracy of the priesthood, in the persecutions of the earlier chapters of the Acts (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-1.htm" title="From where come wars and fights among you? come they not hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?">James 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/4-6.htm" title="But he gives more grace.

In the Greek the verb is preceded by an emphatic pronoun, “Is it not <span class="ital">they</span> that drag you.” There seems, at first, a want of logical coherence. The rich man first appears as gaining undue prominence in the assembly of Christians, and then as one of a class of persecutors and blasphemers. This, however, is just the point on which St James lays stress. Men honoured the rich Christian, not because he was a Christian, but because he was rich, i. e. because he was connected with a class, which, as such, had shewn itself bitterly hostile to them.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-6.htm" title="But you have despised the poor.

So Saul thought that he ought to do many things contrary to the <span class="accented">Name</span> of Jesus of Nazareth, and strove to make them blaspheme (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-9.htm">Acts 26:9-11</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> All this they did <span class="accented">in person</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b1;&#x1f50;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f77;</span>); "themselves," just as Saul did. No difficulty need be felt about the presence of these rich men in the synagogues of the Christians (see Introduction, p. 8.). It will be noticed that St. James <span class="accented">never</span> calls them "<span class="accented">brethren."</span> Further, it must be remembered that, at this early date, the Church had not yet learnt by bitter experience the need for that secrecy with which in later days she shrouded her worship. At this time the Christian assemblies were open to any who chose to find their way in. All were welcome, as we see from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/14-23.htm">1 Corinthians 14:23</a>, etc., where the chance entry of "<span class="accented">men</span> unlearned or unbelieving" is contemplated as likely to happen. Hence there is no sort of difficulty in the presence of the "rich man" here, who might be eagerly welcomed, and repay his welcome by dragging them to the judgment-seat. <span class="cmt_word">Draw you before the judgment-seats.</span> The account given by Josephus of the death of St, James himself affords a good illustration of the manner in which Christians were liable to this (see Introduction, p. 6.). But the tribunals need not be confined to Jewish ones. Other instances of similar treatment, illustrating the thoughts and language of the passage before us, may be found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-19.htm">Acts 16:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-6.htm">Acts 17:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/18-12.htm">Acts 18:12</a>. Litigation of an entirely different character between Christians themselves is alluded to and condemned by St. Paul in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6.htm">1 Corinthians 6</a>. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Despised (&#x3b7;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;)<p>Not strong enough. They had manifested their contempt; had done despite to them. Rev., correctly, dishonored. From the use of the aorist tense, ye dishonored, which the A. V. and Rev. render as a perfect, ye have dishonored, the reference would appear to be to a specific act like that described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-2.htm">James 2:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm">James 2:3</a>.<p>Oppress (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-38.htm">Acts 10:38</a>. The preposition &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#769;, against, implies a power exercised for harm. Compare being lords over, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-3.htm">1 Peter 5:3</a>, and exercise dominion, <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/20-25.htm">Matthew 20:25</a>, both compounded with this preposition.<p>Draw (&#x3b5;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;)<p>Not strong enough. The word implies violence. Hence, better, as Rev., drag. Compare Livy's phrase, "a lictoribus trahi, to be dragged by the lictors to judgment;" <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/8-3.htm">Acts 8:3</a>, of Saul haling or hauling men and women to prison; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-58.htm">Luke 12:58</a>.<p>Judgment-seats (&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;)<p>Only here and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-2.htm">1 Corinthians 6:2</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/6-4.htm">1 Corinthians 6:4</a>. </body></html>
