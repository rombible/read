There are two passages in the Old Testament in which an analogous designation is applied to the patriarch, but probably the name was one in current use amongst the people, and expressed in a summary fashion the impression that had been made by the history of Abraham’s life. A sweet fate to have that as the brief record of a character, and to be known throughout the ages by such an epitaph. As many of us are aware, this name, ‘the Friend,’ has displaced the proper name, Abraham, on the Lips of all Mohammedan people to this day; and the city of Hebron, where his corpse lies, is commonly known simply as ‘the Friend.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘My object in this sermon is a very simple one. I merely wish to bring out two or three of the salient elements and characteristics of friendship as exercised on the human level, and to use these as a standard and test of our religion and relation to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But I may just notice, for a moment, how beautiful and blessed a thought it is which underlies this and similar representations of Scripture - viz., that the bond which unites us to God is the very same as that which most sweetly and strongly ties men to one another, and that, after all, religion is nothing more or less than the transference to Him of the emotions which make all the sweetness of human life and society.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Now, I shall try to bring out two or three points which are included in that name, ‘the Friend of God,’ and to ask ourselves if they apply to our relations to Him.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">I. First, friends trust and love one another.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Mutual confidence is the mortar which binds the stones in society together, into a building. It makes the difference between the herding together of beasts and the association of men. No community could keep together for an hour without mutual confidence, even in regard of the least intimate relationships of life. But it is the very life-blood of friendship. You cannot say, ‘A.B. is my friend, but I do not trust him.’ If suspicion creeps in, like the foul malaria of tropical swamps, it kills all friendship. Therefore ‘he was called the Friend of God’ is by James deduced from the fact that ‘he believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness.’ You cannot make a friend of a man that you do not know where to have. There may be some vague reverence of, or abject reluctant submission to, ‘the unknown God,’ the something outside of ourselves that perhaps makes for righteousness; but for any vivid, warm throb of friendship there must be, first, a clear knowledge, and then a living grappling of that knowledge to my very heart, by my faith. Unless I trust God I cannot be a friend of God’s. If you and I are His friends we trust Him, and He will trust us. For this friendship is not one-sided, and the name, though it may be ambiguous as to whether it means one whom I love or one who loves me, really includes both persons to the compact; and there are analogous, if not identical, emotions in each. So that, if I trust God, I may be sure that God trusts me, and, in His confidence, leaves a great deal to me; and so ennobles and glorifies me by His reliance upon me.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But whilst we know that this belief in God was the very nerve and centre of Abraham’s whole character, and was the reason why he was called the friend of God, we must also remember that, as James insists upon here, it was no mere idle assent, no mere intellectual conviction that God could not tell lies, which was dignified by the name of belief, but that it was, as James insists upon in the context, a trust which proved itself to be valid, because it was continually operative in the life. ‘Faith without works is dead.’ ‘And Abraham, our father, was he not justified by works?’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And so the Epistle to the Hebrews, if you will remember, traces up to his faith all the chief points in his life. ‘By faith he went out from the land where he dwelt; by faith he dwelt in tabernacles,’ in the promised land, believing that it should be his and his seed’s; ‘by faith’ he offered up his son on the altar.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Thus we come to this, that the heavenly and the earthly friend, like friends on the low levels of humanity, love each other because they trust each other, I have said that the words ‘My friend’ may either mean one whom I love or one who loves me, but that the two things are in the present connection inseparable. Only let us remember where the sweet reciprocation and interchange of love begins. ‘We love Him because He first loved us.’ ‘When we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son.’ And so we have to turn to that heavenly Friend, and feel that as life itself, so the love which is the life of life, has its beginning in Him, and that never would our hearts have turned themselves from their alienation, unless there had poured down upon them the attractive outflow of His great love. It was an old fancy that, wherever a tree was struck by lightning, all its tremulous foliage turned in the direction from which the bolt had come. When the merciful flash of God’s great love strikes a heart, then all its tendrils turn to the source of the life-giving light, and we love back again, in sweet reverberation to the primal and original love. Dear brethren, I lay upon your heart and mine this thought, that friends trust and love each other. Do we trust and love our God?<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">II. Friends have frank, familiar intercourse with one another.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us turn to the illuminatlve example in our text, and remember God’s frankness with Abraham. ‘Shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I will do?’ Let us cap that-as we can, marvellous and great as the utterance is - by another one, ‘I call you not servants, but friends; for all things that I have heard of My Father I declare unto you.’ So much for God’s frankness. What about Abraham’s frankness with God? Remember how he remonstrated with Him; how he complained to Him of His dealings; how he persisted with importunity, which would have been presumptuous but for the friendship which underlay it, and warranted the bold words. And let us take the simple lesson that if we are friends and lovers of God, we shall delight in intercourse with Him. It is a strange kind of religion that does not care to be with God, that would rather think about anything else than about Him, that is all unused to quiet, solitary conversation and communion with Him, but it is the religion of, I wonder, how many of us to-day. He would be a strange friend that never crossed your threshold if you could help it; that was evidently uncomfortable in your presence, and ill at ease till he got away from you, and that when he came was struck dumb, and had not a word to say for himself, and did not know or feel that he and you had any interests or subjects in common. Is that not a good deal like the religion of hosts of professing Christians? ‘He was called the friend of God,’ and he never, all his days, if he could help it, thought about Him or went near Him!<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we are friends of God, we shall have no secrets from Him. There are very few of those who are dearest to us to whom we could venture to lay bare all the depths of our hearts. There are black things down in the cellars that we do not like to show to any of our friends. We receive them upstairs, in the rooms for company. But you should take God all through<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>the house. And if there is the trust and the love that l have been speaking about, we shall not be afraid to spread out all our foulness, and our meanness, and our unworthy thoughts of, and acts towards, Him, before His ‘pure eyes and perfect judgment,’ and say, ‘Nobody but my best friend could look at such a dungheap, but I spread it before Thee. Look at it, and Thou wilt cleanse it; look at it, and it will melt away. Look at it, and in the knowledge that Thou knowest, my knowledge of it will be less of a torment, and my bosom will be cleansed of its perilous stuff.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Tell God all, if you mean to be a friend of His. And do not be afraid to tell Him your harsh thoughts of Him, and your complaints of Him. He never resents anything that a man who loves Him says about Him, if he says it to Him. What He resents - if I might use the word - is our huddling up grudges and murmurings and questionings in our own hearts, and saying never a word to the friend against whom they offend. Out with it all, brethren! Complaints, regrets, questionings, petitions, hot wishes, take them all to Him; and be sure that instead of their breaking, they will, if spoken, cement the friendship which is disturbed by secrecy on our parts.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we are God’s lovers, He will have no secrets from us. ‘The secret of the Lord is with them that fear Him; and He will show them His covenant.’ There is a strange wisdom and insight, sometimes amounting even to prophetic anticipation, which creeps into a simple heart that is knit closely to God. But whether the result of our friendship with Him be such communication of such kinds of insight or no, we may be sure of this, that, if we trust Him, and love Him, and are frank with Him, He will in so far be frank with us, that He will impart unto us Himself, and in the knowledge of His love we shall find all the knowledge that we need.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">III. Friends delight to meet each other’s wishes.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us go back to our story again. The humble, earthly friend of God did as God bade him, substantially all his life, from the day when he made the ‘ Great Refusal,’ and left behind him home and kindred and all, until the day when he went up the sides of Moriah to offer there his son. Abraham met God’s wishes because Abraham trusted and loved God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And what about the Divine Friend? Did He not meet Abraham’s wishes? You remember that wonderful scene, which presents, in such vivid and dramatic form, the everlasting truth that the man who bows his will to God, bows God’s will to his, when he pleaded for Sodom, and won his case by persistence and importunity of lowly prayer. And these historical notices on both sides are for us the vehicles of the permanent truth that, if we are God’s lovers and friends, we shall find nothing sweeter than bowing to His will and executing His commandments. As I dare say I have often said to you, the very mark and signature of love is that it delights to divine and fulfil the desires of the beloved, and that it moulds the will of each of the parties into conformity with the will of the other.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ah, dear brethren I what a commentary our religion is. upon such thoughts! To how many of us is the very notion of religion that of a prohibition of things that we would much like to do, and of commands to do things that we had much rather not do? All the slavery of abject submission, of reluctant service, is clean swept away, when we understand that friendship and love find their supreme delight in discovering and in executing the will of the beloved. And surely if you and I are the friends of God, the cold words, ‘duty,’ ‘must,’ ‘should,’ will be struck out of our vocabulary and will be replaced by ‘delight,’ ‘cannot but; ‘will.’ For friends find the very life - I was going to say the voice-of their friendship in mutual obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>And God, the heavenly Friend, will do what we wish. In that very connection did Jesus Christ put the two thoughts of friendship with Him and His executing His disciple’s behests; saying in one breath, ‘Ye are My friends if ye do whatsoever I command you,’ and in the next, ‘Ye shall ask what ye will, and it shall be done unto you.’ This conformity of will, so that there is but one will in, the two hearts, which is the very consummation and superlative degree of human friendship and love, applies as truly to the friendship between man and God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">IV. Friends give gifts to each other.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Let us go back to our story. What did Abraham give God? ‘Forasmuch as he hath not withheld his only son from Me, I know that he fears Me.’ And what does God give to His friends? ‘He that spared not His own Son, but freely delivered Him up to the death for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?’ Abraham’s gift of his son to God was but a feeble shadow of God’s gift of His Son to men. And if the surrender on the part of the human friend was the infallible token of his love, surely the surrender on the part of the heavenly Friend is no less the infallible sign of His love to all the world. Generalise these thoughts and they come to this.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we are God’s lovers God will give us Himself, in so far as we can receive Him; and all other gifts in so far as they are good and needful. If we are God’s friends and lovers we shall give Him, in glad surrender, our whole selves. And, remember, if you feel that you have separate interests from Him, if you keep things and do not let Him say, ‘These are mine’; if you grudge sacrifice, and will not hear of self-surrender, and are living lives centred in, ruled by, devoted to, self, you have little reason to call yourself a Christian. ‘Ye are My friends if ye’ - not only ‘do whatsoever I command you,’ but ‘if you give yourself to Me.’ Yield yourselves to God, and in the giving of yourselves to Him, you will get back yourselves glorified and blessed by the gift. There is no friendship if self shuts out the friend from participation in what is the other’s. As long as ‘mine’ lies on this side of a high wall, and ‘thine’ on the other, there is but little friendship. Down with the wall, and say about everything ‘Ours’; and then you have a right to say ‘I am the friend of God.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">V. Lastly, and but a word. Friends stand up for each other.</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘I am thy shield; fear not, Abraham,’ said God, when His friend was in danger from the vengeance of the Eastern kings whom he had defeated; and all through life the same strong arm was cast around him. Abraham, on his part, had to stand up for God amidst his heathen neighbours.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>If we are God’s ‘friends and lovers He will take up our cause. Be sure that if God be for us, it matters not who is against us. If we are God’s friends and lovers we have to take up His cause. What would you think of a man who, in going away to a far-off country, said to some friend, ‘I wish you would look after so and so for me as long as I am gone’; and the friend would say ‘Yes!’ and never give a thought nor lift a finger to discharge the obligation? God trusts His reputation to you Christian people; He has interests in this world that you have to look after. You have to defend Him as really as He has to defend you. And it is the dreadful contradiction of religious people’s profession of religion that they often care so little, and do so little to promote the cause, to defend the name, to adorn the reputation, and to further what I may venture to call the interests, of their heavenly Friend in the world.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Dear brother, looking at these things, can you venture to say that you are a friend of God? If you cannot, what are you? Our relations to men admit of our dividing them into three - friends, enemies, nothings. We may love, we may hate, we may be absolutely indifferent and ignorant. I am afraid the<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>three states cannot be transferred exactly to our relations to God. If not His friend, what are you? Have you only a far-off, bowing acquaintance with Him? Well, then, that is because you have neglected, if you have not spurned, His offered friendship. And, oh! how much you have lost! No human heart is a millionth part so sweet, and so capable of satisfying you as God’s. All friendship here has its limits, its changes, its end. God’s is boundless, immutable, eternal All things are the friends of God’s friend; and all things are arrayed against him who rejects God’s friendship.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>I beseech you, let Him woo you to love Him; and yield your hearts to Him. ‘If when we were "enemies," we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son,’ much more, being friends, all the fulness of His love and the sweetness of His heart will be poured upon us through the living Christ.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/james/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God....">James 2:23-24</a></span>. <span class="ital">And the scripture </span>— Which was afterward written, <span class="ital">was </span>hereby eminently <span class="ital">fulfilled.

So pleasing to God were the works he wrought in faith! “The passage of Scripture which St. James here says was fulfilled, contains two assertions: 1st, That Abraham believed God; 2d, That his believing God was counted to him for righteousness. By the offering of Isaac that scripture was confirmed or proved to be true in both its parts. For, 1st, By offering Isaac, in the firm expectation that God would raise him from the dead, and fulfil in him the promise of the numerous seed, Abraham showed that he believed God in the firmest manner. 2d, By offering Isaac, Abraham had the promise, that God would count his faith to him for righteousness, renewed and confirmed in a solemn manner with an oath.” — Macknight. <span class="ital">Ye see then </span>— By this instance of the great father of the faithful, (for the characters of the children are to be estimated in the same manner as those of the father,) <span class="ital">that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only </span>— It is by no means sufficient, in order to our salvation, that the great principles of religion be credited, if they have not their practical influence on the heart and life.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/james/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:14-26 Those are wrong who put a mere notional belief of the gospel for the whole of evangelical religion, as many now do. No doubt, true faith alone, whereby men have part in Christ's righteousness, atonement, and grace, saves their souls; but it produces holy fruits, and is shown to be real by its effect on their works; while mere assent to any form of doctrine, or mere historical belief of any facts, wholly differs from this saving faith. A bare profession may gain the good opinion of pious people; and it may procure, in some cases, worldly good things; but what profit will it be, for any to gain the whole world, and to lose their souls? Can this faith save him? All things should be accounted profitable or unprofitable to us, as they tend to forward or hinder the salvation of our souls. This place of Scripture plainly shows that an opinion, or assent to the gospel, without works, is not faith. There is no way to show we really believe in Christ, but by being diligent in good works, from gospel motives, and for gospel purposes. Men may boast to others, and be conceited of that which they really have not. There is not only to be assent in faith, but consent; not only an assent to the truth of the word, but a consent to take Christ. True believing is not an act of the understanding only, but a work of the whole heart. That a justifying faith cannot be without works, is shown from two examples, Abraham and Rahab. Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Faith, producing such works, advanced him to peculiar favours. We see then, ver. 24, how that by works a man is justified, not by a bare opinion or profession, or believing without obeying; but by having such faith as produces good works. And to have to deny his own reason, affections, and interests, is an action fit to try a believer. Observe here, the wonderful power of faith in changing sinners. Rahab's conduct proved her faith to be living, or having power; it showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by an assent of the understanding. Let us then take heed, for the best works, without faith, are dead; they want root and principle. By faith any thing we do is really good; as done in obedience to God, and aiming at his acceptance: the root is as though it were dead, when there is no fruit. Faith is the root, good works are the fruits; and we must see to it that we have both. This is the grace of God wherein we stand, and we should stand to it. There is no middle state. Every one must either live God's friend, or God's enemy. Living to God, as it is the consequence of faith, which justifies and will save, obliges us to do nothing against him, but every thing for him and to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And the Scripture was fulfilled which saith - That is, the fair and full meaning of the language of Scripture was expressed by this act, showing in the highest sense that his faith was genuine; or the declaration that he truly believed, was confirmed or established by this act. His faith was shown to be genuine; and the fair meaning of the declaration that he believed God was carried out in the subsequent act. The passage here referred to occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a>. That which it is said Abraham believed, or in which he believed God, was this: "This shall not be thine heir (namely, Eliezer of Damascus), but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels, shall be thine heir." And again, "Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them. And he said unto him, So shall thy seed be," <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-3.htm">James 2:3-5</a>. The act of confiding in these promises, was that act of which it is said that "he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness."<p>The act of offering his son on the altar by which James says this Scripture was fulfilled, occurred some 20 years afterward. That act confirmed or fulfilled the declaration. It showed that his faith was genuine, and that the declaration that he believed in God was true; for what could do more to confirm that, than a readiness to offer his own son at the command of God? It cannot be supposed that James meant to say that Abraham was justified by works without respect to faith, or to deny that the primary round of his justification in the sight of God was faith, for the very passage which he quotes shows that faith was the primary consideration: "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed," etc. The meaning, therefore, can only be, that this declaration received its fair and full expression when Abraham, by an act of obedience of the most striking character, long after he first exercised that faith by which he was accepted of God, showed that his faith was genuine. It he had not thus obeyed, his faith would have been inoperative and of no value. As it was, his act showed that the declaration of the Scripture that, he "believed" was well founded.<p>Abraham believed God, and it was imputed ... - See this passage fully explained in the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a>.<p>And he was called the friend of God - In virtue of his strong faith and obedience. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; "Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed of Abraham thy friend forever?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm">Isaiah 41:8</a>. "But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend." This was a most honorable appellation; but it is one which, in all cases, will result from true faith and obedience. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>23. scripture was fulfilled&#8212;Ge 15:6, quoted by Paul, as realized in Abraham's justification by faith; but by James, as realized subsequently in Abraham's work of offering Isaac, which, he says, justified him. Plainly, then, James must mean by works the same thing as Paul means by faith, only that he speaks of faith at its manifested development, whereas Paul speaks of it in its germ. Abraham's offering of Isaac was not a mere act of obedience, but an act of faith. Isaac was the subject of the promises of God, that in him Abraham's seed should be called. The same God calls on Abraham to slay the subject of His own promise, when as yet there was no seed in whom those predictions could be realized. Hence James' saying that Abraham was justified by such a work, is equivalent to saying, as Paul does, that he was justified by faith itself; for it was in fact faith expressed in action, as in other cases saving faith is expressed in words. So Paul states as the mean of salvation faith expressed. The "Scripture" would not be "fulfilled," as James says it was, but contradicted by any interpretation which makes man's works justify him before God: for that Scripture makes no mention of works at all, but says that Abraham's belief was counted to him for righteousness. God, in the first instance, "justifies the ungodly" through faith; subsequently the believer is justified before the world as righteous through faith manifested in words and works (compare Mt 25:35-37, "the righteous," Mt 25:40). The best authorities read, "But Abraham believed," &c.<p>and he was called the Friend of God&#8212;He was not so called in his lifetime, though he was so even then from the time of his justification; but he was called so, being recognized as such by all on the ground of his works of faith. "He was the friend (in an active sense), the lover of God, in reference to his works; and (in a passive sense) loved by God in reference to his justification by works. Both senses are united in Joh 15:14, 15" [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">And the Scripture was fulfilled; </span> this illustrious instance of Abraham’s obedience did so clearly evidence the sincerity of his faith, that it did most plainly appear, that what the Scripture said of him, it spoke most truly, viz. that he did indeed believe God, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">and it was counted to him for righteousness.</span> Things are said to be fulfilled when they are most clearly manifested.

See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-3.htm">Romans 4:3</a> which shows both that Abraham was justified before he wrought this work, and therefore that could not be the cause or matter of his justification, but only an effect and evidence of it;

But in this explanation of the word <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> there is an arbitrary weakening of the idea. <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> signifies neither in the N.

Evidently in what he had already said, namely, that Abraham <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη</span>, and which he indicates by what follows: <span class="greekheb">καὶ φίλος Θεοῦ ἐκλήθη</span>; for these words—since they belong not to the scripture—are co-ordinate not with <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐλογίσθη</span>, but with <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐπληρώθη κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. It is true God regarded Abraham as His <span class="greekheb">φίλος</span> (<span class="greekheb">φίλος Θεοῦ</span> is not, as Hofmann and Philippi think, God’s friend, who loved God, but God’s friend whom God loved[153]) the instant he reckoned his faith to him for righteousness; but he was <span class="ital">called</span> so at a later period, namely, only at the time that he was <span class="ital">declared</span> righteous by God on account of his <span class="ital">works.</span> The expressions <span class="greekheb">ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικαιοσύνην</span> and <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΙΚΑΙΏΘΗ</span></span></span> are not regarded by James as equivalent, but according to his representation the former was imparted to Abraham <span class="ital">purely</span> on account of his faith (<span class="greekheb">ἐπίστευσεν</span>), but the <span class="ital">latter</span> only when his faith was completed by works, thus on account of his works (<span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span>), so that thereby that scripture was fulfilled. It is true this scripture is abstractly no promise; but as it notifies facts which point to later actions in which they received their full accomplishment, James might consider it as a word of promise which was fulfilled by the occurrence of these later actions.[154]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The appellation of Abraham as a <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΦΊΛΟς ΘΕΟῦ</span></span></span> is not indeed found in the LXX.; but in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm" title="Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>, Jehoshaphat calls him in his prayer <span class="greekheb">אֹֽהַבְךָ</span> (LXX.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὁ ἨΓΑΠΗΜΈΝΟς ΣΟΥ</span></span></span>), and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a> God Himself calls him <span class="greekheb">אֹֽהֲבִי</span> (LXX.: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὋΝ ἨΓΆΠΗΣΑ</span></span></span>); comp. also Ges.

It is evident from what has preceded that we cannot, with Grotius, Hornejus, Pott, and others, explain <span class="greekheb">ἐκλήθη</span> = factus est, fuit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[153] Lange comprehends both; but at all events, according to the context, the reference given above is to be recognised as the prevailing one.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[154] Namely: the faith with which Abraham received the promise of God points to the later obedience, and the divine reckoning of his faith for righteousness points to the declaration of righteousness imparted to him by God at a later period after proof of his obedience.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>REMARK.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>When de Wette explains <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> by <span class="ital">realized</span>, this is so far inappropriate, as <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> does not directly refer to the fact itself, but to the saying of scripture, and as neither of <span class="greekheb">πιστεύειν</span> of Abraham, nor of <span class="greekheb">ἑλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικ</span>., can it be said that it “was something not yet wholly real, but the full realization of which occurred only at a later period.” For although both point to a later period, yet there was in them something which had actually taken place, as Lange correctly adduces. Hofmann also gave an incorrect reference to the word, explaining it: “In the offering of Isaac it was proved that God had rightly estimated the faith of Abraham when He counted it for righteousness;” for, on the one hand, there was no need of a proof that God had rightly estimated something, of which there is no indication in James, and, on the other hand, <span class="greekheb">πληροῦν</span> has not the meaning of confirming or proving.[155] In opposition to the explanation of Philippi: “the scriptural expression concerning Abraham’s justification by faith was, because His justification by faith is in itself a thing invisible as it were, an unfulfilled prophecy, until it became visible through proof by works,” it is, apart, from the unjustifiable insertion of “<span class="ital">as it were</span>,” to be observed that Abraham’s act of obedience, happening at a later period, confirmed indeed his faith (thus that <span class="greekheb">ἐπίστευσεν τῷ Θεῷ</span>), but not the righteousness adjudged to him on account of his faith (that <span class="greekheb">ἐλογίσθη αὐτῷ εἰς δικ</span>.), and accordingly <span class="greekheb">ἐπληρώθη</span> would be suitable only for the first half of the scriptural expression. It is peculiar that, according to the explanation of Philippi, the same meaning: “to be proved,” is in essence ascribed to the three words<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">τελειοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">πληροῦσθαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[155] Also in Brückner’s explanation: “Both the fact that Abraham believed God, and that this faith was reckoned to him by God for righteousness, was confirmed and proved in the offering of Isaac, leading to this that Abraham <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη</span>,” the idea <span class="greekheb">τληροῦν</span> receives not its right meaning. Lange has here in essentials adopted the correct meaning.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">Jam 2:23</a>. There is some little looseness in the way the O.T. is used in these verses; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a> mention is made of the <span class="ital">work</span> of offering up Isaac, whereby, it is said (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm" title="See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?">Jam 2:22</a>), faith is perfected; then it goes straight on (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">Jam 2:23</a>) to say that the Scripture was fulfilled which saith, “Abraham believed …”; this reads as though the quotation were intended to refer to the offering up of Isaac,—the proof of perfected faith; but as a matter of fact the quotation refers to Abraham’s belief in Jehovah’s promise to the effect that the seed of Abraham was to be as numerous as the stars of heaven. In the O.T., that is to say, there is no connection between the quotation from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a> and the offering-up of Isaac. This manipulation of Scripture is strongly characteristic of Jewish methods of exegesis.—<span class="greekheb">ἐπίστευσεν δὲ Ἀβραὰμ</span> …: the N.T. = Septuagint, which differs from the Hebrew in reading <span class="greekheb">τῷ Θεῷ</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τῷ κυρίῳ</span>, and the passive <span class="greekheb">ἐλογίσθη</span> for the active. Faith, according to Jewish teaching, was a good deed which was bound to bring its reward; it was one of those things which <span class="ital">demanded</span> a reward; the phrase <span class="greekheb">זכות אמונה</span> (“the merit of faith, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, “trustfulness”) occurs in <span class="ital">Beresh. Rabba</span>, chap. 74, where it is parallel to <span class="greekheb">זכות תורה</span> (“the merit of [keeping] the Law”); merit, that is to say, is <span class="ital">acquired</span> by trusting God, just as merit is <span class="ital">acquired</span> by observing the precepts of the <span class="ital">Torah</span>; the man who has acquired sufficient merit is in a state of <span class="ital">Zecûth, i.e.</span>, in that state of righteousness, attained by good works, wherein he is in a position to <span class="ital">claim</span> his reward from God. Very pointed, in this connection, are the reiterated words of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-5.htm" title="And when you pray, you shall not be as the hypocrites are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-16.htm" title="Moreover when you fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may appear to men to fast. Truly I say to you, They have their reward.">Matthew 6:16</a>, “Verily, I say unto you, they have received their reward”.—<span class="greekheb">φίλος θεοῦ</span>: <span class="ital">Cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm" title="Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>; Dan. 3:35 (Septuagint); in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/6-17.htm" title="Whoso feareth the Lord shall direct his friendship aright: for as he is, so shall his neighbour be also.">Sir 6:17</a> the Septuagint reads: <span class="greekheb">ὁ φοβοίμενος Κύριον εὐθύνει φιλίαν αὐτοῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι κατʼ αὐτὸν οὕτως καὶ ὁ πλησίον αὐτοῦ</span>; the Hebrew has: “For as He Himself is, so is His friend, and as is His name, so are his works” (“works” must refer, most likely, to the “friend,” not to God); the Syriac runs: “They that fear God show genuine friendship, for as He Himself is, so are His friends, and as is His name, so are His works”. In the <span class="ital">Book of Jubilees</span>, xix. 9, it says in reference to Abraham; “For he was found faithful (believing), and was written down upon the heavenly tablets as the friend of God”; this is repeated in xxx. 20, but from what is said in the next verse it is clear that all those who keep the covenant can be inscribed as “friends” upon these tablets. Deissmann (<span class="ital">Bibelstudien</span>, pp. 159 f.) points out that at the court of the Ptolemies <span class="greekheb">φίλος</span> was the title of honour of the highest of the royal officials. In <span class="ital"><a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/7-27.htm" title="And being but one, she can do all things: and remaining in herself, she maketh all things new: and in all ages entering into holy souls, she maketh them friends of God, and prophets.">Wis 7:27</a></span> the “friends of God” is an expression for the “righteous”. The phrase <span class="greekheb">φίλος Θεοῦ</span>, therefore, while in the first instance probably general in its application, became restricted, so that finally, as among the Arabs, “the friend of God,” <span class="ital">Khalil Allah</span>, or simply <span class="ital">El Khalil</span>, became synonymous with Abraham. Irenæus, iv. 16, iv. 34, 4, refers to Abraham as “the friend of God,” but he does not mention our Epistle; if a reference to this was intended it is the earliest trace of an acquaintance with it. See, further, an interesting note of Nestle’s in the <span class="ital">Expository Times</span>, xv. pp. 46 f.; <span class="ital">cf.</span> <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-17.htm" title="And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do;">Genesis 18:17</a> where the Septuagint reads, <span class="greekheb">οὐ μὴ κρύψω ἀπὸ Ἀβραὰμ τοῦ παιδός μου ἃ ἐγὼ ποιῶ</span>, which is quoted by Philo with <span class="greekheb">τοῦ φίλου μου</span> instead of <span class="greekheb">τοῦ π</span>. <span class="greekheb">μου</span>.

Singularly enough, however, the term is not found in the Hebrew, nor in the LXX. version, with which St James, writing in Greek, must have been familiar, and which gives, in the first of the two passages, “Abraham thy beloved,” and in the second, “whom I loved.” The distinctive title first appears in Philo’s citation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-1.htm" title="And the LORD appeared to him in the plains of Mamre: and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;">Genesis 18:1</a> (<span class="ital">De resipisc.

Abraham had already been the <span class="ital">friend</span> of God, before his death; and after his death he was so called by his posterity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/20-7.htm" title="Are not you our God, who did drive out the inhabitants of this land before your people Israel, and gave it to the seed of Abraham your friend for ever?">2 Chronicles 20:7</a>; and by God Himself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-8.htm" title="But you, Israel, are my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham my friend.">Isaiah 41:8</a>. He was the <span class="ital">friend</span>, in an active sense, <span class="ital">the lover of God</span>, which has a reference to works; and in a passive sense, <span class="ital">loved by God</span>, which has a reference to justification by works. Both these senses, united together by the force of the relatives, are found also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/15-14.htm" title="You are my friends, if you do whatever I command you.">John 15:14</a>. In Hebrew it is <span class="greekheb">אהב</span>, which, in the passages cited, has an active sound, but a passive signification. At least the parallel words in Isaiah are, <span class="ital">servant, elect</span>, and <span class="ital">friend</span>; and in the Septuagint, <span class="greekheb">ὃ ἠγάπησα</span>, <span class="ital">whom I loved</span>, as in the passage quoted from 2 Chron. it is <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Τῷ ἨΓΑΠΗΜΈΝῼ ΣΟΥ</span></span></span>, <span class="ital">beloved by Thee</span>. On which place also the Halle reviewers[29] remark, that Abraham is called by the Arabs as it were by a proper name, <span class="ital">Alchalil</span>, that is, the friend of God. So also <a href="http://apocrypha.org/judith/8-22.htm" title="And the slaughter of our brethren, and the captivity of the country, and the desolation of our inheritance, will he turn upon our heads among the Gentiles, wheresoever we shall be in bondage; and we shall be an offence and a reproach to all them that possess us.">Jdt 8:22</a>, <span class="ital">Abraham amicus Dei effectus est</span>, though these words are not found in the Greek text.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[28] See, under the title AMPLIATIO, Append.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[29] Halle reviewers. The reference is to the “Memoirs of a Library at Halle,” a periodical publication under the superintendence of Baumgarten, printed in the years 1748–1751. It contains valuable information on the various editions of the New Testament. See Michaelis’ Introduction by Bp.

The same title, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x1fe6;</span>, is given to Abraham by Clement of Rome ('Ad Corinthians,' 10; 17.), and was evidently a standing one among the Jews.

Illustrations from later rabbinical writers may be found in Wetstein, and cf. Bishop Lightfoot on 'Clement of Rome,' p. 61. To this day it is said that Abraham is known among the Arabs as <span class="accented">El Khalil</span>, equivalent to "the Friend." <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/james/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Was fulfilled (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>Not was confirmed, which the word does not mean either in New-Testament or in classical usage, but was actually and fully realized.
