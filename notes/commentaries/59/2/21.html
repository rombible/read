No doubt, true faith alone, whereby men have part in Christ's righteousness, atonement, and grace, saves their souls; but it produces holy fruits, and is shown to be real by its effect on their works; while mere assent to any form of doctrine, or mere historical belief of any facts, wholly differs from this saving faith. A bare profession may gain the good opinion of pious people; and it may procure, in some cases, worldly good things; but what profit will it be, for any to gain the whole world, and to lose their souls? Can this faith save him? All things should be accounted profitable or unprofitable to us, as they tend to forward or hinder the salvation of our souls. This place of Scripture plainly shows that an opinion, or assent to the gospel, without works, is not faith. There is no way to show we really believe in Christ, but by being diligent in good works, from gospel motives, and for gospel purposes. Men may boast to others, and be conceited of that which they really have not. There is not only to be assent in faith, but consent; not only an assent to the truth of the word, but a consent to take Christ. True believing is not an act of the understanding only, but a work of the whole heart. That a justifying faith cannot be without works, is shown from two examples, Abraham and Rahab. Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness. Faith, producing such works, advanced him to peculiar favours. We see then, ver. 24, how that by works a man is justified, not by a bare opinion or profession, or believing without obeying; but by having such faith as produces good works. And to have to deny his own reason, affections, and interests, is an action fit to try a believer. Observe here, the wonderful power of faith in changing sinners. Rahab's conduct proved her faith to be living, or having power; it showed that she believed with her heart, not merely by an assent of the understanding. Let us then take heed, for the best works, without faith, are dead; they want root and principle. By faith any thing we do is really good; as done in obedience to God, and aiming at his acceptance: the root is as though it were dead, when there is no fruit. Faith is the root, good works are the fruits; and we must see to it that we have both. This is the grace of God wherein we stand, and we should stand to it. There is no middle state. Every one must either live God's friend, or God's enemy. Living to God, as it is the consequence of faith, which justifies and will save, obliges us to do nothing against him, but every thing for him and to him.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/james/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Was not Abraham our father - Our progenitor, our ancestor; using the word "father," as frequently occurs in the Bible, to denote a remote ancestor. Compare the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-1.htm">Matthew 1:1</a>. A reference to his case would have great weight with those who were Jews by birth, and probably most of those to whom this Epistle was addressed were of this character. See the Introduction.<p>Justified by works - That is, in the sense in which James is maintaining that a man professing religion is to be justified by his works. He does not affirm that the ground of acceptance with God is that we keep the law, or are perfect; or that our good works make an atonement for our sins, and that it is on their account that we are pardoned; nor does he deny that it is necessary that a man should believe in order to be saved. In this sense he does not deny that men are justified by faith; and thus he does not contradict the doctrine of the apostle Paul. But he does teach that where there are no good works, or where there is not a holy life, there is no true religion; that that faith which is not productive of good works is of no value; that if a man has that faith only, it would be impossible that he could be regarded as justified, or could be saved and that consequently, in that large sense, a man is justified by his works that is, they are the evidence that he is a justified man, or is regarded and treated as righteous by his Maker. The point on which the apostle has his eye is the nature of saving faith; and his design is to show that a mere faith which would produce no more effect than that of the demons did, could not save.<p>In this he states no doctrine which contradicts that of Paul. The evidence to which he appeals in regard to faith, is good works and a holy life; and where that exists it shows that the faith is genuine. The case of Abraham is one directly in point. He showed that he had that kind of faith which was not dead. He gave the most affecting evidence that his faith was of such a kind as to lead him to implicit obedience, and to painful sacrifices. Such an act as that referred to - the act of offering up his son - demonstrated, if anything could, that his faith was genuine, and that his religion was deep and pure. In the sight of heaven and earth it would justify him as a righteous man, or would prove that he was a righteous man. In regard to the strength of his faith, and the nature of his obedience in this sacrifice, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-19.htm">Hebrews 11:19</a>. That the apostle here cannot refer to the act of justification as the term is commonly understood, referring by that to the moment when he was accepted of God as a righteous man, is clear from the fact that in a passage of the Scriptures which he himself quotes, that is declared to be consequent on his believing: "Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness."<p>The act here referred to occurred long subsequent to that, and was thus a fulfillment or confirmation of the declaration of Scripture, which says that "he believed God." It showed that his faith was not merely speculative, but was an active principle, leading to holy living. See the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm">James 2:23</a>. This demonstrates that what the apostle refers to here is the evidence by which it is shown that a man's faith is genuine, and that he does not refer to the question whether the act of justification, where a sinner is converted, is solely in consequence of believing. Thus the case proves what James purposes to prove, that the faith which justifies is only that which leads to good works.<p>When he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar - This was long after he believed, and was an act which, if any could, would show that his faith was genuine and sincere. On the meaning of this passage, see the notes at <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/11-17.htm">Hebrews 11:17</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/james/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>21. Abraham &#8230; justified by works&#8212;evidentially, and before men (see on [2605]Jas 2:18). In Jas 2:23, James, like Paul, recognizes the Scripture truth, that it was his faith that was counted to Abraham for righteousness in his justification before God.<p>when he had offered&#8212;rather, "when he offered" [Alford], that is, brought as an offering at the altar; not implying that he actually offered him.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/james/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Was not Abraham our father; </span> not only the father of us as Jews, (for to them he wrote), and according to the flesh, but as believers, and according to the promise; so all believers are called Abraham’s children, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-11.htm" title="And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised: that he might be the father of all them that believe, though they be not circumcised; that righteousness might be imputed to them also:">Romans 4:11</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/3-7.htm" title="Know you therefore that they which are of faith, the same are the children of Abraham.">Galatians 3:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Justified by works; </span> found or declared to be justified, not only before God, but in the face of the world; and his faith (by which he had been justified above thirty years before in the sight of God) now approved as a true, lively, justifying faith, by this proof he gave of it, upon God’s trying him in the offering up his son, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-9.htm" title="And they came to the place which God had told him of; and Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar on the wood.">Genesis 22:9</a>,12</span>, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Now I know that thou fearest God, </span>& c.

So that Abraham’s justification here was not the absolution of a sinner; but the solemn approbation of a believer; not a justifying him as ungodly, but commending him for his godliness. He was by his works justified as a righteous person, but not made righteous, or constituted in a justified state, by his works. The design of the apostle is not to show how sinners are justified in God’s court, but only what kind of faith it is whereby they are justified, viz. such a one as purifies the heart, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/15-9.htm" title="And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.">Acts 15:9</a></span>, and looks to Christ, not only as made righteousness, but sanctification to them, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-30.htm" title="But of him are you in Christ Jesus, who of God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:">1 Corinthians 1:30</a></span>; and consequently not only rests on him for justification, but stirs them up to yield obedience to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When he had offered Isaac his son; </span> viz. in his firm purpose and resolution, and was about to do it actually, had not God hindered him.

Not as the causes of his justification, that is denied, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-2.htm">Romans 4:2</a> but as effects of it, showing the truth of his faith, and the reality of his justification: he had both faith and works, and the former were known by the latter; and even the faith which he had expressed years ago was manifested, demonstrated, and confirmed to be true and genuine, by the instance of his obedience to God, here produced; by which it appeared he was a true believer, a justified person, approved of God, and loved by him. Now if this was the case of Abraham, the father of the Jewish nation, yea, the father of the faithful, of all that believe, he is, and must be a vain man, that talks of faith without works; and his faith must be a dead one, and he be very unlike the father of them that believe: the good work instanced in is the offering up of Isaac; <p>when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar: for when he was bid to take his son, his only and beloved son, Isaac, and offer him up on one of the mountains, that should be shown him, he made haste to do it; he provided everything for it; he split the wood, and carried it with him, and fire in his hand; he built an altar, laid the wood on it, bound his son, laid the wood on the altar, and his son on the wood, and stretched out his hand, with his knife in it, to slay him; so that it was all one, with respect to his intention and will, as if he had actually offered him, and was a full trial and proof of his obedience to God. This was not the only act of obedience, or good work, which he performed; but this being a very eminent one, the apostle instances in it, as a very considerable evidence of his faith in God, and love to him; and which showed him to be a justified person, as he was long before he performed this action, even before Isaac was born; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm">Genesis 15:6</a> and therefore it can never be the apostle's meaning, that he was justified before God by this, or any other good work or works, as cause or causes of it; but only that he was declared to be so; or, in other words, that his faith was attended with good works, and evidenced by them. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/james/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Was not Abraham our father <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span><p>(k) Was he not by his works known and found to be justified?

The testimony to which James first appeals is what happened to Abraham. The reference to Abraham is completely explained from his historical importance, and which is also indicated by <span class="greekheb">ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡμῶν</span>] because both James and his readers belonged to the nation of Israel sprung from Abraham. By the question with <span class="greekheb">οὐ</span> the thought is characterized as such to which all—thus all the opponents—must assent: <span class="ital">Was not Abraham our father justified by works?</span> The participial sentence which follows declares what works procured for him justification: <span class="ital">when he offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span><span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The reference to the doctrine of the Apostle Paul, and especially to his declaration in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a> ff., has misled expositors into many arbitrary explanations of this verse, and particularly of the word <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span>. In order to have a sure foundation for interpretation, two things are to be examined,—(1) the context, and (2) the linguistic usage. (1) As regards the context, the question treated in this whole section is, How the Christian is saved;[142] comp. the question in <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">Jam 2:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">μὴ δύναται ἡ πίστις σῶσαι αὐτόν</span>; and the connection of that section with the preceding, where the discourse is about the divine judgment (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-12.htm" title="So speak you, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the law of liberty.">Jam 2:12</a> : <span class="greekheb">κρίνεσθαι</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-13.htm" title="For he shall have judgment without mercy, that has showed no mercy; and mercy rejoices against judgment.">Jam 2:13</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἡ κρίσις</span>). As James appeals to Abraham for his assertion that faith <span class="ital">without works</span> cannot save, it is evident that by <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span> he cannot mean something which happened to Abraham from himself, but only something which happened to him from God; so that the meaning cannot be, “Abraham justified himself by his works,” but only that “God justified him on the ground of his works.”[143] (2) As regards the linguistic usage, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> corresponds to the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">הַצְדִּיק</span>, which, as a <span class="ital">judicial</span> term, has the meaning: <span class="ital">to declare one</span> <span class="greekheb">צַדִּיק</span> <span class="ital">by an acquittal from guilt</span>, and is opposed to <span class="greekheb">הַרְשִׁיעַ</span> (LXX.: <span class="greekheb">καταγινώσκειν</span>, <span class="greekheb">καταδικάζειν</span>) = to declare one <span class="greekheb">רָשָׁע</span> by a sentence of condemnation; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-7.htm" title="Keep you far from a false matter; and the innocent and righteous slay you not: for I will not justify the wicked.">Exodus 23:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-1.htm" title="If there be a controversy between men, and they come to judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.">Deuteronomy 25:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-32.htm" title="Then hear you in heaven, and do, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked, to bring his way on his head; and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his righteousness.">1 Kings 8:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-23.htm" title="Then hear you from heaven, and do, and judge your servants, by requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way on his own head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according to his righteousness.">2 Chronicles 6:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/17-15.htm" title="He that justifies the wicked, and he that comdemns the just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.">Proverbs 17:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-23.htm" title="Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!">Isaiah 5:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/50-8.htm" title="He is near that justifies me; who will contend with me? let us stand together: who is my adversary? let him come near to me.">Isaiah 50:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/53-11.htm" title="He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities.">Isaiah 53:11</a>; in the Apocrypha, comp. <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/10-29.htm" title="Who will justify him that sinneth against his own soul? and who will honour him that dishonoureth his own life?">Sir 10:29</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/13-22.htm" title="When a rich man is fallen, he hath many helpers: he speaketh things not to be spoken, and yet men justify him: the poor man slipped, and yet they rebuked him too; he spake wisely, and could have no place.">Sir 13:22</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-11.htm" title="A man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin, he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.">Sir 23:11</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/34-5.htm" title="Divinations, and soothsayings, and dreams, are vain: and the heart fancieth, as a woman's heart in travail.">Sir 34:5</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/42-2.htm" title="Of reckoning with thy partners and travellers; or of the gift of the heritage of friends;">Sir 42:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> has also the same meaning in the N. T., where, especially (besides the passages treating of the Pauline doctrine of justification), <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-13.htm" title="(For not the hearers of the law are just before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified.">Romans 2:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-14.htm" title="I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other: for every one that exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted.">Luke 18:14</a> are to be compared. This judicial meaning of the word is here to be retained. It is true, as <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> (similarly the English word “to justify”) occurs not only in the judicial sense, but, also more generally, as also <span class="greekheb">הַצְדִּיק</span>, in the sense “set forth as righteous”[144] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-29.htm" title="And all the people that heard him, and the publicans, justified God, being baptized with the baptism of John.">Luke 7:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>), the passage has been explained: “Abraham has been proved righteous,” or, “has proved himself righteous” (so already Calvin, and, in recent times, Philippi). But this explanation is unsuitable, since, according to this view, justification did not happen to Abraham from God (as must be conceived according to the context), but from his works; thus it was Abraham who justified himself by his works, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> proved himself to be righteous.[145] If we hold fast to the judicial meaning, then it is to be observed that, in the conception of the word, <span class="ital">neither anything about the disposition of him who is the object of the declaration of righteousness, nor about the ground of justification</span> (whether it rests in the judge or in the conduct of him who is justified), is indicated. For this reason the explanation of Wiesinger: a Deo justus agnitus, is incorrect, as the idea of a <span class="ital">ratifying recognition</span> of the already existing condition is not contained in the word. As little is it to be vindicated when Hofmann thinks that <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span> here imports: “to become a <span class="greekheb">δίκαιος</span>, inasmuch as he then answered to the will of God relating to him;” for, on the one hand, by this a meaning (namely, being made a righteous person) is ascribed to the word which it has not; and, on the other hand, no one can make himself a righteous person by his works, but only can prove himself to be such.[146] James says nothing else than that Abraham <span class="ital">was declared righteous</span> (by God) <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span>. By <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span> the reason is specified, on Abraham’s part, on account of which a declaration of righteousness was granted to him. By these works are to be understood not <span class="ital">all</span> the works which Abraham has done, nor his whole pious life, but, as the clause <span class="greekheb">ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαὰκ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. shows, <span class="ital">the actual offering of his son Isaac on the altar.</span> The plural <span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων</span> is used because the category, at first entirely general, is specified which here comes into consideration. It may appear surprising that James here should emphasize precisely that offering as the reason of the declaration of righteousness, since in the O. T. narrative (Genesis 22.) a <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span> of Abraham is not mentioned. What James has in view is not “the judgment of God there; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-12.htm" title="And he said, Lay not your hand on the lad, neither do you any thing to him: for now I know that you fear God, seeing you have not withheld your son, your only son from me.">Genesis 22:12</a> comp. with <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm" title="And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?">Jam 2:16</a> ff.” (Wiesinger); for in these words, which, moreover, only serve as an introduction to the declaration which follows, nothing is addressed to Abraham, but only it is testified of him that God in his action has recognised his fear of God. Not in this, but only in what God addresses to him on account of it, because He has recognised him as a God-fearing man, can James have found the declaration of Abraham’s righteousness. This is the bestowal of the promise (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/james/2-16.htm" title="And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?...">Jam 2:16-18</a>) by which it is expressly said, “<span class="ital">because</span> thou hast <span class="ital">done</span> this thing” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-16.htm" title="And one of you say to them, Depart in peace, be you warmed and filled; notwithstanding you give them not those things which are needful to the body; what does it profit?">Jam 2:16</a>), and “<span class="ital">because</span> thou hast <span class="ital">obeyed</span> my voice” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-18.htm" title="Yes, a man may say, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.">Jam 2:18</a>); by which is definitely brought forward that the promise was granted on account of his obedience—that is, on account of his works. What importance, with regard to the promise, the obedience of Abraham had in the eyes of God is clearly brought out from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/26-5.htm" title="Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws.">Genesis 26:5</a>, where God ratifies this same promise with Isaac in these words: “<span class="ital">Because that</span> Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my charge, my commandments, my statutes, and my laws;” and not less is it to be observed when it is said in <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/44-20.htm" title="Therefore he assured him by an oath, that he would bless the nations in his seed, and that he would multiply him as the dust of the earth, and exalt his seed as the stars, and cause them to inherit from sea to sea, and from the river unto the utmost part of the land.">Sir 44:20</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὃς συνετήρησεν νόμον ὑψίστου</span> … <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἐν πειρασμῷ εὑρέθη πιστός</span>· <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο ἐν ὅρκῳ ἔστησεν αὐτῷ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. It is true that the same promise was made to Abraham at an earlier period, and that before he had done anything (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/12-2.htm" title="And I will make of you a great nation, and I will bless you, and make your name great; and you shall be a blessing:...">Genesis 12:2-3</a>); but the difference is, that after the offering of his son it was imparted to him as an <span class="ital">inalienable blessing on account of this action</span>, and that <span class="ital">at the close of his theocratic historical life.</span> In this James could rightly recognise a formal declaration of Abraham’s righteousness on the part of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>On the construction <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη ἐκ</span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐκ τῶν λόγων σου δικαιωθήσῃ</span>, where the <span class="greekheb">λόγοι</span> are reckoned as that on the ground of which acquittal (or condemnation) takes place.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The words: <span class="greekheb">ἀνενέγκας</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἐπὶ τὸ θυσιαστήριον</span>] are not, with Luther, to be translated: “when he had sacrificed his son upon the altar;” for <span class="greekheb">ἀναφέρειν</span> joined with <span class="greekheb">ἐπί</span>, with the accusative, is not to <span class="ital">sacrifice</span>, but to <span class="ital">bring as a sacrifice to the altar</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-24.htm" title="Who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live to righteousness: by whose stripes you were healed.">1 Peter 2:24</a>); it is therefore incorrect to supply the idea <span class="ital">will</span> (Estius: cum obtulisset = offere voluisset).

But James designates the faith of his opponents as <span class="greekheb">νεκρά</span>, not merely because it has no works, but because it cannot effect the <span class="greekheb">σωτηρία</span> which they expected from it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[143] Correctly, Wiesinger: “In <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη</span> the passive sense is decidedly to be retained, and, indeed, a Deo …; not of the human judgment is the discourse here and in ver. 23, but of the divine; as it treats of the proposition in ver. 14, that only an active faith can save.” This is the more to be maintained, as the thought, that faith has to justify itself <span class="ital">before men</span> as living, is so void of importance that James could not lay such stress upon it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[144] This is the prevailing meaning of הַצְדִּיק, which is differently modified according to the different circumstances to which it is referred. It is chiefly used of a judicial sentence, whether of God or of a human judge, by which one is declared צַדִּיק; yet it also occurs in another reference, namely, of every agency which causes one to appear as righteous, whether that agency is exercised by the person in question or by others. The N. T. <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> corresponds to this usage. Strictly taken, it is accordingly not correct to translate <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> by “proved to be righteous,” or “approved to be righteous,” as the ideas proving and approving, according to their proper and strict meaning, are not contained in it. Comp., however, the excellent treatment of the word in Cremer’s dictionary.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[145] Philippi explains the words: Abraham was justified <span class="ital">before men</span> by works, <span class="ital">as a justified man before God by faith.</span> But here there are evidently introduced into the idea <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span> a series of more precise statements which are not contained in it. The explanation of Brückner is simpler, who considers <span class="greekheb">ἑδικαιώθη</span> to indicate: “that moral righteousness which displays itself on the ground of the activity of faith;” but also this interpretation is not to be considered correct for the reasons above stated. The unsuitableness of this and similar interpretations is particularly evident from ver. 24. It is also to be observed, that in these explanations the passive is converted into the middle voice. In the O. T., it is true, the hithpael of צָדַק is translated in the LXX. by the preterite passive of <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/44-16.htm" title="And Judah said, What shall we say to my lord? what shall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God has found out the iniquity of your servants: behold, we are my lord's servants, both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.">Genesis 44:16</a>); but in the N. T. the passive of this verb never occurs in this meaning; the middle import is here rather expressed by the active with the reflex pronoun; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-29.htm" title="But he, willing to justify himself, said to Jesus, And who is my neighbor?">Luke 10:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-15.htm" title="And he said to them, You are they which justify yourselves before men; but God knows your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God.">Luke 16:15</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[146] The following explanations are also incorrect: “he was loved as a righteous man” (Grotius); “he was made a partaker of the favour of God and of all the blessings springing from it” (Theile); “his justification was ratified by man” (Baumgarten). The translation: “he was pardoned” (Pott), is inaccurate, because the idea of pardon always supposes a crime, which <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span> does not. Also the explanation of Lange is arbitrary: <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span>, in the N. T. deeper sense, denotes that “God declares righteousness <span class="ital">in the theocratical forum before the theocratical congregation conceived as permanent;</span>” for how can the precise statement be contained in the simple verbal idea, <span class="ital">before whom</span> the declaration of righteousness was made?<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/james/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν</span>: A stereotyped phrase in Jewish literature.—<span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη</span>: the writer is referring to the well-known Jewish doctrine of <span class="greekheb">זכות</span> (<span class="ital">Zecûth</span>), on this subject see Introduction IV., § 2.—<span class="greekheb">ἀνενέγκας Ἰσαὰκ</span> …: on this subject an example of Jewish haggadic treatment may be of interest: “When Abraham finally held the knife over his beloved son, Isaac seemed doomed, and the angels of heaven shed tears which fell upon Isaac’s eyes, causing him blindness in later life.

It is interesting to notice that even in the Talmud (e.g., <span class="ital">Ta‘anir</span>, 4<span class="ital">a</span>) the attempted sacrifice of Isaac is regarded also from a very different point of view, such words as those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/19-5.htm" title="They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind:">Jeremiah 19:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/6-7.htm" title="Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?">Micah 6:7</a>, being explained as referring to this event (see further <span class="ital">Proceedings of the Soc. of Bibl.

He presses the fact that “Abraham believed God,” and that this “was counted to him for righteousness,” i. e. that he was justified prior to any act but that of simple trust. And the impression left by a careful study of the passage referred to is that St Paul is there referring to something that had been urged, as having a high authority, against his teaching that a man is justified by faith. It is clear, at all events, that no inference can be drawn from the two passages in favour of the assumption that the Epistle of St James was later than that of St Paul to the Romans.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The use of the word “justify” shews that its meaning is to “acquit” or “count as righteous” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-37.htm" title="For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.">Matthew 12:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-39.htm" title="And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses.">Acts 13:39</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/26-29.htm" title="A merchant shall hardly keep himself from doing wrong; and an huckster shall not be freed from sin.">Sir 26:29</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/ecclesiasticus/23-11.htm" title="A man that useth much swearing shall be filled with iniquity, and the plague shall never depart from his house: if he shall offend, his sin shall be upon him: and if he acknowledge not his sin, he maketh a double offence: and if he swear in vain, he shall not be innocent, but his house shall be full of calamities.">Sir 23:11</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The preposition used in the Greek points to “works” as being the source rather than the instrument of justification.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">when he had offered Isaac his son upon the altar?</span>] Better, <span class="bld">when he offered Isaac</span>, the two acts being thought of, not as successive, but simultaneous.

It is hardly likely that the latter could have been known to St James, the internal evidence pointing to a later date; but the former, whether, as some have supposed, by the same author as the Epistle to the Hebrews, or written fifty or sixty years earlier, might well have come under his notice. In relation to St Paul’s teaching, as noticed above, it must be remembered that the one writer speaks of the beginning of Abraham’s course, the other of its consummation. St James might well urge that if Abraham had not shewn his faith by his works, up to the crowning work of the sacrifice of his son, it would have proved that his faith too was dead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/james/2.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-21.htm" title="Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had offered Isaac his son on the altar?">Jam 2:21</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἀβραὰμ ὁ πατὴρ ἡμῶν</span>, <span class="ital">Abraham our father</span>) So St Paul, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-1.htm" title="What shall we say then that Abraham our father, as pertaining to the flesh, has found?">Romans 4:1</a>.—<span class="greekheb">ἐξ ἔργων ἐδικαιώθη</span>, <span class="ital">was justified by works</span>) St James recognises the inward and peculiar power of faith, which is previous to works, and distinct from works and from their influence, which reacts upon faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-22.htm" title="See you how faith worked with his works, and by works was faith made perfect?">Jam 2:22</a>): but hypocrites are ignorant of this; speaking more readily in flattering terms of works, of which they themselves are destitute. Therefore James employs an argument <span class="ital">ad hominem</span>; and that he may convince them, he especially mentions works, while in mentioning them, he understands (as lying underneath the works) the active principle of faith. Nor does James use the word <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦσθαι</span>, <span class="ital">to be justified</span>, in a different sense from that in which St Paul uses it; in which sense <span class="ital">righteousness</span> is most intimately connected with salvation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-14.htm" title="What does it profit, my brothers, though a man say he has faith, and have not works? can faith save him?">Jam 2:14</a>. But that sense is a very pregnant one; so that the term <span class="ital">righteousness</span> is co-extensive in its meaning on the opposite side with <span class="ital">sin</span> (see especially the note, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-20.htm" title="Therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight: for by the law is the knowledge of sin.">Romans 3:20</a>); and as sin includes both <span class="ital">guilt</span> (reatus) and the <span class="ital">taint</span> (vitium) of our nature, so does <span class="ital">righteousness</span> denote the whole process, by which a man is <span class="ital">righteous</span>, and is judged and pronounced to he so; that is, one with whom God is no longer angry on account of his guilt, but reconciled to him: and one who on his part is no longer an enemy to God, but a <span class="ital">friend</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-23.htm" title="And the scripture was fulfilled which said, Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God.">Jam 2:23</a>.

Now both St James and St Paul use this word, <span class="greekheb">δικαιοῦν</span>, <span class="ital">to justify</span>, in one and the same sense, though St Paul in a more restricted, and St James in a wider application; and for this reason, that St Paul is accustomed to speak of the act of justification, which chiefly consists in the remission of sins; whereas St James, which is especially to be observed, speaks of the state resulting from the same justification (which is incorrectly but frequently termed a second justification), when a man continues in the righteousness which is of faith, and makes progress in that which is of works. Hence it is that St Paul, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-6.htm" title="And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for righteousness.">Genesis 15:6</a>, brings forward Abraham as believing; St James, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-10.htm" title="And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to slay his son.">Genesis 22:10</a>, as even offering his son upon the altar, long afterwards. The former simply adduces the saying, <span class="ital">It was counted to him</span>; the latter also this, <span class="ital">He was called friend</span>, which was afterwards added. The former says, <span class="ital">God justifies</span>, and <span class="ital">justifies the ungodly</span>, and we <span class="ital">are justified</span>; the latter simply says, <span class="ital">A man is justified</span>.
