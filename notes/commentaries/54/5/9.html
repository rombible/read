He would lay down some special rules here to be observed by his friend and disciple. What, now, is this organisation commended to Timothy in these special directions? Here, and here only in the New Testament, do we find it alluded to; but the instructions in this passage are so definite, so precise, that it is impossible not to assume in the days of Timothy and of Paul, in some, if not in all the great churches, the existence of an official band of workers, consisting of widows, most carefully selected from the congregation of believers, of a somewhat advanced age, and specially distinguished for devotion—possessing, each of these, a high and stainless reputation—they were an official band of workers, a distinct order, so to speak; for these widows, formally entered on the Church’s list, could not possibly represent those poor and desolate widows, friendless and destitute, spoken of above. The minimum age of sixty years would also exclude many; and the advice of St. Paul to the younger ones to marry again could never have been addressed to women wanting even many years of the requisite “sixty.” Were <span class= "ital">these</span> poor souls to be formally shut out from receiving the Church’s alms? Again, those on the list could never be the same persons whom we hear of as deaconesses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>, and in the Christian literature of the second century). The active duties of the office would have been utterly incompatible with the age of sixty, the minimum age at which <span class= "ital">these</span> were to be entered on the list. We then conclude these “widows” were a distinct and most honourable order, whose duties, <span class= "ital">presbyteral</span> rather than <span class= "ital">diaconic, </span>apparently consisted in the exercise of superintendence over, and in the ministry of counsel and consolation to, the younger women.—That they sat unveiled in the assemblies in a separate place by the presbyters; that they received a special ordination by laying on of hands; that they wore a peculiar dress—were distinctions probably belonging to a later age.<p><span class= "bld">Having been the wife of one man.</span>—Of the conditions of enrolment in this “order,” the first—that of age—has been alluded to; the second—“having been the wife of one man”—must not be understood in the strictly literal sense of the words. It is inconceivable that the hope of forming one of the highly honoured band of presbyteral women depended on the chance of the husband living until the wife had reached the age of sixty years. Had he died in her youth, or comparative youth, the Apostle’s will was that the widow should marry again. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1Timothy 5:14</a>, where St. Paul writes, “I will that the younger women marry,” &c.)<p>The right interpretation of the words is found in some such paraphrase as, “If in her married life she had been found faithful and true.” The fatal facility of divorce and the lax state of morality in Pagan society, especially in the Greek and Asiac cities, must be taken into account when we seek to illustrate and explain these directions respecting early Christian foundations.<p>While unhesitatingly adopting the above interpretation of the words “wife of one man,” as faithfully representing the mind of St. Paul, who was legislating here, it must be remembered, for the masses of believers whose lot was cast in the busy world (see his direct command in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1Timothy 5:14</a> of this chapter, where the family life is pressed on the younger widow, and not the higher life of solitude and self-denial), still those expositors who adopt the stricter and sterner interpretation of “wife of one man”—viz., “a woman that has had <span class= "ital">only one husband”</span>—have, it must be granted, a strong argument in their favour from the known honour the <span class= "ital">univircæ</span> obtained in the Roman world. So Dido, in <span class= "ital">Æn.</span> iv. 28, says—<p>“Ille meos, primus qui me sibi junxit, amores<p>Abstulit, ille habeat secum, servetque sepulcher.”<p>Compare, too, the examples of the wives of Lucan, Drusus, and Pompey, who, on the death of their husbands, devoted the remainder of their lives to retirement and to the memory of the dead. The title <span class= "ital">univiræ</span> graved on certain Roman tombs shows how this devotion was practised and esteemed. “To love a wife when living is a pleasure, to love her when dead is an act of religion,” wrote Statius—<p>“Uxorem vivam amare voluptas<p>Defunctam religio.”<p>—Statius, <span class= "ital">Sylv.</span> v., <span class= "ital">in Proæmio.</span><p>And see, for other instances, Lecky, <span class= "ital">Hist. of European Morals, </span>chap. 5.<p>But it seems highly improbable that the delicate and touching feeling, which had taken root certainly in some (alas! in only a small number) of the nobler Roman minds, influenced St. Paul, who, under the direction of the Holy Spirit, was laying down rules for a great and world-wide society, which was to include the many, not the few, chosen souls—was legislating for the masses, to whom such an expressed wish would indeed be “a counsel of perfection” rarely to be carried out; and so, without hesitation, we adopt the more practical interpretation given above.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man....">1 Timothy 5:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let not a widow be taken into the number </span>— <span class="greekheb">Καταλεγεσθω</span>, <span class="ital">taken upon the list </span>of those who are to be maintained by the church, and to attend upon the sick poor, and teach the young; <span class="ital">under threescore years old </span>— It might, on many accounts, and for very obvious reasons, be proper that this office should be committed only to persons of an advanced age, and such as laid aside all thoughts of marrying again. <span class="ital">Having been </span>— Neither a harlot nor a concubine; but <span class="ital">the wife of one man</span> — At a time; or having chastely confined herself to one husband while in the married relation, and not divorced him and married another.

For since these women had spent the prime of their life in the laborious offices of love mentioned by the apostle, without receiving any recompense but maintenance, it was highly reasonable, when grown old in that good service, to promote them to an honourable function, which required knowledge and experience rather than bodily strength, and which was rewarded with a liberal maintenance.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let not a widow be taken into the number - Margin, "chosen." The margin expresses the sense of the Greek more accurately, but the meaning is not materially different. Paul does not here specify into what "number" the widow is to be "taken," or for what purpose she is to be "chosen," but he speaks of this as a thing that was well understood. There can be no doubt, however, what he means. In the Acts of the <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/1.htm">Acts 1</a> Timothy <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm">Acts 6:1</a> we have this account: "And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a complaining of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration." "It appears that from the first formation of the Christian church, provision was made out of the public funds of the society for the indigent widows who belonged to it;" see Patey's Horae Paulinae on 1 Tim. o. 11. To this, as to a well-known practice, Paul here evidently refers. The manner in which he refers to it is such as to show that the custom had an existence. All that was necessary in the case, was, not to speak of it as if it were a new arrangement, but to mention those who ought to be re garded as proper subjects of the charity. It would seem, also, that it was understood that such widows, according to their ability, should exercise a proper watch over the younger females of the church. In this way, while they were supported by the church, they might render themselves useful.<p>Under threescore years old - For such reasons as those mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm">1 Timothy 5:11-14</a>.<p>Having been the wife of one man - There has been much diversity of opinion whether this means that she had never had but one husband, or whether she had been the wife of but one man at a time; that is, whether she had cast off one and married another; see Whitby, in loc. The same difficulty has been felt in regard to this as on the passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>; see the notes on that verse. Doddridge, Clarke, and others, suppose that it means, "who had lived in conjugal fidelity to her husband." The reason assigned for this opinion by Doddridge, is, that the apostle did not mean to condemn second marriages, since he expressly <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a> commends it in the younger widows. The correct interpretation probably is, to refer it to one who had been married but once, and who, after her husband had died, had remained a widow. The reasons for this opinion briefly are:<p>(1) That this is the interpretation most naturally suggested by the phrase;<p>(2) that it agrees better with the description of the one that was to be enrolled among the "number" - those who were "widows indeed" - as we should more naturally apply this term to one who had remained unmarried after the death of her husband, than to one who had been married again;<p>(3) that, while it was not unlawful or improper in itself for a widow to marry a second time, there was a degree of respect and honor attached to one who did not do it, which would not be felt for one who did; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36-37</a>, "She was a widow of great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity; and she was a widow of about fourscore and four years." The same is true now. There is a higher degree of respect felt for such a widow than there is for one who has been married again, though she may be again a widow.<p>(4) among the pagans, it was regarded as especially honorable to have been married to but one man, and such widows were the Pudicitioe Coronam, or crown of chastity; Val. Max. L. i. c. ii.; compare Livy, L. 10:c. 23; see Whitby.<p>(5) as these persons were not only to be maintained by the church, but appear also to have been entrusted with an office of guardianship over the younger females, it was of importance that they should have such a character that no occasion of offence should be given, even among the pagan; and, in order to that, Paul gave direction that only those should be thus enrolled who were in all respects widows, and who would be regarded, on account of their age and their whole deportment, as "widows indeed." I cannot doubt, therefore, that he meant to exclude those from the number here referred to who had been married the second time. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. Translate, "As a widow (that is, of the ecclesiastical order of widowhood; a kind of female presbytery), let none be enrolled (in the catalogue) who is less than sixty years old." These were not deaconesses, who were chosen at a younger age (forty was the age fixed at the Council of Chalcedon), and who had virgins (in a later age called widows) as well as widows among them, but a band of widows set apart, though not yet formally and finally, to the service of God and the Church. Traces of such a class appear in Ac 9:41. Dorcas herself was such a one. As it was expedient (see on [2478]1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:6) that the presbyter or bishop should have been but once married, so also in her case. There is a transition here to a new subject. The reference here cannot be, as in 1Ti 5:3, to providing Church sustenance for them. For the restriction to widows above sixty would then be needless and harsh, since many widows might be in need of help at a much earlier age; as also the rule that the widow must not have been twice married, especially since he himself, below (1Ti 5:14) enjoins the younger widows to marry again; as also that she must have brought up children. Moreover, 1Ti 5:10 presupposes some competence, at least in past times, and so poor widows would be excluded, the very class requiring charity. Also, 1Ti 5:11 would then be senseless, for then their remarrying would be a benefit, not an injury, to the Church, as relieving it of the burden of their sustenance. Tertullian [On the Veiling of Virgins, 9], Hermas [Shepherd, 1.2], and Chrysostom [Homily, 31], mention such an order of ecclesiastical widowhood, each one not less than sixty years old, and resembling the presbyters in the respect paid to them, and in some of their duties; they ministered with sympathizing counsel to other widows and to orphans, a ministry to which their own experimental knowledge of the feelings and sufferings of the bereaved adapted them, and had a general supervision of their sex. Age was doubtless a requisite in presbyters, as it is here stated to have been in presbyteresses, with a view to their influence on the younger persons of their sex They were supported by the Church, but not the only widows so supported (1Ti 5:3, 4).<p>wife of one man&#8212;in order not to throw a stumbling-block in the way of Jews and heathen, who regarded with disfavor second marriages (see on [2479]1Ti 3:2; Tit 1:6). This is the force of "blameless," giving no offense, even in matters indifferent.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Let not a widow be taken, into the number under threescore years old; </span> what number he meaneth is very doubtful, whether he means the number of deaconesses, or the number of such as should receive alms from the church. Those who translate katalegesyw here <span class="ital">chosen</span> seem to favour the former. They say, that in the primitive church there being a want of hospials and public places for the reception of people deceased in their estates, &c., they chose some old widows to take care of the poorer sort of women when they were sick, and these also were themselves maintained by the church, and served the church in that charitable employment. Whether this number, or the more general number of widows relieved by the church, be meant, the caution of their age was very prudent: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. Because younger widows could work for their living, and needed not to burden the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. Because under those years they probably might marry again, and so become useless to the church. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3.

To understand it of women that had not been twice married, their first husbands being dead, seems hard, no law of God forbidding the second marriages of men and women successively. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>3. Some therefore rather understand it of such widows as were become wives to second husbands, the first not being dead, but parted from them legally, either through their own fault, or through their voluntary desertion. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This the apostle seems to forbid, to avoid reproach and scandal to the church. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let not a widow be taken into the number,.... That is, of widows, to be maintained by the church; though some choose to understand these words of the number of such who were made deaconesses, and had the care of the poor widows of the church committed to them; and so the Arabic version renders it, "if a widow be chosen a deaconess"; but the former sense is best, for it appears from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-1.htm">1 Timothy 5:1</a> that the apostle is still speaking of widows to be relieved: now such were not to be taken under the church's care for relief, under threescore years old: for under this age it might be supposed they would marry, and so not be desolate, but would have husbands to provide for them; or they might be capable of labour, and so of taking care of themselves. The age of sixty years was by the Jews (x) reckoned   "old age", but not under. <p>Having been the wife of one man; that is, at one time; for second marriages are not hereby condemned, for this would be to condemn what the apostle elsewhere allows, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/7-2.htm">Romans 7:2</a>. Nor is the sense only, that she should be one who never had more husbands than one at once; for this was not usual for women to have more husbands than one, even where polygamy obtained, or where men had more wives than one: this rather therefore is to be understood of one who had never put away her husband, and married another, which was sometimes done among the Jews; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/10-12.htm">Mark 10:12</a>, and this being a scandalous practice, the apostle was willing to put a mark of infamy upon it, and exclude such persons who had been guilty of it from the number of widows relieved by the church. <p>(x) Pirke Abot, c. 5. sect. 21. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, having been the wife of <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> one man,</span><p>(9) The fourth rule: let none under sixty years old be taken into the number of widows, to serve the congregations or churches.

From this point the apostle takes up a special class of widows, viz. those who had been placed by the church on a formal list, and who accordingly possessed a certain position of honour in the church.

The various views regarding them have already been given in the Introduction, § 5; each has its special difficulties. Still Mosheim’s view is the most probable,[176] only what the apostle says of these widows does not justify us in transplanting into the apostolic age the ecclesiastical institution of the <span class="greekheb">χῆραι</span> (<span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτεραι</span>, <span class="greekheb">πρεσβύτιδες</span>) in the same form as it had at a later date. We have here only the tendencies from which the institution was gradually developed. Though the apostle takes it for granted that the church takes care of these widows, we cannot conclude that, as the older expositors assume,[177] he means by the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΑΤΑΛΕΓΈΣΘΩ</span></span></span> their reception into the number of the widows to be supported by the church.

Even van Oosterzee refers us to Mosheim; but he wrongly identifies the widows here mentioned with the deaconesses, whereas Mosheim clearly distinguishes between them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[177] Chrysostom in his commentary explains this passage as meaning, receiving in order to care for. In his <span class="ital">Hom.</span> 31, <span class="ital">in div. N. T. loc.</span>, however, he interprets it of receiving into an ecclesiastical office, saying: <span class="greekheb">καθάπερ εἰσὶ παρθένων χοροὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὕτω καὶ χηρῶν τὸ παλαιὸν ἦσαν χοροὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ οὐκ ἐξῆν αὐταῖς ἁπλῶς εἰς τὰς χήρας ἐγγράφεσθαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[178] This Hofmann wrongly disputes, wishing to lay the emphasis not on <span class="greekheb">παντὶ ἔργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγαθ</span>., but on <span class="greekheb">ἐπηκολούθησε</span>: “if there was any good to be done, <span class="ital">she was to follow after it with all diligence</span>, she was to make it her business.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[179] Bengel gives a peculiar reference to the word, which cannot be justified, saying: antistitum et virorum est bonis operibus praeire <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm" title="This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that you affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works.

He says that this verse only tells that “she must have fulfilled the duties of a mother and a Christian housewife.” But the enumeration of all these duties indicates that as a church-widow she must be practised in the exercise of many services of love.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1 Timothy 5:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">καταλεγέσθω</span>: St. Paul passes naturally from remarks about the duty of Church members to their widowed relatives to specific rules about the admission of widows to the roll of Church widows (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>).

These widows had no doubt a ministry to fulfil—a ministry of love, prayer, intercession, and giving of thanks (Polycarp, 4); but it is difficult to suppose that St. Paul, or any other practically minded administrator, would contemplate a presbyteral order of widows, the members of which would enter on their duties at the age of 60, an age relatively more advanced in the East and in the first century than in the West and in our own time. We may add that the general topic of widows’ maintenance is resumed and concluded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the references to widows in the earliest Christian literature outside the N.T. (with the exception of Ignatius <span class="ital">Smyrn</span>. 13) they are mentioned as objects of charity along with orphans, etc. (Ignatius, <span class="ital">Smyrn</span>. 6, <span class="ital">Polyc</span>. 4; Polycarp, 4; Hermas, <span class="ital">Vis</span>. ii. 4, <span class="ital">Mand</span>. viii., <span class="ital">Sim</span>. i. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, ix. 26, 27; Justin, <span class="ital">Apol</span>. i. 67). None of these places hints at an order of widows. The subject cannot be further discussed here; but the evidence seems to point to the conclusion that the later institution of widows as an order with official duties was suggested by this passage. The history of Christianity affords other examples of supposed revivals of apostolic institutions.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Ell., who follows Grotius in seeing in this verse regulations respecting an ecclesiastical or presbyteral widow, objects to the view taken above that it is “highly improbable that when criteria had been given, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> <span class="ital">sq.</span>, fresh should be added, and those of so very <span class="ital">exclusive</span> a nature: would the Church thus limit her alms?”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> <span class="ital">sq</span>. does not give the criteria, or qualifications of an official widow; but only describes the dominant characteristic of the life of the “widow indeed,” <span class="ital">viz.</span>, devotion; and again, the Church of every age, the apostolic not less than any other, has financial problems to deal with. Charity may be indiscriminating, but there are only a limited number of widows for whose whole support the Church can make itself responsible; and this is why the limit of age is here so high. At a much younger age than 60 a woman would cease to have any temptation to marry again.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Lightfoot has important notes on the subject in his commentary on Ignatius, <span class="ital">Smyrn</span>. §§ 6, 13 (<span class="ital">Apost. Fathers</span>, part ii. vol. ii. pp. 304, 322). See also, on the deaconess widow, Harnack, <span class="ital">Mission and Expansion of Christianity</span>, trans. vol. i. p. 122. The opinion of Schleiermacher that deaconesses are referred to here is refuted (1) by the provision of age, and (2) by the fact that they have been dealt with before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.">1 Timothy 3:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to Bengel, the gen. <span class="greekheb">ἐτῶν</span> depends on <span class="greekheb">χήρα</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἔλαττον</span> being an adverb, “of 60 years, not less”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">γεγονυῖα</span>: It is best to connect this with the preceding words, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-42.htm" title="And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.">Luke 2:42</a>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ ὅτε ἐγένετο ἐτῶν δώδεκα</span>.

More definite direction is now given as to the honour and the qualification, <span class="ital">Let not a widow be taken into the number</span>. The position of the word ‘widow’ at the beginning of the sentence makes it probably part of the predicate, as R.V., <span class="bld">Let none be enrolled as a widow</span>. A roll or catalogue of widows for whom the alms of the Church were bespoken existed from the very first, Acts 6 and has been the care of each Church and each parish to a greater or less extent to the present day under varying forms and conditions:—the least satisfactory arrangement on a large scale being the provision made by Christian England of ‘The House’; the most satisfactory being the pleasant almshouses dotted over the country, and the pension moneys from our Church alms taken month by month as from Christ with delicate attention by our deacon curates themselves to the cottage homes. Those who have had to select from such a list in a parish will have found the hints for selection given here very useful and necessary; (1) ascertained impossibility of support from relatives; (2) good moral character as wife and widow; (3) a defined period for ‘old age’; (4) reputation as a good mother, a kind neighbour, a zealous Church worker.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">under threescore years old</span>] Lit. ‘who is found to be less than 60 years old,’ the participle belonging to the previous clause, according to the general usage: cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-42.htm" title="And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast.">Luke 2:42</a>, ‘when he was twelve years old.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">having been the wife of one man</span>] ‘Having been,’ if retained should be put as by R.V. in italics, marking it as an English insertion; the phrase ‘wife of one man’ is precisely the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where see note. The clear and indisputable meaning here of the words is that of having been faithful to one husband all his lifetime instead of leaving him for another or adding another, ‘no bigamist or adulteress.’ She is to be ‘enrolled’ as such. <span class="ital">Many</span> of the N.T. exhortations on this point are startling to us as implying even in the circle of Christians very lax principles and habits still. And yet English ministerial knowledge could tell of many startling views and habits that prevail among us now in respect of the sanctity and purity of the married state. It is no ‘counsel of perfection’ but the plain elementary pledge ‘to live together—till death’s parting—<span class="ital">after God’s ordinance</span> in the holy estate of matrimony,’ that St Paul here commends.

But the apostle would by no means praise those who would thrust their younger daughters into monasteries, where they may remain from their youth up to their death.—<span class="greekheb">ἑνὸς</span>, <span class="ital">of one</span>) <span class="ital">i.e.</span> who has been lawfully married, or has had one husband, or one and afterwards a second.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[40] A widow having attained the age of sixty years—not less.—ED.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as a widow</span> for <span class="accented">let not a widow be taken into the number</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Let none be enrolled</span>, etc. The proper translation seems certainly to be (Ellicott, Alford, Huther, etc.), <span class="accented">let a woman be enrolled as a widow not under sixty years old</span>; <span class="accented">i.e.</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c7;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;</span> a is the predicate, not the subject. It follows that the word "widow" here is used in a slightly different sense from that in the preceding verses, viz. in the technical sense of one belonging to the <span class="accented">order of widows</span>, of which it appears from the word <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span> there was a regular roll kept in the Church. We do not know enough of the Church institutions of the apostolic age to enable us to say positively what their status or their functions were, but doubtless they were the germ from which the later development (of which see Bingham, bk. 7. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4.htm">1 Timothy 4</a>.) took its rise. We may gather, however, from the passage before us that their lives were specially consecrated to the service of God and the Church; that they were expected to be instant and con-slant in prayer, and to devote themselves to works of charity; that the apostle did not approve of their marrying again after their having embraced this life of widowhood, and therefore would have none enrolled under sixty years of age; and generally that, once on the roll, they would continue there for their life. <span class="cmt_word">Enrolled</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;</span>); only here in the New Testament or (in this sense) in the LXX.; but it is the regular classical word for enrolling, enlisting, soldiers, etc. Hence our word "catalogue." In like manner, in the times of the Empress Helena, the virgins of the Church are described as <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bc;&#x3bc;&#x1f73;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1ff7;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3ba;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;</span> (Socr., 1:17), "registered in the Church's register," or list of virgins. <span class="cmt_word">Under three score years old.</span> A similar rule was laid down in several early canons, which forbade the veiling of virgins before the age of <span class="accented">forty</span>. This care to prevent women from being entangled by vows or engagements which they had not well considered, or of which they did not know the full force, is in striking contrast with the system which allows young girls to make irrevocable vows. The participle <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>, "being," belongs to this clause (not as in the A.V. to the following one), as Alford clearly shows, and as the R.V. also indicates, by putting <span class="accented">having been</span> in italics; though it does not translate <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span> in this clause, unless possibly the word "old" is considered as representing <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x1fd6;&#x3b1;</span>. It should <span class="accented">be</span>, <span class="accented">Let none be enrolled as widows</span>, <span class="accented">being under sixty years of age</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>The wife of one man</span>; see above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, the similar phrase, "the husband of one wife" (which likewise stands without any participle), and the note there. To which may be added that it is hardly conceivable that St. Paul should within the compass of a few verses (see ver. 14) recommend the marriage of young widows, and yet make the fact of a second marriage an absolute bar to a woman being enrolled among the Church widows. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/5.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Be taken into the number (&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b8;&#x3c9;)<p>Better, enrolled (as a widow).
