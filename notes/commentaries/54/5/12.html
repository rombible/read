The context of the passage must in all cases decide the nature of the “judgment,” whether favourable or the contrary. Here it signifies that those who in after days give up a work which for their Master’s sake they had undertaken, expose themselves to a searching judgment, which will thoroughly sift the reasons that induced them to forsake the begun toil, and that, if the reasons be not satisfactory, will be unfavourable, and will surely involve condemnation.<p><span class= "bld">Because they have cast off their first faith.</span>—Though, probably, no vows respecting marriage were required from those widows who devoted themselves to the Lord’s service, yet virtually such a solemn enrolment partook of the nature of a life-long engagement—an engagement which, if they married again, must necessarily be given up.<p>Such a going back, such a giving up the higher and the more devoted life—the life of self-sacrifice, of self-abnegation—for the ordinary joys and cares of domestic life, for the useful but still every-day pursuits of ordinary men and women—such a going back, would be indeed a casting off their first faith, and such an example of backsliding could not fail to harm the cause of Christ.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Having damnation - Or, rather, having "condemnation;" or incurring guilt. This does not mean of necessity that they would lose their souls; see the phrase explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-29.htm">1 Corinthians 11:29</a>. The meaning is, that they would contract guilt, if they had been admitted among this class of persons, and then married again. The apostle does not say that that would be wrong in itself (compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>), or that they would be absolutely prohibited from it, but that injury would be done if they were admitted among those who were "widows indeed" - who were supported by the church, and who were entrusted with a certain degree of care over the more youthful females - and then should leave that situation. It might give occasion for scandal it might break in upon the arrangements; it would show that there was a relaxing of the faith, and of the deadness to the world, which they were supposed to have; and it was better that they should be married <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, without having been thus admitted.<p>Because they have cast off their first faith - This does not mean that they would lose all their religion, or wholly fall away, but that this would show that they had not the strong faith, the deadness to the world, the simple dependence on God <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm">1 Timothy 5:5</a>, and the desire which they had to be weaned from worldly cares and influences, which they once had. When they became widows, all their earthly hopes seemed to be blasted. They were then dead to the world, and felt their sole dependence on God. But if, under the influence of these strong emotions, they were admitted to the "class of widows" in the church, there was no certainty that they would continue in this state of mind. Time would do much to modify their grief. There would be a reviving love of the world, and under the influence of this they would be disposed to enter again into the marriage relation, and thus show that they had not the strong and simple faith which they had when the blow which made them widows fell heavily upon then. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12.

There could be no hardship at the age of sixty or upwards in not marrying again (end of 1Ti 5:9), for the sake of serving better the cause of Christ as presbyteresses; though, to ordinary widows, no barrier existed against remarriage (1Co 7:39). This is altogether distinct from Rome's unnatural vows of celibacy in the case of young marriageable women. The widow-presbyteresses, moreover, engaged to remain single, not as though single life were holier than married life (according to Rome's teaching), but because the interests of Christ's cause made it desirable (see on [2480]1Ti 3:2). They had pledged "their first faith" to Christ as presbyteress widows; they now wish to transfer their faith to a husband (compare 1Co 7:32, 34).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This sentence is not without its difficulties: here are two questions: <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1. What is meant by krima, which we both here and elsewhere translate <span class="bld">damnation.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>2. How they <span class="bld">cast off their first faith.</span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Many think the Greek word by us translated <span class="ital">damnation, </span> ought to have had a softer sense, it being certainly capable of it. Some think it signifies here no more than guilt, or a blot; others, a public infamy; others, the judgment of good men against them. But it may be we cannot so well determine this without understanding what is meant by <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">their first faith, </span> which they are here said to <span class="ital">have cast off:</span> by which some understand their profession of Christianity; others, their promise or engagement to the church, not to marry. The latter sense supposeth that all those widows that were taken into the ministry of the church before mentioned, promised that they would keep themselves unmarried, which is a most groundless supposition. I do rather think that by <span class="ital">their first faith, </span> he means their first or former profession of Christianity; which was a crime that did expose them not only to the judgment and censure of sober Christians, but to eternal damnation. I shall offer my own sense of this text thus: it is certain these Christians were lilies among thorns, a small handful amongst a far greater number of pagans; and it is not improbable, that some younger widows, out of a desire to marry, might marry to pagans, and be by them tempted to apostacy from the Christian profession; upon which the apostle orders, that none under sixty years of age should be henceforth taken into the ministry of the church, lest doing such a thing when they were under that character, it should be a greater scandal. This seems the more probable from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1 Timothy 5:15</a></span>, where the apostle adds, <span class="ital">for some are already turned aside after Satan.</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And withal they learn to be idle,.... Being at ease, and without labour, living at the expense of the church: "wandering about from house to house"; having nothing else to do: such an one is what the Jews (z) call , "the gadding widow"; who, as the gloss says, <p>"goes about and visits her neighbours continually; and these are they that corrupt the world.'' <p>Of this sort of women must the Jews be understood, when they say (a), it is one of the properties of them to be "going out", or gadding abroad, as Dinah did; and that it is another to be   "talkative", which agrees with what follows: <p>and not only idle, but tattlers also; full of talk, who have always some news to tell, or report to make of the affairs of this, or the other person, or family: <p>and busy bodies; in the matters of other persons, which do not concern them: <p>speaking things which they ought not; which either are not true, and, if they are, are not to be spoken of, and carried from place to place: this is a very great inconvenience, the apostle observes, arising from the admission of such young widows to be relieved and maintained at the church's charge. <p>(z) T.

There is variance only in the more precise definition of <span class="greekheb">κρίμα</span>, whether it is to be understood as the judgment of God (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee), or the judgment of men (Wegscheider: “they draw blame on themselves;” Plitt: “they meet with reproof”), or the judgment of their own conscience (so in this commentary; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;">1 Timothy 4:2</a> : <span class="greekheb">κεκαυτηριασένοι τὴν ἰδίαν συνείδησιν</span>). Hofmann takes <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as “because,” as there is no article with <span class="greekheb">κρίμα</span>: “they are liable to condemnation;” but this makes the meaning of <span class="greekheb">κρίμα ἔχειν</span> too vague. Since the use of the article in the N. T. is so wavering, it is difficult to come to a definite conclusion. Plitt’s explanation may be taken as the most natural.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι τὴν πρώτην πίστιν ἠθέτησαν</span>] <span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν ἀθετεῖν</span> in Polybius (who often uses <span class="greekheb">ἀθετεῖν</span> by itself) is “fidem fallere, break a pledge.” This meaning has rightly been maintained here by most. So Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">παρέβησαν τὰς συνθήκας</span>; Augustine on Ps. lxxv.: primam fidem irritam fecerunt; voverunt et non reddiderunt. We cannot infer from this expression that any formal oath not to marry again was demanded when they were received into the number of church-widows; but it certainly does follow that the reception pledged the widows to devote their lives only to the service of the Lord. To this pledge they were unfaithful so soon as they began the behaviour described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-11.htm" title="But the younger widows refuse: for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry;">1 Timothy 5:11</a>. It is out of place here to appeal to such passages in the Fathers as testify that in later times the <span class="ital">deaconesses</span> had to vow that they would not marry. <span class="greekheb">Πρώτην</span> does not stand for <span class="greekheb">πρότεραν</span>, but is used by the apostle because the vow (tacit or expressed) to serve the Lord was taken at the <span class="ital">beginning</span> of their new position in life. Calvin wrongly takes the <span class="greekheb">πρώτη πίστις</span> as the fides in <span class="ital">baptismo</span> data, referring the unfaithfulness to the desire to marry, which is defined more precisely by <span class="greekheb">ὅταν καταστρηνιάσωσι τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Χρ</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/5.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-12.htm" title="Having damnation, because they have cast off their first faith.">1 Timothy 5:12</a>. <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσαι κρίμα</span>: <span class="ital">deserving censure</span>. There is no special force in <span class="greekheb">ἔχουσαι</span>, as Ell. explains, “bearing about with them a judgment, <span class="ital">viz.</span>, that they broke their first faith”. This seems forced and unnatural. <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν κρίμα</span> is correlative to <span class="greekheb">λαμβάνεσθαι κρίμα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/12-40.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayers: these shall receive greater damnation.">Mark 12:40</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/20-47.htm" title="Which devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater damnation.">Luke 20:47</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-2.htm" title="Whoever therefore resists the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation.">Romans 13:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/3-1.htm" title="My brothers, be not many masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater condemnation.">Jam 3:1</a>).
