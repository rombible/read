And those who are laborious in this work are worthy of double honour and esteem. It is their just due, as much as the reward of the labourer. The apostle charges Timothy solemnly to guard against partiality. We have great need to watch at all times, that we do not partake of other men's sins. Keep thyself pure, not only from doing the like thyself, but from countenancing it, or any way helping to it in others. The apostle also charges Timothy to take care of his health. As we are not to make our bodies masters, so neither slaves; but to use them so that they may be most helpful to us in the service of God. There are secret, and there are open sins: some men's sins are open before-hand, and going before unto judgment; some they follow after. God will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and make known the counsels of all hearts. Looking forward to the judgment-day, let us all attend to our proper offices, whether in higher or lower stations, studying that the name and doctrine of God may never be blasphemed on our account.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For the Scripture saith - This is adduced as a reason why a church should show all due respect and care for its ministers. The reason is, that as God took care to make provision for the laboring ox, much more should due attention be paid to those who labor for the welfare of the church.<p>Thou shalt not muzzle the ox - see this passage explained, and its bearing on such an argument shown, in the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-8.htm">1 Corinthians 9:8-10</a>.<p>And, The labourer is worthy of his reward - This expression is found substantially in <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>. It does not occur in so many words in the Old Testament, and yet the apostle adduces it evidently as a quotation from the Scriptures, and as authority in the case. It would seem probable, therefore, that he had seen the Gospel by Matthew or by Luke, and that he quoted this as a part of Scripture, and regarded the Book from which he made the quotation as of the same authority as the Old Testament. If so, then this may be regarded as an attestation of the apostle to the inspiration of the "Gospel" in which it was found. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. the scripture&#8212;(De 25:4; quoted before in 1Co 9:9).<p>the ox that treadeth out&#8212;Greek, An ox while treading.<p>The labourer is worthy of his reward&#8212;or "hire"; quoted from Lu 10:7, whereas Mt 10:10 has "his meat," or "food." If Paul extends the phrase, "Scripture saith," to this second clause, as well as to the first, he will be hereby recognizing the Gospel of Luke, his own helper (whence appears the undesigned appositeness of the quotation), as inspired Scripture. This I think the correct view. The Gospel according to Luke was probably in circulation then about eight or nine years. However, it is possible "Scripture saith" applies only to the passage quoted from De 25:4; and then his quotation will be that of a common proverb, quoted also by the Lord, which commends itself to the approval of all, and is approved by the Lord and His apostle.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This verse maketh it evident that maintenance is part of the <span class="ital">double honour</span> that is due to such as labour in the word and doctrine in the first place: and not to them alone, but to any such as are employed in the rule and government of the church.

The ox, for its strength and labour, is a fit emblem of a Gospel minister; and its treading the corn out of the husk and ear aptly represents the beating out, as it were, of Gospel truths, by the ministers of it, their making the doctrines of the Gospel clear, plain, and evident to the understandings of men; wherefore, as the ox was not muzzled when it trod out the corn, but might freely and largely feed upon it, so such who labour in the preaching of the Gospel ought to have a sufficient and competent maintenance: for which purpose this citation is made, as also the following: <p>and the labourer is worthy of his reward; which seems to be taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a> which Gospel was now written, and in the hands of the apostle; who here, by two testimonies, the one from Moses, and the other from Christ, supports the right of the honourable maintenance of the ministers of the Gospel. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the scripture saith, Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth out the corn.

The question has been prejudged by supposed necessary limitations as to the earliest possible date for a gospel; and many have thought it safest to adopt Stier’s statement that <span class="greekheb">ἄξιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. was a common proverb made use of both by our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm" title="And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.">Luke 10:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm" title="Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.">Matthew 10:10</a>), and by St. Paul. In that case, it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that St. Paul forgot that it was not <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span>; for here it is not natural to take <span class="greekheb">ἄξιος</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as a supplementary or confirmatory statement by the writer in the words of a well-known proverb. The proverb, if it be such, is rather the second item in <span class="greekheb">ἡ γραφή</span>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2 Timothy 2:19</a>, the “seal” consists of (<span class="ital">a</span>) “The Lord knoweth them that are his,” and (<span class="ital">b</span>) “Let every one that nameth,” etc. Our Lord no doubt employed proverbs that were current in His time, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-23.htm" title="And he said to them, You will surely say to me this proverb, Physician, heal yourself: whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in your country.">Luke 4:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/4-37.htm" title="And herein is that saying true, One sows, and another reaps.">John 4:37</a>. In both these cases He intimates that He is doing so; but He does not do so in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm" title="Nor money for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.">Matthew 10:10</a>, or <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm" title="And in the same house remain, eating and drinking such things as they give: for the laborer is worthy of his hire. Go not from house to house.">Luke 10:7</a>. Besides, while the variation here between Matt. (<span class="greekheb">τῆς τροφῆς</span>) and Luke (<span class="greekheb">τοῦ μισθοῦ</span>) is of the same degree as in other cases of varying reports of Sayings from Q common to Matthew and Luke, yet such variation in wording is not likely in the case of a well-known proverb. We may add that it is difficult to know to what ruling of Christ reference is made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-14.htm" title="Even so has the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel.">1 Corinthians 9:14</a> if it be not this Saying. Critical opinion has recently grown inclined to believe that much of the gospel material which underlies the Synoptists was put into writing before our Lord’s earthly ministry closed. (See Sanday, <span class="ital">The Life of Christ in Recent Research</span>, p. 172.) The only question, therefore, is not, Could St. Paul have read the Evangelic narrative? but, Could he have coordinated a gospel document with the written oracles of God, venerated by every Hebrew as having a sanctity all their own? The question cannot be considered apart from what we know to have been St. Paul’s conception of the person of Jesus Christ. We may readily grant that it would be a surprising thing if St. Paul thought of the writings of any contemporary apostle as “Scripture,” as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-16.htm" title="As also in all his letters, speaking in them of these things; in which are some things hard to be understood, which they that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.">2 Peter 3:16</a> does; but since he believed that Christ was “the end of the Law” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-4.htm" title="For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes.">Romans 10:4</a>), it would be surprising were he not to have esteemed His words to be at least as authoritative as the Law which He superseded.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The order in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/25-4.htm" title="You shall not muzzle the ox when he treads out the corn.">Deuteronomy 25:4</a> is <span class="greekheb">οὐ φιμ</span>. <span class="greekheb">βοῦν ἀλο</span>. The same text is quoted, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-9.htm" title="For it is written in the law of Moses, You shall not muzzle the mouth of the ox that treads out the corn. Does God take care for oxen?">1 Corinthians 9:9</a> in the form <span class="greekheb">οὐ κημώσεις βοῦν ἀλο</span>. ([285]*[286]*[287] [288]). St. Paul’s treatment of the command, as pointing to an analogy in the life of human beings, does not need any defence. Our just repudiation of the spirit in which he asks in 1 Cor., “Is it for the oxen that God careth?” must not blind us to the large element of truth in his answer, “Yea, for our sake it was written”.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[285] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[286] Codex Claromontanus (sæc. vi.), a Græco-Latin MS. at Paris, edited by Tischendorf in 1852.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[287] Codex Augiensis (sæc. ix.), a Græco-Latin MS., at Trinity College, Cambridge, edited by Scrivener in 1859.

The ox was not to be hindered from eating some portion of the grain which he was treading out.

The conclusion is inevitable that the writer of this Epistle was acquainted with and quoted from St. Luke's Gospel; and further, that he deemed it, or at least the saying of the Lord Jesus recorded, in it, to be of equal authority with "<span class="greek">&#x1f21;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c6;&#x1f75;</span>," the Scripture. If this Epistle was written by St. Paul after his first imprisonment at Rome, we may feel tolerably certain that he was acquainted with the Gospel or St. Luke, so that there is no improbability in his quoting from it. His reference to another saying of the Lord Jesus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-35.htm">Acts 20:35</a> gives additional probability to it. The passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-18.htm">2 Timothy 4:18</a> seems also to be a direct reference to the Lord's Prayer, as contained in the Gospels of St. Matthew and St. Luke.

Comp. &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; a threshing-floor, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-12.htm">Matthew 3:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/3-17.htm">Luke 3:17</a>. An analogy to the O.T. injunction may be found in the laws giving to the Athenians by the mythical Triptolemus, one of which was, "Hurt not the laboring beast." Some one having violated this command by slaying a steer which was eating the sacred cake that lay upon the altar, - an expiation-feast, Bouphonia or Diipolta was instituted for the purpose of atoning for this offense, and continued to be celebrated in Athens. Aristophanes refers to it (Clouds, 985). A laboring ox was led to the altar of Zeus on the Acropolis, which was strewn with wheat and barley. As soon as the ox touched the grain, he was killed by a blow from an axe. The priest who struck the blow threw away the axe and fled. The flesh of the ox was then eaten, and the hide was stuffed and set before the plough. Then began the steer-trial before a judicial assembly in the Prytaneum, by which the axe was formally condemned to be thrown into the sea.<p>The laborer is worthy, etc.<p>A second scriptural quotation would seem to be indicated, but there is no corresponding passage in the O.T. The words are found <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/10-7.htm">Luke 10:7</a>, and, with a slight variation, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a>. Some hold that the writer adds to the O.T. citation a popular proverb, and that Christ himself used the words in this way. But while different passages of Scripture are often connected in citation by &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768;, it is not according, to N.T. usage thus to connect Scripture and proverb. Moreover, in such series of citations it is customary to use &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; and again, or &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; simply. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-7.htm">Matthew 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-33.htm">Matthew 5:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-39.htm">John 12:39</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/15-9.htm">Romans 15:9-12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/3-20.htm">1 Corinthians 3:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-5.htm">Hebrews 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-13.htm">Hebrews 2:13</a>. According to others, the writer here cites an utterance of Christ from oral tradition, coordinately with the O.T. citation, as Scripture. Paul, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm">1 Thessalonians 4:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-10.htm">1 Corinthians 7:10</a>, appeals to a word of the Lord; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/10-35.htm">Acts 10:35</a> he is represented as quoting "it is more blessed to give than to receive" as the words of Jesus. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9.htm">1 Corinthians 9</a>, in the discussion of this passage from Deuteronomy, Paul adds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9-14.htm">1 Corinthians 9:14</a>) "even so hath the Lord ordained that they which preach the gospel should live of the gospel," which resembles the combination here. This last is the more probable explanation. </body></html>
