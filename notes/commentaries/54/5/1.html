And, first, he warns him against a misplaced zeal, which might urge him to unbefitting behaviour towards those older than himself. The enthusiastic and ardent young servant of Christ would see with sorrow and dismay the shortcomings of many an elder member of his flock, and, forgetting to make wise allowance for previous training, thought, and habits, would be likely, unwisely, and possibly unfairly, to find fault. Let him, in the cases of his elders—for the reference is rather to age than to office, as is clear from the reminder of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-2.htm" title="The elder women as mothers; the younger as sisters, with all purity.">1Timothy 5:2</a>, addressed to the “elder women”—instead of open rebuke, use respectful and affectionate entreaties, after the manner of a son, not of an official.<p><span class= "bld">The younger men as brethren.</span>—And as regards the younger Christians of Ephesua, let them not be alienated by an assumption of dignity on the part of the chief presbyter of the Church. Let his relations with these younger members of the family of Christ be rather those of a brother and a friend than of a superior in rank and dignity.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/5.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-1.htm" title="Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;...">1 Timothy 5:1-2</a></span>. Because it is the duty of ministers to reprove such of their people as err in principle or practice, and because the success of reproof depends, in a great measure, upon the manner in which it is given, the apostle here proceeds to direct Timothy in that important branch of his office. <span class="ital">Rebuke not — </span>Or rather, <span class="ital">rebuke not severely, </span>the phrase, <span class="greekheb">μη επιπληξης</span>, literally signifying, <span class="ital">do not strike, </span>and metaphorically, <span class="ital">do not sharply reprove; an elder </span>— Or aged man, as the word <span class="greekheb">πρεσβυτερω </span>here evidently signifies, being opposed to <span class="greekheb">νεωτερους</span>, <span class="ital">the younger, </span>in the following clause.

This is evident, because the apostle immediately mentions in contradistinction from the elder, "the younger men," where it cannot be supposed that he refers to them as officers. The command to treat the "elder" as a "father," also shows the same thing. By the direction not to rebuke, it is not to be supposed that the minister of the gospel is not to admonish the aged, or that he is not to show them their sins when they go astray, but that he is to do this as he would to a father. He is not to assume a harsh, dictatorial, and denunciatory manner. The precepts of religion always respect the proprieties of life, and never allow us to transgress them, even when the object is to reclaim a soul from error, and to save one who is wandering. Besides, when this is the aim, it will always be most certainly accomplished by observing the respect due to others on account of office, relation, rank, or age.<p>But entreat him as a father - As you would a father. That is, do not harshly denounce him. Endeavor to persuade him to lead a more holy life. One of the things for which the ancients were remarkable above most of the moderns, and for which the Orientals are still distinguished, was respect for age. Few things are enjoined with more explicitness and emphasis in the Bible than this; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-32.htm">Leviticus 19:32</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/29.htm">Job 29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/20-20.htm">Proverbs 20:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/proverbs/30-17.htm">Proverbs 30:17</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/7-9.htm">Daniel 7:9-10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/1-14.htm">Revelation 1:14-15</a>. The apostle would have Timothy, and, for the same reason, every other minister of the gospel, a model of this virtue.<p>And the younger men as brethren - That is, treat them as you would your own brothers. Do not consider them as aliens, strangers, or enemies, but entertain toward them, even when they go astray, the kindly feelings of a brother. This refers more particularly to his private conversation with them, and to his personal efforts to reclaim them when they had fallen into sin. When these efforts were ineffectual, and they sinned openly, he was to "rebuke them before all" <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-20.htm">1 Timothy 5:20</a>, that others might be deterred from following their example. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 5<p>1Ti 5:1-25.

By whom is meant, not an elder in office, but in age; for elders by office are afterwards spoken of, and particular rules concerning them are given, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a>. Besides, an elder is here opposed, not to a private member of a church, but to young men in age; and the apostle is here giving rules to be observed in rebuking members of churches, according to their different age and sex, and not according to their office and station; and this sense is confirmed by a parallel text in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a>. Now an ancient man, a member of a church, is not to be rebuked in a sharp and severe way; the word here used signifies to smite or strike; and so the Arabic version renders it, "do not strike an elder"; meaning not with the hand, but with the tongue, giving hard words, which are as heavy blows; reproof is a smiting, and there is a gentle and a sharp one, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/141-4.htm">Psalm 141:4</a>. It is with the former, and not the latter, that man in years is to be reproved, when he is in a fault, whether with respect to doctrine or practice, as such persons may be as well as younger ones; and when they are observed to err, they should not be roughly and sharply dealt with: <p>but entreat him as a father; as a child should entreat a father, when he is going out of the way; give him honour and respect, fear and reverence, and persuade him to desist; entreat and beseech him to return to the right path of truth and holiness; use him as a father in Christ, that has known him that is from the beginning, and as of long standing in the church: this must be understood of lesser crimes, and not of atrocious and flagitious ones, obstinately continued in, to the great scandal of religion, and dishonour of the Gospel; for then severer methods must be used; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-20.htm">Isaiah 45:20</a>. But though this is the sense of the passage, yet the argument from hence is strong, that if an elder in years, a private member, who is ancient, and in a fault, is not to be roughly used, but gently entreated, then much more an elder in office. <p>And the younger men as brethren; the Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions read, "as thy brethren". Timothy was a young man himself; and as he was to consider an elderly man as his father, and use him accordingly; so he was to consider young men as equal with him, at least in age, and take the more freedom with them, in reproving them for their faults, and use somewhat more authority with them; and yet consider them as brethren in Christ, and reprove them in a brotherly way, and with brotherly love. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Rebuke <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> not an elder, but intreat <i>him</i> as a father; <i>and</i> the younger men as brethren;</span><p>(1) Of giving personal reprehensions appropriately, according to the degrees of ages and gender.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-1.htm" title="Rebuke not an elder, but entreat him as a father; and the younger men as brothers;...">1 Timothy 5:1-2</a>.

By <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀδελφούς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀδελφάς</span> it is implied that Timothy was not to exalt himself over those who were of the same age as himself or younger, but that he was to deal with them in brotherly love as his equals.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The addition <span class="greekheb">ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνείᾳ</span>, which follows <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀδελφάς</span>, may grammatically be referred to all the members; but Chrysostom[170] and most expositors since, connect it closely with the words immediately preceding. Rightly; since, even when taken in the more general sense of “purity of morals” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm" title="Let no man despise your youth; but be you an example of the believers, in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity.">1 Timothy 4:12</a>), it cannot rightly be referred to the preceding relations; but it is very appropriate to the last, all the more if it be taken in the more special sense of “modesty, chastity.”[171]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[170] Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">μὴ μοί</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὴν τῆς μίξεως μόνον εἴπῃς ἁμαρτίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀλλὰ μηδὲ ὑποψίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">φησὶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">δῷς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἐπ ιδὴ γὰρ αἱ πρὸς τὰς νεωτέρας γενόμεναι ὁμιλίαι δυσκόλως διαφεύγουσιν ὑποψίαν</span>, <span class="greekheb">δεῖ δὲ γίνεσθαι παρὰ τοῦ ἐπισκόπου καὶ τοῦτο</span>, <span class="greekheb">διὰ τοῦτο ἐν πάσῃ ἁγνείᾳ προστίθησι</span>.—On the words <span class="greekheb">ὡς ἀδελφάς</span>, Bengel briefly and aptly says: hic respectus egregie adjuvat castitatem.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[171] Comp.

The wise Church ruler must understand how to deal with his people individually. Each age and condition needs separate treatment: old men, young men; old women, young women. Widows in particular need discriminating care; since some of them may have to be supported by the Church; and we must not let the Church be imposed on, nor give occasion for scandal.

Timothy was not to go so far as St Paul went in his rebuke of St Peter, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/2-11.htm" title="But when Peter was come to Antioch, I withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed.">Galatians 2:11</a>, ‘I resisted him to the face because he stood condemned;’ much less to copy his rebuke of Ananias, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-3.htm" title="Then said Paul to him, God shall smite you, you white washed wall: for sit you to judge me after the law, and command me to be smitten contrary to the law?">Acts 23:3</a>, ‘God shall smite thee, thou whited wail.’ See in the Prayer-Book Order for the Consecration of Bishops, the prayer that the new bishop may be ‘earnest to reprove, beseech and rebuke, with all patience and doctrine.’ This seems exactly to cover the ground held by the next word ‘intreat,’ again (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm" title="As I sought you to abide still at Ephesus, when I went into Macedonia, that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,">1 Timothy 1:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm" title="I exhort therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men;">1 Timothy 2:1</a>) to be rendered <span class="bld">exhort</span>.

The context shows that the meaning is not a "presbyter," but "an old man." The precept has relation to Timothy's youth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>).

Observe, too, how even m reproving the sense of love is to be main- mined.

Modern critical opinion has largely abandoned the view that the original Christian polity was an imitation of that of the Synagogue. The secular and religious authorities of the Jewish communities, at least in purely Jewish localities, were the same; a fact which is against the probability that the polity was directly transferred to the Christian church. The prerogatives of the Jewish elders have nothing corresponding with them in extent in the Christian community. Functions which emerge later in the Jewish-Christian communities of Palestine do not exist in the first Palestinian-Christian society. At the most, as Weizscker observes, it could only be a question of borrowing a current name.<p>Modern criticism compels us, I think, to abandon the view of the identity of Bishop and Presbyter which has obtained such wide acceptance, especially among English scholars, through the discussions of Lightfoot and Hatch. The testimony of Clement of Rome (Ep. ad Corinth.) goes to show that the Bishops (&#x3b7;&#788;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; or &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b7;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;) are distinguished from the Presbyters, and that if the Bishops are apparently designated as Presbyters, it is, because they have been chosen from the body of Presbyters, and have retained the name even when they have ceased to hold office. for this reason deceased Bishops are called Presbyters. In Clement, Presbyters signify a class or estate - members of long standing and approved character, and not office-bearers regularly appointed. Among these the Bishops are to be sought. Bishops are reckoned as Presbyters, not because the Presbyter as such is a Bishop, but because the Bishop as such is a Presbyter. In the Pastorals, Bishops and Deacons are associated without mention of Presbyters (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1-13</a>). Presbyters are referred to in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17-19</a>, but in an entirely different connection. The qualifications of Bishops and Deacons are detailed in the former passage, and the list of qualifications concludes with the statement that this is the ordering of the church as the house of God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-15.htm">1 Timothy 5:15</a>). The offices are exhausted in the description of Bishops and Deacons. Nothing is said of Presbyters until ch. 5, where Timothy's relations to individual church-members are prescribed; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-2.htm">Titus 2:2</a> ff. these members are classified as old men (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;) old women, young men, and servants. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-17.htm">1 Timothy 5:17</a> are mentioned elders who rule well (&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2; &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b2;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;). Assuming that Presbyters and Bishops were identical, a distinction would thus be implied between two classes of Bishops - those who rule well and those who do not: where as the distinction is obviously between old and honored church-members, collectively considered, forming the presbyterial body, and certain of their number who show their qualifications for appointment as overseers. Presbyters as such are not invested with office. There is no formal act constituting a Presbyter. The Bishops are reckoned among the Elders, but the elders as such are not officers.<p>Thus are to be explained the allusions to appointed Elders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-5.htm">Titus 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-23.htm">Acts 14:23</a>. Elders are to be appointed as overseers or Bishops, for the overseers must have the qualifications of approved Presbyters. The ordination of Presbyters is the setting apart of Elders to the position of Superintendents. The Presbyterate denotes an honorable and influential estate in the church on the ground of age, duration of church membership, and approved character. Only Bishops are appointed. There is no appointment to the Presbyterate. At the close of Clement's letter to the Corinthians, the qualifications of a Presbyter are indicated in the description of the three commissioners from the Roman church who are the bearers of the letter, and to whom no official title is given. They are old, members of the Roman church from youth, blameless in life, believing, and sober. </body></html>
