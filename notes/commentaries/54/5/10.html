It must not, of course, be supposed that St. Paul deemed it necessary to exclude from the order of presbyteral widows the childless mothers. Only the candidate for admission must be well known as one who loves children, and would be ready and willing gladly to discharge any public duties to the little orphan ones of the flock who might be intrusted to her care.<p><span class= "bld">If she have lodged strangers.</span>—If, even in a comparatively humble state, she have been always mindful of the sacred rites of hospitality, a virtue perhaps even more valued in the East than in the more reserved Western countries. In the early days of the new faith, the readiness to entertain and welcome Christian strangers seems to have been an especial characteristic of believers in Jesus of Nazareth.<p><span class= "bld">If she have washed the saints’ feet.</span>—Not perhaps to be understood literally, though the act of the Lord on the night before the Cross had invested this act of common hospitality with a peculiar halo of love and devotion. The woman who was to be admitted into the fellowship of this honoured order must be well known as one who had never shrunk from any act of devoted love, however painful or seemingly degrading.<p><span class= "bld">If she have relieved the afflicted.</span>—Not merely, or even chiefly, by alms, but by all kindly and sisterly encouragement: ever ready to mourn with those that mourn, deeming none too low or too degraded for her friendship, none out of the reach of her sisterly help and counsel.<p><span class= "bld">If she have diligently followed every good work.</span>—This sums up the beautiful character to be sought for in the candidates for membership in this chosen woman’s band. She must be known not merely as a mother and a wife, who had well and faithfully performed the womanly duties of her home life, but men must speak of her as one who had diligently and lovingly sought out the rough places of the world, and who, with a brave and patient self-denial, with a sweet and touching self-forgetfulness, had set herself to perform those kind, good actions the Master loves so well.<p>In the <span class= "ital">Shepherd of Hermas, </span>written about A.D. 150, some eighty years after St. Paul wrote this letter to Timothy, we have probably an example of one of these honoured widows in the person of Grapte, whose task it was to teach the widows and orphans of the Roman Church the meaning of certain prophecies. The authorship of the <span class= "ital">Shepherd</span> has also been ascribed to the Hermas mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-14.htm" title="Salute Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermas, Patrobas, Hermes, and the brothers which are with them.">Romans 16:14</a>. It belongs, however, more probably to the middle of the second century, as stated above.<p>The criticism which dwells on this celebrated passage, containing St. Paul’s rules for admission into the order of presbyteral widows, and which finds in it subject matter belonging to a date later than the age of St. Paul and Timothy, forgets that, dating from the days when Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth, women had been enrolling themselves among His foremost followers, and had been sharing in the toils and enterprises of His most zealous disciples. We find the Marys and other holy women associated with “His own” in the days of the earthly ministry; they were foremost in the work done to the person of the sacred dead. We hear of them after the Resurrection repeatedly in the Jerusalem Church of the first days. It was the neglect of some of the Hebrew widows which led to the foundation of the deacon’s order. Dorcas, before ten years of the Church’s life had passed, appears to have presided over a charitable company of women at Lydda. Dorcas, no doubt, was but one out of many doing, in different centres, a similar work. Priscilla, the wife of Aquila, the wandering tent-maker of Pontus, early in St. Paul’s career evidently took a leading part in organising congregations of Christians. Lydia, the purple seller of Thyatira, was prominent in developing the Philippian Church. Phebe, under the title of the Deaconess of Cenchrea, was the official bearer of St. Paul’s famous letter to the Roman Church. This passage, dwelling on the growing organisation for women’s work at Ephesus, tells us more, certainly, than the scattered incidental allusions of the Acts and earlier Epistles. But the words of St. Paul speak only of the natural results and development of a great movement, which, dating from the earthly days of the ministry of Christ, was destined to give women a new position among the workers of the world.<p>The Ephesian organisation here regulated by the Apostle is nothing more than we should expect to find after thirty or thirty-two years of female effort in the Master’s cause.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Well reported of for good works - Of good character or reputation; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-7.htm">1 Timothy 3:7</a>.<p>If she have brought up children - Either her own or others.

There is not the slightest evidence that he refers to it as a religious rite, or ordinance, anymore than he does to the act of bringing up children as a religious rite; compare notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/13-1.htm">John 13:1-10</a>.<p>If she have relieved the afflicted - If it has been her character that she was ready to furnish relief to those who were in distress.<p>If she have diligently followed every good work - This is one of the characteristics of true piety. A sincere Christian will, like God, be the friend of all that is good, and will be ready to promote every good object according to his ability. He will not merely be the friend of one good cause, to the neglect of others, but he will endeavor to promote every good object, and though from special circumstances, and special dealings of Providence, he may have been particularly interested in some one object of charity, yet every good object will find a response in his heart, and he will be ready to promote it by his influence, his property, and his prayers. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. for good works&#8212;Greek, "IN honourable (excellent) works"; the sphere or element in which the good report of her had place (Tit 2:7).

Both by the members of the church, and by them that were without: <p>particularly if she have brought up children; that is, "well", as the Arabic version adds; in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; commanding them, as Abraham did, to keep the way of the Lord, and to do justice and judgment; training them up in the paths of religion and virtue, from which they will not so easily depart when grown up. <p>If she have lodged strangers; as Abraham and Lot did, who entertained angels unawares: this may be understood of strangers in common, but especially of the brethren, ministers, and others, who came from distant parts, and travelled about to spread the Gospel of Christ. The (y) Jews say many things , "in honour of hospitality" or entertaining of strangers, especially of receiving into their houses the disciples of the wise men, and giving them food and drink, and the use of their goods; this was what gave persons a very great character with them, and highly recommended them. <p>If she have washed the saints' feet; which was usual in those hot countries, where they wore sandals only, partly for refreshment, and partly for the removal of dust and filth, contracted in walking; instances of this we have in several places of Scripture, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-4.htm">Genesis 18:4</a>. It was such a common piece of civility, that our Lord complains of the neglect of it towards him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-44.htm">Luke 7:44</a>.

But, indeed, they consider it altogether alien to them (an uncalled for act) to bestow anything on persons unknown and on strangers; or if any case occur seeming to be rather unconnected with them, or a little more remote, to attempt anything in its behalf; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/25-10.htm" title="And Nabal answered David's servants, and said, Who is David? and who is the son of Jesse? there be many servants now a days that break away every man from his master.">1 Samuel 25:10</a>.

The phrase occurs frequently in the pastoral Epistles, both in the singular and in the plural (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-1.htm">1 Timothy 3:1</a>; in this verse; ver. 25; 6:18; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7, 14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1, 8, 14</a>). Our Lord had first used the phrase, and taught how "good works" were to be the distinctive marks of his disciples (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-16.htm">Matthew 5:16</a>), as they were evidences of his own mission (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-32.htm">John 10:32, 33</a>). It denotes all kinds of good <span class="accented">actions</span> as distinguished from <span class="accented">sentiments</span>. Love, <span class="accented">e.g.</span> is not a <span class="accented">good work</span>. Feeding the hungry and clothing the naked and visiting the sick are <span class="accented">good works</span> (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-35.htm">Matthew 25:35</a>, etc.). <span class="cmt_word">Brought up children</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c6;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;</span>); only here in the New Testament or LXX., but found, as well as <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>, in Aristotle. The word must mean "brought up children of her own," because <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f73;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;</span> does not mean "a child" with reference to its age, but "a child" with reference to its parent who bare it. The only apparent exception in Holy Scripture is <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_thessalonians/2-7.htm">1 Thessalonians 2:7</a>, where the nurse's <span class="accented">alumni</span> are called "her own children," but obviously this is no rent exception. The classical usage is the same. We must, therefore, understand the apostle here to mean "if she hath brought up her children well and carefully, and been a good mother to them." The precept corresponds to that laid down for an <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>.

In lxx, the standard word for holy. Its fundamental idea is setting apart, as in Class., devoted to the gods. In O.T., set apart to God, as priests; as the Israelites consecrated to God. In N.T., applied to Christians. Ideally, it implies personal holiness. It is used of God, Christ, John the Baptist, God's law, the Spirit of God. Paul often uses &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#788; &#x3b1;&#788;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3b9; as a common designation of Christians belonging to a certain region or community, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-1.htm">Philippians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-1.htm">2 Corinthians 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-2.htm">Colossians 1:2</a>. In such cases it does not imply actual holiness, but holiness obligatory upon those addressed, as consecrated persons, and appropriate to them. What ought to be is assumed as being.
