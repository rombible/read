In these words there seems a hint that the former life of many of these women-converts to Christianity had been very different to the life loved of Christ, and that in their new profession as Christians there was urgent need of watchfulness on their part not to give any occasion to slanderous tongues.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:3-8 Honour widows that are widows indeed, relieve them, and maintain them. It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels. If professors of the gospel give way to any corrupt principle or conduct, they are worse than those who do not profess to believe the doctrines of grace.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And these things give in charge - Announce, or declare these things, to wit, particularly respecting the duty of children to their widowed mothers, and the proper duty of those who are widows. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. these things&#8212;just now spoken (1Ti 5:5, 6).<p>that they may be blameless&#8212;namely, the widows supported by the Church.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In the discharge of thy ministry declare these things, that all Christians, women especially, may be blameless. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And these things give in charge,....

At the stage reached now by Christianity, the moral life of the believers before the world, ‘such as cannot be laid hold of by anyone,’ is of vital importance for all ranks equally—for the bishop-apostolic himself, for the clergy, for the poor widows. ‘Holiness becometh Thine house’ now most especially.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/5.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm" title="And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.">1 Timothy 5:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ταῦτα</span>, <span class="ital">these things</span>) which have been just now spoken.—<span class="greekheb">ὧσιν</span>, <span class="ital">may be</span>) viz. true widows.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/5.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 7.</span> - <span class="accented">These things also command</span> for <span class="accented">and these things give in charge</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">without reproach</span> for <span class="accented">blameless</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">These things</span>, etc. The apostle had been giving Timothy his own instructions concerning widows and their maintenance by their own relations. He now adds the direction that he should give these things in charge to the Ephesian Church, lest they should be guilty and blameworthy by acting in a different spirit. He probably was aware of a disposition existing in some quarters to throw the burden of maintaining their widows upon the Church. <span class="cmt_word">Without reproach</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#x3c0;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>); above, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, note.
