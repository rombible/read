It is the duty of children, if their parents are in need, and they are able to relieve them, to do it to the utmost of their power. Widowhood is a desolate state; but let widows trust in the Lord, and continue in prayer. All who live in pleasure, are dead while they live, spiritually dead, dead in trespasses and sins. Alas, what numbers there are of this description among nominal Christians, even to the latest period of life! If any men or women do not maintain their poor relations, they in effect deny the faith. If they spend upon their lusts and pleasures, what should maintain their families, they have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels.

Such are not widows indeed; they are not desolate, or alone, or without persons to take care of them; their children or nephews should, and not suffer the church to be burdened with them. Wherefore it follows, <p>let them learn first to show piety at home; which some understand of the widows, who, instead of casting themselves upon the church for a maintenance, or taking upon them the office of a deaconess, to take care of others, should continue in their own families, and bring up their children and nephews in like manner as they have been brought up by their parents, which will be more pleasing and acceptable unto God; but it is better to interpret it of their children; and so the Ethiopic version expresses it, "let the children first learn to do well to their own house", or family. It is the duty of children to take care of their parents in old age, and provide for them, when they cannot for themselves: this is a lesson they ought to learn in the first place, and a duty which they ought principally to observe; they should not suffer them to come to a church for relief, but first take care of them themselves, as long as they are in any capacity to do it; and these should be their first care before any others; so to do is an act of piety, a religious action, a pious one; it is doing according to the will and law of God, and is well pleasing to him: <p>and to requite their parents; for all the sorrow, pain, trouble, care, and expenses they have been at in bearing and bringing them forth into the world, in taking care of them in their infancy, in bringing them up, giving them an education, providing food and raiment for them, and settling them in the world; wherefore to neglect them in old age, when incapable of providing for themselves, would be base ingratitude; whereas to take care of them is but a requital of them, or a repaying them for former benefits had of them: <p>for that is good and acceptable before God; it is good in itself, and grateful, and well pleasing in his sight; it is part of the good, and perfect, and acceptable will of God; and which, as other actions done in faith, is acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/5.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{3}</span> But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to shew piety <span class="cverse3">{4}</span> at home, and <span class="cverse3">{5}</span> to requite their parents: <span class="cverse3">{6}</span> for that is good and acceptable before God.</span><p>(3) Widow's children and nephews must take care of their parents according to their ability.<p>(4) The first reason, because that which they bestow upon their parents, they bestow it upon themselves.<p>(5) Another, because nature itself teaches us to repay our parents.<p>(6) The third: because this duty pleases God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/5.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God....">1 Timothy 5:4-8</a>. There are two opposing views regarding the explanation of this section. (1) The view upheld by the majority of recent commentators, de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt, which is as follows. Paul is giving Timothy instructions to support the “<span class="ital">real</span>” widows. From these he distinguishes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> being in contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a>) the widow who has children or grandchildren, because they are able and ought to care for her. With <span class="greekheb">μανθανέτωσαν</span> we should supply as subject <span class="greekheb">τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα</span>, and we should understand by <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον</span> and <span class="greekheb">τοῖς προγόνοις</span> the widowed mother or grandmother. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> contrasts again with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>; <span class="greekheb">καὶ μεμονωμένη</span> explains the signification of <span class="greekheb">ἡ ὄντως χήρα</span>. The predicate <span class="greekheb">ἤλπικε κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. denotes the life-work which the “right,” <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the forsaken, widow has to fulfil, her fulfilment of it being a necessary condition of receiving support. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm" title="But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.">1 Timothy 5:6</a> declares negatively what conduct the apostle expects from an <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήρα</span>, and to such conduct Timothy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm" title="And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.">1 Timothy 5:7</a>) is to exhort them. At <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, Paul returns to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>, <span class="greekheb">τις</span> referring to the widows’ relations, and <span class="greekheb">τῶν ἰδίων καὶ μάλιστα</span> [<span class="greekheb">τῶν</span>] <span class="greekheb">οἰκείων</span> to the widows themselves.—(2) The view upheld by most older and some recent commentators, especially Matthies and Hofmann, which is as follows. After enjoining on Timothy to honour the “real” widows, Paul first directs the widows who have children or grandchildren (still uncared for), to show these all loving care, and thereby recompense the love shown to themselves by their parents. The subject of <span class="greekheb">μανθανέτωσαν</span> is <span class="greekheb">τις χήρα</span> (as a collective idea); <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον</span> are the children or grandchildren, and <span class="greekheb">οἱ πρόγονοι</span> the dead parents of the widow. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> describes the “real” widow as one who in her loneliness leads a life pious and consecrated to God; and as a contrast to this we have the picture of a wanton widow in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm" title="But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.">1 Timothy 5:6</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>), widows who have relations needing their care are again reminded of the duty of this care.[172]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Each of these views has its difficulties. Against the <span class="ital">second</span> view, the supporters of the first maintain the following points:—(1) that as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> is in contrast with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> in contrast again with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> (<span class="greekheb">δέ</span>), the <span class="greekheb">χήρα</span> spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> cannot be regarded as belonging to the <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήραις</span>; and (2) that as <span class="greekheb">εὐσεβεῖν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>) applies more naturally to the conduct of children towards their mother (or grandmother) than <span class="ital">vice versâ</span>, and as the thought: the widow is by her care for her children to make recompense for the care shown to herself by her parents, is “somewhat far-fetched” (de Wette), the <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήρα</span> can only mean the widow with no relations for whom it is her duty to care.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>But the <span class="ital">first</span> view has also its difficulties. If we adopt it, we find it strange that the apostle should not have written simply <span class="greekheb">αὐτήν</span> for <span class="greekheb">τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον</span>, and <span class="greekheb">αὐτῇ</span> for <span class="greekheb">τοῖς προγόνοις</span>, all the more that <span class="greekheb">οἱ πρόγονοι</span> is a name for “progenitors.” Further, <span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>, which Wiesinger translates inaccurately by “before all,” does not get its full force. It is arbitrary to understand by <span class="greekheb">τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα</span>, <span class="ital">grown-up</span> children, especially as the expression <span class="greekheb">τέκνα ἔχειν</span> makes the children appear dependent on the mother (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1 Timothy 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>). De Wette says regarding <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> : The author would have more clearly said: “Remind a true and forsaken widow to whom thou dost give support, that it falls upon her to show an example of confidence in God and of continual prayer;” but we can hardly think that the apostle would have expressed <span class="ital">this</span> thought in such an uncertain way. Even the three repetitions of the same thought in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a>, is at least very strange. Finally, the idea of money-support, on which this view lays all stress, is purely imported. These difficulties are too considerable for us to regard the <span class="ital">first</span> view as right in spite of them.[173]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>De Wette and Wiesinger are certainly right in regarding <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> as contrasted with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> with <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>, as well as in thinking that the word <span class="greekheb">μεμονωμένη</span> sets forth the apostle’s mark of the <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήρα</span>; but they are not justified in inferring that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a> he is speaking of a widow with relations who can take care of her. Why, in that case, should the apostle in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-5.htm" title="Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, trusts in God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.">1 Timothy 5:5</a> have said regarding the <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήρα</span>, that she was to <span class="greekheb">προσμένειν ταῖς δεήσεσι καὶ ταῖς προσευχαῖς</span>, and to do so <span class="greekheb">νυκτὸς καὶ ἡμέρας</span>, for all this is in no way opposed to what is said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>? The <span class="greekheb">προσμένειν</span> leads us to suppose that the apostle was thinking of a widow who had not to care for relations.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The right view will accordingly be this. After exhorting Timothy to honour the “real” widows (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm" title="Honor widows that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:3</a>), Paul distinguishes from these <span class="greekheb">ὄντως χήραις</span>, in the first place, the one who is <span class="ital">not forsaken</span>, but has children or grandchildren (not grown up); and he lays it on her as a duty not to neglect them. Then he describes the conduct of the “<span class="ital">real</span>” or <span class="ital">forsaken</span> widow, who has therefore no <span class="greekheb">ἴδιον οἶκον</span>, showing what beseems her in her position in life as a Christian widow; so that he is contrasting the widow who works diligently for her own, and the lone widow who continues day and night in prayer. As opposed to the latter (or even to both), he mentions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-6.htm" title="But she that lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.">1 Timothy 5:6</a> the <span class="greekheb">χήρα σπαταλῶσα</span>, who is, however, to be considered as dead, because her conduct is in entire contradiction with her widowed state. Then there is a natural transition to the exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-7.htm" title="And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless.">1 Timothy 5:7</a>, which gives the apostle an opportunity for uttering, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, a general maxim in order to impress once more on the widow with relations to care for, the exhortation in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>. <span class="greekheb">τέκνα ἢ ἔκγονα</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἔκγονα</span> here (in connection with <span class="greekheb">τέκνα</span>) means the “grandchildren” (<span class="greekheb">τέκνα τέκνων</span>, Hesychius).[174] In classical usage, <span class="greekheb">ὁ ἔκγονος</span> is usually the son (<span class="greekheb">ἡ ἔκγονος</span>, the daughter), but also the grandson; <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἔκγονα</span> denotes properly posterity (comp. Wisd. 40:15, 44:11, 45:13, 47:22; synonymous with <span class="greekheb">τὸ σπέρμα</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μανθανέτωσαν</span>] The subject for this verb <span class="ital">might</span> be taken from the object in the protasis; but the formation of the sentence is more correct, if we take the subject of the protasis (<span class="greekheb">τις χήρα</span>) to be the subject here also. <span class="greekheb">Τις χήρα</span> is then a collective idea, and takes the plural. Winer, too (p. 586 [E. T. p. 787]), supports this opinion.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πρῶτον</span>] viz., before they give themselves up to the care of the church for them, with special reference to what follows: <span class="greekheb">χήρα καταλεγέσθω</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1 Timothy 5:9</a>, or better perhaps: “before she makes work for herself outside the house” (Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸν ἴδιον οἶκον εὐσεβεῖν</span>] The term <span class="greekheb">οἶκον</span> likewise shows that he is speaking not of the things which the children are to do for their widowed mother (or grandmother), but of the things which the widows as mothers are to do for the children; because the mother or grandmother does not necessarily belong to the <span class="greekheb">οἶκος</span> of a grown-up son or grandson, whereas the children not grown up necessarily belong to the <span class="greekheb">οἶκος</span> of the widowed mother. The meaning therefore is: they are not to forsake their house, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> their children or grandchildren. The term <span class="greekheb">εὐσεβεῖν</span> is used to show that the house is a temple to whose service they are to devote themselves. Matthies inaccurately translates: “practise piety in regard to one’s own house.” <span class="greekheb">Οἶκον</span> is not the accusative of reference, but purely an objective accusative; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm" title="For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, TO THE UNKNOWN GOD.

Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἀπῆλθον ἐκεῖνοι</span> (<span class="greekheb">οἱ πρόγονοι</span>)· <span class="greekheb">οὐκ ἠδυνήθῃς αὐτοῖς ἀποδοῦναι τὴν ἀμοιβὴν</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἐν τοῖς ἐκγόνοις ἀμειβοῦ</span>· <span class="greekheb">ἀποδίδου τὸ ὀφείλημα διὰ τῶν παίδων</span>.

If it is a little strained to speak of the children learning to shew piety towards their own house when the care of parents or grandparents is meant, it is much more strained to speak of aged widows requiting their parents by the care of their own children or grandchildren. ‘Let the children learn,’ then it should run. In answer to Bp Wordsworth’s objections to this, notice (1) that the Apostle’s whole subject is Christian duty <span class="ital">towards</span> widows, (2) that the repetition in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a></span> is only in keeping with other repetitions of the passage, (3) that the word ‘learn’ here has a clause dependent upon it and so differs in sense from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-13.htm" title="And with they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; and not only idle, but tattlers also and busybodies, speaking things which they ought not.">1 Timothy 5:13</a></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm" title="Let the woman learn in silence with all subjection.">1 Timothy 2:11</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-7.htm" title="Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth.">2 Timothy 3:7</a>, where it is absolute. The plural verb is used, although the subject to be supplied is in the neuter, according to the common N.T. use in the case of persons: e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-21.htm" title="And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the father the child: and the children shall rise up against their parents, and cause them to be put to death.">Matthew 10:21</a>, ‘children shall rise up.’ So the plural verb should be read, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-17.htm" title="Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me; that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.">2 Timothy 4:17</a>, ‘that all the Gentiles might hear.’ Winer, § 58, 3.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to requite</span> their <span class="ital">parents</span>] Lit., ‘to give due returns to their forbears,’ using the old Scotch word, which, as Fairbairn says, exactly corresponds in its including parents and grandparents.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For the phrase ‘to give due returns’ which only occurs in N.

Locke's phrase, "a nephew by a brother," seems to show the transition to the modern use of "nephew."

Trench (Select Glossary) remarks that nephew was undergone exactly the same change of meaning that nepos underwent, which, in the Augustan age, meaning grandson, in the post-Augustan age acquired the signification of nephew in our present acceptation of that word.

Holtzmann thinks the subject is any widow, used collectively. But the writer is treating of what should be done to the widow, not of what she is to do. The admonition is connected with widows indeed. They, as being utterly bereft, and without natural supporters, are to be cared for by the church; but if they have children or grandchildren, these should assume their maintenance.<p>First (&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>In the first place: as their first and natural obligation.<p>To show piety at home (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b9;&#787;&#769;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#787;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;)<p>More correctly, to show piety toward their own family. Piety in the sense of filial respect, though not to the exclusion of the religious sense. The Lat. pietas includes alike love and duty to the gods and to parents. Thus Virgil's familiar designation of Aeneas, "pius Aeneas," as describing at once his reverence for the gods and his filial devotion. The verb &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; (only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-23.htm">Acts 17:23</a>) represents filial respect as an element of godliness (&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;).
