Here the reference belongs exclusively to the younger widows, who (see Note above) were, no doubt, very numerous in a great Asian Church like Ephesus; for the future of these women, often still young and totally unprovided for, St. Paul was very anxious. Until a new home was found for such, of course the Church cared for them, but this heavy burden on the Church’s alms must be lightened as much as possible. It was the plain duty of relatives to care for these in their hour of destitution and sorrow. The Church would have many a one, still comparatively speaking young, utterly dependent on its scanty funds—friendless as well as homeless.<p>It has been asked: How is it that, considering the prominence here given to the questions (<span class= "ital">a</span>) of the support of Christian widows, (<span class= "ital">b</span>) of the rules respecting presbyteral widows, who evidently occupied a position of dignity and importance in the Church of the first days, no other mention of this class in the community (with the exception of <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/6-1.htm" title="And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Grecians against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.">Acts 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/9-39.htm" title="Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.">Acts 9:39</a>) appears in the whole New Testament.<p>This has been pressed as one of the arguments pointing to a much later date for the writing of the Epistle; but the question is, after all, readily and conclusively answered. With the exception of the short Epistle to Titus, the subject of the <span class= "ital">internal</span> organisation of a church is nowhere handled. There is no room or place for such a mention in any of the more exclusively doctrinal or apologetic Epistles. In the broad field of ecclesiastical history occupied by the Acts, the two casual allusions above referred to, in the Churches of Jerusalem and Lydda, tell us of the existence of and the care for these widows in the communities of Christians, even in the earliest years of the Church’s existence.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>5:9-16 Every one brought into any office in the church, should be free from just censure; and many are proper objects of charity, yet ought not to be employed in public services. Those who would find mercy when they are in distress, must show mercy when they are in prosperity; and those who show most readiness for every good work, are most likely to be faithful in whatever is trusted to them. Those who are idle, very seldom are only idle, they make mischief among neighbours, and sow discord among brethren. All believers are required to relieve those belonging to their families who are destitute, that the church may not be prevented from relieving such as are entirely destitute and friendless.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/5.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>If any man or woman that believeth - Christians are often simply called "believers," because faith is the leading and most important act of their religion.<p>Have widows - Widowed mothers, or grandmothers, or any other widows whose support would naturally devolve on them.<p>Let them relieve them - That is, let them support them. This was an obvious rule of duty; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>. Nothing can be more unreasonable than to leave those who are properly dependent on us to be supported by others, when we are able to maintain them ourselves.<p>That it may relieve, ... - That it may have the means of supporting those who are truly dependent. To require or expect the Church, therefore, to support those whom we ought ourselves to support, is, in fact, to rob the poor and friendless. In regard to these directions respecting widows <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-3.htm">1 Timothy 5:3-16</a>, we may remark in general, as the result of the exposition which has been given:<p>(1) they were to be poor widows, who had not the means of support themselves.<p>(2) they were, probably, to be not merely supported, but to be usefully employed in the service of the church, particularly in overseeing the conduct, and imparting instruction to the female members.<p>(3) they were to be of such age and character that there would be security of stability and correctness of deportment; such that they would not be tempted to leave the situation or to act so as to give occasion of reproach.<p>(4) it is by no means certain that this was intended to be a permanent arrangement. It grew probably out of the special customs respecting contact between the sexes in the Oriental world, and would undoubtedly be proper now in similar circumstances. But it by no means follows that this arrangement is binding on the churches where the customs of society are different. Yet.<p>(5) the passage inculcates the general principle that the poor widows of the church are to be assisted when they have no relatives on whom they can naturally depend. No class of people are more helpless than aged widows, and for that class God has always shown a special concern, and his people should do so likewise. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/5.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. If any &#8230; have widows&#8212;of his family, however related to him. Most of the oldest manuscripts and versions omit "man or," and read, "If any woman that believeth." But the Received text seems preferable. If, however, the weightiest authorities are to prevail, the sense will be: He was speaking of younger widows; He now says, If any believing young widow have widows related to her needing support, let her relieve them, thereby casing the Church of the burden, 1Ti 5:3, 4 (there it was the children and grandchildren; here it is the young widow, who, in order to avoid the evils of idleness and wantonness, the result of idleness, 1Ti 5:11, 13; Eze 16:49, is to be diligent in good works, such as "relieving the afflicted," 1Ti 5:10, thus qualifying herself for being afterwards a widow-presbyteress).<p>let them&#8212;rather as Greek, "let him," or "her"; "let such a one" (1Ti 5:10).<p>be charged&#8212;literally, "be burdened" with their support.<p>widows indeed&#8212;really helpless and friendless (1Ti 5:3, 4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/5.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">See Poole on "<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-15.htm" title="For some are already turned aside after Satan.">1 Timothy 5:15</a>"</span> <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/5.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>If any man or woman that believeth have widows,....

According to Heydenreich, Leo, de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, and other expositors, this verse is <span class="ital">in substance</span> a repetition of what was already said in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; but if a right view of those verses be taken, there is not so much repetition.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Hofmann wishes to separate <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a> from what precedes it, as he separates <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a> from the preceding words: “If in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-16.htm" title="If any man or woman that believes have widows, let them relieve them, and let not the church be charged; that it may relieve them that are widows indeed.">1 Timothy 5:16</a> the apostle comes to speak of the case in which the support of a widow is not to fall a burden on the church, this has no reference to the honouring of widows.” There is as little ground for the one separation as for the other; for it is not to be supposed that <span class="greekheb">καταλέγεσθαι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1 Timothy 5:9</a> does not refer to the church’s support.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">εἴ τις πιστὸς ἢ πιστὴ ἔχει χήρας</span>] so runs the <span class="ital">Rec.</span> (Tisch. 7). But the weightiest MSS. have the reading: <span class="greekheb">εἴ τις πιστὴ ἔχει χήρας</span> (Tisch. 8), which is decidedly to be preferred. The other is only a pointless correction, arising from the idea that the husband should be named along with the wife, and without considering that <span class="greekheb">ἤ</span> is by no means suitable to the mention of both together, and that <span class="greekheb">τὶς πιστή</span> must in any case be a Christian <span class="ital">spouse</span>. The reason why the wife and not the husband is named is, that on her was laid the duty of caring for the widows belonging to the house. The <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span> expresses the close connection of the widows with the particular family, a connection which may most naturally be supposed to be one of kin.[186] Erasmus translates it: si qua mater habet filiam viduam; and de Wette, too, supposes that by widow here we are to understand the daughter, niece, etc., not the mother, aunt, etc. This limitation, however, is not contained in the expression itself. Had Paul thought of the relationship in this definite way, he would have expressed himself accordingly.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ μὴ βαρείσθω ἡ ἐκκλησία</span>] let not a charge or burden be laid on the church by undertaking the support of such widows. (The verb belongs to later Greek for the common <span class="greekheb">βαρύνειν</span>; only the form <span class="greekheb">βεβάρημαι</span> is Attic; comp. Butmann, <span class="ital">Ausf.

We may explain it in either of two ways: (1) It not un-frequently happens that the language in which we express a general statement is unconsciously coloured by a particular instance of which we are thinking at the moment. St. Paul has some definite case in his mind, of a Christian woman who had a widow depending on her, of whose support she wishes the Church to relieve her, or (2) the verse may be an afterthought to avoid the possibility of the ruling given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-7.htm" title="And these things give in charge, that they may be blameless....">1 Timothy 5:7-8</a> being supposed to refer to men only.

In what precise way we are to understand this verse is not very clear; whether (1) as a general summary of the whole passage, or (2) as a summary of the portion respecting younger widows inculcating such oversight as might anticipate sinful leanings, or (3) as an extension of the charge to more distant Christian relatives than in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-4.htm" title="But if any widow have children or nephews, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents: for that is good and acceptable before God.">1 Timothy 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm" title="But if any provide not for his own, and specially for those of his own house, he has denied the faith, and is worse than an infidel.">1 Timothy 5:8</a></span>. On the whole, having regard to the way in which the points are put more than once in some fresh aspect, with some degree of repetition, (1) seems best.
