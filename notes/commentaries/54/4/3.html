This teaching was probably, even in those early days, creeping into the churches. The Jewish sects of Essenes and Therapeutæ had already taught that “abstinence from marriage” was meritorious. Men belonging to these sects doubtless were to be found in every populous centre where Jews congregated, and it was always in these centres of Judaism that Christianity at first found a home. St. Paul, however, saw no reason to dwell on this point at any length; the gross absurdity of such a “counsel “as a rule of life was too apparent; it was a plain contradiction of the order of Divine Providence. But the next question which presented itself in the teaching of these false ascetics, as we shall see, required more careful handling.<p><span class= "bld">And commanding to abstain from meats.</span>—Once more we must look to those famous Jewish religious communities of Egypt (the Essenes and Therapeutæ), the precursors of the great monastic systems of Christianity, as the home whence these perverted ascetic tendencies issued. These precepts too, like the counsel respecting marriage, were adopted in after years by several of the principal Gnostic sects; and it was especially those times St. Paul looked on to, although, no doubt, the seeds of their false asceticism had already been sown broadcast in the principal Christian congregations.<p>It has been asked why, in these solemn warnings against a false asceticism which St. Paul foresaw might and would be substituted for a really earnest Godfearing life, the question of celibacy was dismissed with one short sentence, while the apparently less-important question of abstaining from particular kinds of food was discussed with some detail. The reason is easily discoverable. The counsel to abstain from marriage was a strange and unnatural suggestion, one contrary to the plain scheme of creation. Any teaching which taught that the celibate’s life was a life peculiarly pleasing to God would, at the same time, throw a slur upon all home and family life, and the Apostle felt that men’s ordinary common sense would soon relegate any such strange teaching to obscurity; but with the question of abstaining from meats—that was connected with the precepts of the Mosaic law, which dealt at some length (probably from reasons connected with the public health) with these restrictions in the matter of meats.<p>These false teachers, while they urged such abstinence as a likely way to win God’s favour, would probably base, or at all events support, their arguments by reference to certain portions of the Mosaic law, rightly understood or wrongly understood.<p>These points, then, might have risen into the dignity of a controverted question between the (Pauline) Gentile and the Jewish congregations. So St. Paul at once removed it to a higher platform. All food was from the hand of one Maker—nothing, then, could really be considered common or unclean without throwing a slur upon the All-Creator.<p><span class= "bld">Which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving.</span>—God’s primeval intention is thus sharply contrasted with men’s arbitrary restrictions. This divine intention is repeated with still greater emphasis in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-4.htm" title="For every creature of God is good, and nothing to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving:">1Timothy 4:4</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Of them which believe and know the truth.</span>—The true “Gnostics,” in St. Paul’s eyes, were not those self-sufficient men who were out of their own corrupt imagination devising these strange and unnatural methods of pleasing God, but those holy, humble men of heart who <span class= "ital">believed</span> on His crucified Son, and <span class= "ital">knew</span> the truth of the glorious gospel.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a></span>. <span class="ital">Forbidding to marry </span>— The same hypocritical liars, who should promote the worship of demons, should also prohibit lawful marriage. This false morality was very early introduced into the church, being taught first by the Encratites and Marcionites, and afterward by the Manicheans, who said marriage was the invention of the evil god; and who considered it as sinful to bring creatures into the world to be unhappy, and to be food for death. In process of time the monks embraced celibacy, and represented it as the highest pitch of sanctity. It is a thing universally known, that one of the primary and most essential laws and constitutions of all monks, whether solitary or associated, whether living in deserts or in convents, is the profession of a single life, to abstain from marriage themselves, and to discourage it all they can in others. It is equally certain that the monks had the principal share in promoting and propagating the worship of the dead; and either out of credulity, or for worse reasons, recommended it to the people with all the pomp and power of their eloquence in their homilies and orations. At length celibacy was recommended by the priests, and by the orthodox themselves, and more especially by the bishops of Rome, the great patrons of the worship of angels and saints. For they strictly enjoined their clergy, both regular and secular, to abstain from marriage. Thus the worship of demons and the prohibition of marriage, though naturally unconnected, have gone hand in hand in the church, as the Spirit here foretold. <span class="ital">And commanding to abstain from meats </span>— The same lying hypocrites, who enjoined the worship of demons, would not only prohibit lawful marriage, but likewise impose unnecessary abstinence from meats. This part of the prophecy hath been exactly fulfilled; for it is as much the rule of the monks and nuns to abstain from meats as from marriage. Some never eat any flesh, others only of certain kinds, and on certain days. Frequent fasts are the rule, the boast of their order; and their carnal humility is their spiritual pride. So lived the monks of the ancient church; so live, with less strictness, perhaps, but with greater ostentation, the monks and friars of the Church of Rome: and these have been the principal propagators and defenders of the worship of the dead, both in former and in latter times. Here therefore the apostle hath pointed out two instances of the hypocrisy of the lying teachers, who should enjoin the worship of demons. Under the false pretence of holiness, they should recommend abstinence from marriage to the monks, friars, and nuns; and under the equally false pretence of devotion, they should enjoin abstinence from meats, to some men at all times, and to all men at some times. There is no necessary connection between the worship of demons and abstinence from marriage and meats. And yet it is certain that the great advocates of this worship have commanded both: and by this pretended purity and mortification have procured the greater reverence to their persons, and the readier reception of their doctrine: a proceeding this which the Spirit of God alone could have foreseen and foretold. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">Which </span>meats <span class="ital">God hath created to be received with thanksgiving </span>— So that this Popish, monkish abstinence is as unworthy of a Christian, as it is unnatural to man. It is perverting the purpose of the Author of nature, and prohibiting the use of the creatures which he hath made, and given to be used <span class="ital">of them who believe and obey the truth </span>— Here the apostle intimates that only true believers have a covenant right to the creatures of God, though others may have a providential right. By <span class="ital">those, </span>however, <span class="ital">who know the truth, </span>he may chiefly intend those who are instructed to place religion not in such indifferent things as abstaining from marriage, or from certain meats, but in things more truly excellent and worthy of God, and who know that all meats are now clean, and therefore may be used with a pure conscience, and with thanksgiving flowing therefrom. <span class="ital">For every creature of God </span>— Fit for man’s food; <span class="ital">is good </span>— Lawful to be used, <span class="ital">and nothing to be refused</span> — <span class="greekheb">Αποβλητον</span>, <span class="ital">to be rejected, </span>or <span class="ital">cast away, </span>either from peevishness, or a fancy that it is unlawful; <span class="ital">if it be received with thanksgiving </span>— Which is a necessary condition. <span class="ital">For it is sanctified </span>— That is, under the gospel all meats are made lawful to us; <span class="ital">by the word of God </span>— Allowing us to eat of every kind in moderation; <span class="ital">and </span>by <span class="ital">prayer </span>— To God, that he would bless us in the use of it. Observe, reader, the children of God are to pray for the sanctification of all the creatures which they use, and to give thanks for them: and not only the Christians, but even the Jews, yea, the very heathen, used to consecrate their table by prayer and praise. “What then,” says Bishop Newton, “can be said of those who have their tables spread with the most plentiful gifts of God, and yet constantly sit down and rise up again without suffering so much as one thought of the Giver to intrude upon them? Can such persons be reputed either to believe or know the truth?”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God. This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Forbidding to marry - That is, "They will depart from the faith through the hypocritical teaching - of those who forbid to marry;" see notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>. This does not necessarily mean that they would prohibit marriage altogether, but that it would be a characteristic of their teaching that marriage would "be forbidden," whether of one class of persons or many. They would "commend" and "enjoin" celibacy and virginity. They would regard such a state, for certain persons, as more holy than the married condition, and would consider it as "so" holy that they would absolutely prohibit those who wished to be most holy from entering into the relation. It is needless to say how accurately this applies to the views of the papacy in regard to the comparative purity and advantages of a state of celibacy, and to their absolute prohibition of the marriage of the clergy. The tenth article of the decree of the Council of Trent, in relation to marriage, will show the general view of the papacy on that subject. "Whosoever shall say that the married state is to be preferred to a state of virginity, or celibacy, and that it is not better and more blessed to remain in virginity, or celibacy, than to be joined in marriage; let him be accursed!" Compare Peter Dens' Moral Theology, pp. 497-500.<p>And commanding to abstain from meats, ... - The word "meat" in the Scriptures, commonly denotes "food" of all kinds; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-4.htm">Matthew 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-10.htm">Matthew 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-37.htm">Matthew 15:37</a>. This was the meaning of the word when the translation of the Bible was made. It is now used by us, almost exclusively, to denote animal food. The word here used - &#x3b2;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;  bro&#772;ma - means, properly, whatever is eaten, and may refer to animal flesh, fish, fruit, or vegetables. It is often, however, in the New Testament, employed particularly to denote the flesh of animals; Heb, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-10.htm">Matthew 9:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/13-9.htm">Matthew 13:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/14-15.htm">Romans 14:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-20.htm">Romans 14:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-8.htm">1 Corinthians 8:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-13.htm">1 Corinthians 8:13</a>. As it was animal food particularly which was forbidden under the Jewish code, and as the questions on this subject among Christians would relate to the same kinds of prohibition, it is probable that the word has the same limited signification here, and should be taken as meaning the same thing that the word "meat" does with us.<p>To forbid the use of certain meats, is here described as one of the characteristics of those who would instruct the church in the time of the great apostasy. It is not necessary to suppose that there would be an "entire" prohibition, but only a prohibition of certain kinds, and at certain seasons. That "this" characteristic is found in the papacy more than anywhere else in the Christian world, it is needless to prove. The following questions and answers from Dr. Butler's Catechism, will show what is the sentiment of Roman Catholics on this subject. "Question: Are there any other commandments besides the Ten Commandments of God? Answer: There are the commandments or precepts of the church, which are chiefly six. Question: What are we obliged to do by the second commandment of the church? Answer: To give part of the year to fast and abstinence. Question: What do you mean by fast-days? Answer: Certain days on which we are allowed but one meal, and "forbidden flesh meat."<p>Question: What do you mean by days of abstinence? Answer: Certain days on which we are forbidden to eat flesh meat; but are allowed the usual number of meals. Question: Is it strictly forbidden by the church to eat flesh meat on days of abstinence? Answer: Yes; and to eat flesh meat on any day on which it is forbidden, without necessity and leave of the church, is very sinful." Could there be a more impressive and striking commentary on what the apostle says here, that "in the latter days some would depart from the faith, under the hypocritical teaching of those who commanded to abstain from meats?" The authority claimed by the papacy to issue "commands" on this subject, may be seen still further by the following extract from the same catechism, showing the gracious permission of the church to the "faithful." "The abstinence on Saturday is dispensed with, for the faithful throughout the United States, for the space of ten years (from 1833), except when a fast falls on a Saturday. The use of flesh meat is allowed at present by dispensation in the diocess of Philadelphia, on all the Sundays of Lent, except Palm Sunday, and once a day on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday in each week, except the Thursday after Ash Wednesday, and also excepting Holy-week." Such is the Roman Catholic religion! See also Peter Dens' Moral Theology, pp. 321-330. It is true that what is said here "might" apply to the Essenes, as Koppe supposes, or to the Judaizing teachers, but it applies more appropriately and fully to the Papal communion than to any other body of men professing Christianity, and taken in connection with the other characteristics of the apostasy, there can be no doubt that the reference is to that.<p>Which God hath created - The articles of food which he has made, and which he has designed for the nourishment of man. The fact that God had "created" them was proof that they were not to be regarded as evil, and that it was not to be considered as a religious duty to abstain from them. All that "God" has made is good in its place, and what is adapted to be food for man is not to be refused or forbidden; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-18.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:18</a>. There can be no doubt that in the apostasy here referred to, those things would be forbidden, not because they were injurious or hurtful in their nature, but because it might be made a part of a system of religion of self-righteousness and because there might be connected with such a prohibition the belief of special merit. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3. Sensuality leads to false spiritualism. Their own inward impurity is reflected in their eyes in the world without them, and hence their asceticism (Tit 1:14, 15) [Wiesinger]. By a spurious spiritualism (2Ti 2:18), which made moral perfection consist in abstinence from outward things, they pretended to attain to a higher perfection. Mt 19:10-12 (compare 1Co 7:8, 26, 38) gave a seeming handle to their "forbidding marriage" (contrast 1Ti 5:14); and the Old Testament distinction as to clean and unclean, gave a pretext for teaching to "abstain from meats" (compare Col 2:16, 17, 20-23). As these Judaizing Gnostics combined the harlot or apostate Old Testament Church with the beast (Re 17:3), or Gnostic spiritualizing anti-Christianity, so Rome's Judaizing elements (1Ti 4:3) shall ultimately be combined with the open worldly-wise anti-Christianity of the false prophet or beast (1Ti 6:20, 21; Col 2:8; 1Jo 4:1-3; Re 13:12-15). Austerity gained for them a show of sanctity while preaching false doctrine (Col 2:23). Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 4.29] quotes from Iren&aelig;us [1.28] a statement that Saturninus, Marcion, and the Encratites preached abstinence from marriage and animal meats. Paul prophetically warns against such notions, the seeds of which already were being sown (1Ti 6:20; 2Ti 2:17, 18).<p>to be received&#8212;Greek, "to be partaken of."<p>of them&#8212;literally, (created and designed) "for them," Though all (even the unbelieving, Ps 104:14; Mt 5:45) are partakers in these foods created by God, "they which believe" alone fulfil God's design in creation by partaking of them with thanksgiving; as opposed to those who abstain from them, or in partaking of them, do not do so with thanksgiving. The unbelieving have not the designed use of such foods by reason of their "conscience being defiled" (Tit 1:15). The children of God alone "inherit the earth"; for obedience is the necessary qualification (as it was in the original grant of the earth to Adam), which they alone possess.<p>and know the truth&#8212;explanatory and defining who are "they which believe." Translate as Greek, "and have full knowledge of the truth" (see on [2474]Php 1:9). Thus he contradicts the assumption of superior knowledge and higher moral perfection, put forward by the heretics, on the ground of their abstinence from marriage and meats. "The truth" stands in opposition to their "lies" (1Ti 4:2).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Forbidding to marry:</span> the Greek is, hindering to marry, but that might be by forbidding it by a law under a severe penalty.

How applicable therefore soever this might be to the Ebionites, and those that followed Saturninus and Marcion, and the Encratitae, (which the papists contend for), it certainly more nearly concerns the papists themselves, who more universally forbade them to their clergy, and were the first that had a power to hinder them, and fell into much later times than any of the others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And commanding to abstain from meats; </span> to abstain from some meats; and this also they should teach in hypocrisy, i.e. under a pretence of piety.

In the Epistle to the Romans (chap. 14) the apostle speaks of weak brethren’s anxiety in regard to the enjoyment of many meats, and the heretics combated in the Epistle to the Colossians are distinctly described as forbidding the enjoyment of certain meats; but neither here nor in these passages is it said what kinds of meat were forbidden, nor why (comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/1-14.htm" title="Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men, that turn from the truth....">Titus 1:14-15</a>). It is, however, not improbable—if we follow the analogy of later gnostics—that animal food, and perhaps also wine (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-6.htm" title=" As you have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk you in him:">Colossians 2:6</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν βρώσει ἢ ἐν πόσει</span>), are specially meant. There is no indication that the prohibition was founded on gnostic dualism (van Oosterzee); it is more probable that the false asceticism of the heretics was connected with the Mosaic distinction between clean and unclean (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-15.htm" title="To the pure all things are pure: but to them that are defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind and conscience is defiled.">Titus 1:15</a>); so also Wiesinger.[155]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the Epistle to the Colossians (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-22.htm" title=" Which all are to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men?">Colossians 2:22</a>) the apostle indicates the perversity of such a prohibition in a brief relative clause; and so also here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἃ ὁ Θεὸς ἔκτισεν εἰς μετάληψιν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] Different answers have been given to the question why only the second, and not also the first error is refuted. It may have been that the heretics did not make abstinence from marriage, as they made abstinence from certain meats, a command laid on all. It may have been, too, “that the prohibition to marry stood in manifest contradiction with the divine order of creation, whereas the prohibition of certain meats might appear less objectionable because of its analogy with the prohibition in the law of Moses” (Hofmann). Besides, the apostle has already indicated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing, if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety.">1 Timothy 2:15</a> the opposition of the gospel to this prohibition to marry.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="greekheb">μετάληψις</span> occurs only here, though in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-33.htm" title="And while the day was coming on, Paul sought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.">Acts 27:33</a> we find <span class="greekheb">μεταλαβεῖν τροφῆς</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apostle does not content himself with saying that God made food to be enjoyed, but he shows at the same time how God meant it to be enjoyed, viz.: <span class="greekheb">μετὰ εὐχαριστίας</span> (comp. on this <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-31.htm" title="Whether therefore you eat, or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.">1 Corinthians 10:31</a>). He then limits the general thought by a special reference to believers: <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστοῖς καὶ ἐπεγνωκόσι τὴν ἀλήθειαν</span>, as those in whom the purpose of creation is fulfilled, solis filiis suis Deus totum mundum et quicquid in mundo est destinavit, qua ratione etiam vocantur mundi heredes (Calvin). The apostle’s thought is distorted by adding “also” before <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστοῖς</span>, as is done by some expositors.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Heydenreich rightly says that the words are equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἵνα οἱ πιστοὶ καὶ οἱ ἐπεγνωκότες τὴν ἀληθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">μεταλαβῶσιν αὐτῶν μετὰ εὐχαριστίας</span>. Hofmann unjustifiably takes exception to this, and—in spite of <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> beginning a new sentence—seeks to connect <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστοῖς</span> not with what goes before, but with what follows (!). The added words: <span class="greekheb">τοῖς πιστοῖς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., show most clearly the perverse conduct of the heretics in forbidding the enjoyment, and to believers of all people. <span class="greekheb">Πιστοί</span> are “believers,” and not “those convinced that enjoyment is permitted to them;” <span class="greekheb">ἐπεγν</span>. <span class="greekheb">τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθ</span>. also does not denote a special class of the <span class="greekheb">πιστῶν</span>: “the Christians who have come to the true gnosis” (as Heydenreich thinks probable), but the <span class="greekheb">πιστοί</span> themselves, as those who, in contrast to the heretics, have recognised the truth, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the divine truth. <span class="greekheb">Καί</span> is epexegetical; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-4.htm" title="Who will have all men to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth.">1 Timothy 2:4</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[155] Hofmann, with no good reason, declares, on the other hand, that attention is directed here to the Essenes and Therapeutae, and to the weak Christians mentioned in the Epistle to the Romans, as well as to the heretics at Colosse.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/4.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων γαμεῖν</span>: Spurious asceticism, in this and other departments of life, characterised the Essenes (Joseph. <span class="ital">Bell.

Theophylact inserts similarly <span class="greekheb">συμβουλευόντων</span>. Hort conjectures that <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι</span> is a primitive corruption for <span class="greekheb">ἢ ἅπτεσθαι</span> or <span class="greekheb">καὶ γεύεσθαι</span>. He maintains that “no Greek usage will justify or explain this combination of two infinitives, adverse to each other in the tenor of their sense, under the one verb <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span>; and their juxtaposition without a conjunction in a sentence of this kind is at least strange”.

The answer seems to be that the same general argument applies to both. The final cause of both is the same, <span class="ital">i.e.</span>, to keep the race alive; and man is not entitled to place restrictions on the use of either, other than those which can be shown to be in accordance with God’s law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μετάλημψιν μετὰ εὐχαριστίας</span> is one complex conception. This expresses the ideal use, truly dignified and human, of food. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/14-6.htm" title="He that regards the day, regards it to the Lord; and he that regards not the day, to the Lord he does not regard it.

He who makes His sun to rise on the evil is certainly well pleased to make it rise on the good.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Again, St. Paul does not merely desire to vindicate the use of some of God’s creatures for them that believe, but the use of <span class="ital">all</span> of God’s creatures, so far as they are not physically injurious. “God saw <span class="ital">every thing</span> that he had made, and behold, it was very good,” <span class="greekheb">καλὰ λίαν</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-31.htm" title="And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good.

From the verb ‘forbidding’ must be supplied by the rule called <span class="ital">zeugma</span> (Winer, § 661 e), the positive ‘bidding’ with the infinitive ‘to abstain from meats.’ ‘Meats’ is to be understood in its older sense ‘food for eating,’ though abstinence from <span class="ital">animal food</span> was the distinctive rule of the developed Gnostic systems, such as that of the Encratites or Purists under Tatian.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know</span>] The comma of A.V. (Parallel N.T.) after ‘believe’ (though inserted to prevent its being understood to mean ‘believe the truth’) has been omitted by R.V., apparently because there is only one article for the two clauses, and therefore they describe the same people under slightly different aspects: while the insertion might seem to make a higher class <span class="ital">among</span> those that believe, viz. those that know the truth fully, and to give the privilege of thus partaking to it only.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word for ‘know’ is most exactly <span class="bld">have come to full knowledge of</span>, and implies that full experience of God’s will and ways which is open to all who have become ‘adherents of the faith,’ ‘faithful.’ Cf. note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1 Timothy 3:4</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/4.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a>. <span class="greekheb">Κωλυόντων γαμεῖν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἀπέχεσθαι βρωμάτων</span>, <span class="ital">forbidding to marry—to abstain from meats</span>) The hypocritical appearance of false doctrines, very austere and plausible, which gains a show for all the rest of their dogmas (giving colour to them in the eyes of the dupes), is here expressed: comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-23.htm" title=" Which things have indeed a show of wisdom in will worship, and humility, and neglecting of the body: not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.">Colossians 2:23</a>.

To marry</span> and <span class="ital">to abstain</span> are construed with <span class="ital">commanding;</span> the negative belongs only to the expression, <span class="ital">to marry</span>.

He considers it enough here merely to mention that respecting <span class="ital">marriage</span> (unless the <span class="greekheb">ἅ</span>, <span class="ital">which</span>, that follows, is to be referred to this also), and he refutes it also below, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1 Timothy 5:14</a>.—<span class="greekheb">βρωμάτων</span>, <span class="ital">meats</span>) They shall not forbid all kinds of meats (therefore the article is not added); for who would listen to such prohibitions? therefore it is only some kinds that they forbid. Also it is implied here, that he who forbids even one kind does a wrong to his Creator and to believers.

His meal consisted of a piece of bread, and a single mess of vegetables" ('Introd.,' p. 86). Professor Burton (in Kitto's 'Cyclopaedia,' art.

Commanding is not expressed, but is implied in forbidding; "Bidding not to marry and (bidding) to abstain from meats." The ascetic tendencies indicated by these prohibitions developed earlier than these Epistles among the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish brotherhood on the shores of the Dead Sea, who repudiated marriage except as a necessity for preserving the race, and allowed it only under protest and under stringent regulations. They also abstained strictly from wine and animal food. This sect was in existence in the lifetime of our Lord. Strong traces of its influence appear in the heresy assailed in Paul's Epistle to the Colossians. The Christian body received large accessions from it after the destruction of Jerusalem (70 a.d.).
