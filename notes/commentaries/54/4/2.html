These men tried to teach the efficacy of a substitution of certain counsels of perfection in place of a faithful loving life. They based their teaching on wild Oriental speculations about the evil nature of all matter. They were often themselves evil-livers, who, conscious of their own stained, scarred lives, strove with a show of outward sanctity and hypocritical self-denial to beguile and to lead astray others, and in the end to make them as vile as themselves.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/4.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;">1 Timothy 4:2</a></span>. <span class="ital">Speaking lies in hypocrisy </span>— Greek, <span class="greekheb">εν υποκρισει ψευδολογων</span>, <span class="ital">by the hypocrisy of them that speak lies. </span>This is a more literal, and at the same time a more just translation of the words than that given in our Bible, which represents the demons as speaking lies in hypocrisy, which could not be the apostle’s meaning, as it would not accord with what follows. <span class="ital">Having their conscience seared, </span>&c. — An expression which could not be intended of devils.

How well the appellation agrees to the Romish clergy in the dark ages, any one may understand who is acquainted with the lies then propagated concerning the apparitions of angels, and of the ghosts of departed saints; and concerning the miracles done by them, and by their relics, and by the sign of the cross, &c., all preached by monks, priests, and even bishops; and committed to writing, in the fabulous legends of their saints, to render them objects of adoration. “It is impossible,” says Bishop Newton, “to relate or enumerate all the various falsehoods and lies which have been invented and propagated for this purpose; the fabulous books forged under the names of apostles, saints, and martyrs; the fabulous legends of their lives, actions, sufferings, and deaths; the fabulous miracles ascribed to their sepulchres, bones, and other relics; the fabulous dreams and revelations, visions, and apparitions of the dead to the living; and even the fabulous saints who never existed but in the imagination of their worshippers: and all these stories the monks, the priests, the bishops of the church, have imposed and obtruded upon mankind, it is difficult to say, whether with greater artifice or cruelty, with greater confidence or hypocrisy, and pretended sanctity, a more hardened face, or a more hardened conscience.

This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Speaking lies in hypocrisy - &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  en hupokrisei pseudologo&#772;n. Or rather, "by, or through the hypocrisy of those speaking lies. So it is rendered by Whitby, Benson, Macknight, and others. Our translators have rendered it as if the word translated "speaking lies" - &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  pseudologo&#772;n - referred to "demons," or, "devils," &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  daimonio&#772;n - in the previous verse. But there are two objections to this. One is, that then, as Koppe observes, the words would have been inverted - &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;  pseudologo&#772;n en hupokrisei. The other is, that if that construction is adopted, it must be carried through the sentence, and then all the phrases "speaking lies," "having their conscience seared," "forbidding to marry," etc., must be referred to demons. The preposition &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;  en, "in" may denote "by" or "through," and is often so used.<p>If this be the true construction, then it will mean that those who departed from the faith did it "by" or "through" the hypocritical teachings of those who spoke lies, or who knew that they were inculcating falsehoods; of those whose conscience was seared; of those who forbade to marry, etc. The meaning then will be, "In the last days certain persons will depart from the faith of the gospel. This apostasy will essentially consist in their giving heed to spirits that lead to error, and in embracing corrupt and erroneous views on demonology, or in reference to invisible beings between us and God. This they will do through the hypocritical teaching of those who inculcate falsehood; whose consciences are seared," etc. The series of characteristics, therefore, which follow, are those of the "teachers," not of "the taught;" of the ministers of the church, not of the great body of the people.<p>The apostle meant to say that this grand apostasy would occur under the influence of a hypocritical, hardened, and arbitrary ministry, teaching their own doctrines instead of the divine commands, and forbidding that which God had declared to be lawful. In the clause before us - "speaking lies in hypocrisy" - two things are implied, "first," that the characteristic of those referred to would be that they would "speak lies;" "second," that this would be done "hypocritically." In regard to the first, there can be no doubt among Protestants of its applicability to the papal communion. The entire series of doctrines respecting the authority of the Pope, purgatory, the mass, the invocation of the saints, the veneration of relics, the seven sacraments, the authority of tradition, the doctrine of merit, etc., is regarded as false. Indeed, the system could not be better characterized than by saying that it is a system "speaking lies." The entire scheme attempts to palm falsehood upon the world, in the place of the simple teaching of the New Testament. The only question is, whether this is done "in hypocrisy," or hypocritically. In regard to this, it is not necessary to maintain that there is "no" sincerity among the ministers of that communion, or that "all" are hypocritical in their belief and their teaching. The sense is, that this is the general characteristic, or that this is understood by the leaders or prime movers in that apostasy. In regard to the applicability of this to the ministers of the Papal communion, and the question whether they teach what they know to be false, we may observe:<p>(1) that many of them are men of eminent learning, and there can he no reason to doubt that they Know that many of the Catholic legends are false, and many of the doctrines of their faith contrary to the Bible.<p>(2) not a few of the things in that communion must be known by them to be false, though not known to be so by the people. Such are all the pretended miracles performed by the relics of the saints; the liquefying of the blood of Januarius, etc.; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-9.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:9</a>. As the working of these tricks depends wholly on the priesthood, they must know that they are "speaking lies in hypocrisy."<p>(3) the matter of fact seems to be, that when young men who have been trained in the Catholic Church, first turn their attention to the ministry, they are sincere. They have not yet been made acquainted with the "mysteries of iniquity" in the communion in which they have been trained, and they do not suspect the deceptions that are practiced there. When they pass through their course of study, however, and become acquainted with the arts and devices on which the fabric rests, and with the scandalous lives of many of the clergy, they are shocked to find how corrupt and false the whole system is. But they are now committed. They have devoted their lives to this profession. They are trained now to this system of imposture, and they must continue to practice and perpetuate the fraud, or abandon the church, and subject themselves to all the civil and ecclesiastical disabilities which would now follow if they were to leave and reveal all its frauds and impostures. A gentleman of high authority, and who has had as good an opportunity as any man living to make accurate and extensive observations, stated to me, that this was a common thing in regard to the Catholic clergy in France and Italy. No one can reasonably doubt that the great body of that clergy "must" be apprized that much that is relied on for the support of the system is mere legend, and that the miracles which are pretended to be performed are mere trick and imposture.<p>Having their conscience seared with a hot iron - The allusion here is doubtless to the effect of applying a hot iron to the skin. The cauterized part becomes rigid and hard, and is dead to sensibility. So with the conscience of those referred to. It has the same relation to a conscience that is sensitive and quick in its decisions, that a cauterized part of the body has to a thin, delicate, and sensitive skin. Such a conscience exists in a mind that will practice delusion without concern; that will carry on a vast system of fraud without wincing; that will incarcerate, scourge, or burn the innocent without compassion; and that will practice gross enormities, and indulge in sensual gratifications under the mask of piety. While there are many eminent exceptions to an application of this to the Papal communion, yet this description will apply better to the Roman priesthood in the time of Luther - and in many other periods of the world - than to any other "body of men" that ever lived. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. Rather translate, "Through (literally, 'in'; the element in which the apostasy has place) the hypocrisy of lying speakers"; this expresses the means through which "some shall (be led to) depart from the faith," namely, the reigned sanctity of the seducers (compare "deceivers," Tit 1:10).<p>having their conscience seared&#8212;Greek, "having their own conscience," &c., that is, not only "speaking lies" to others, but also having their own conscience seared. Professing to lead others to holiness, their own conscience is all the while defiled. Bad consciences always have recourse to hypocrisy. As faith and a good conscience are joined (1Ti 1:5); so hypocrisy (that is, unbelief, Mt 24:5, 51; compare Lu 12:46) and a bad conscience here. Theodoret explains like English Version, "seared," as implying their extreme insensibility; the effect of cauterizing being to deaden sensation. The Greek, however, primarily means "branded" with the consciousness of crimes committed against their better knowledge and conscience, like so many scars burnt in by a branding iron: Compare Tit 1:15; 3:11, "condemned of himself." They are conscious of the brand within, and yet with a hypocritical show of sanctity, they strive to seduce others. As "a seal" is used in a good sense (2Ti 2:19), so "a brand" in a bad sense. The image is taken from the branding of criminals.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The words, as translated by us, are very difficult; for the word which we translate <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">speaking lies, </span> being the genitive case, will neither agree with <span class="ital">spirits</span> nor <span class="ital">doctrines, </span> in the former verse, they being both the dative: but neither is our translation agreeable to the Greek, which is thus: In or through the hypocrisy of such as speak lies, and of such as have a conscience seared with a hot iron; which doubtless is the sense; so the words explain the manner how they were seduced to apostacy, viz. through the hypocrisy or dissimulation of men that speak lies, and had consciences benumbed, and mortified, as it were cauterized and seared with a hot iron. By their hypocrisy he characterizes seducers, uncertain, false men, that regarded not what they said, but made a show and appearance of piety, when indeed they had no sense of piety in them. By men whose <span class="bld">consciences</span> were <span class="bld">seared with a hot iron, </span> he means persons so far from any sense of piety, that they were hardened to any degree of iniquity: and indeed by both terms he excellently expresseth such persons as generally they are who seduce others to false doctrine, they could not do it without some show or pretence of piety, they would not do it if they had any true sense of it; and by both terms he too well expresseth those that in our days seduce men to the doctrines concerning demons, and abstaining from marriage and meats, which are those doctrines he alone instanceth in. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Speaking lies in hypocrisy,.... Or "through the hypocrisy of those that speak lies"; for the apostle is still speaking of the means by which the apostasy should rise, and get ground; and it should be by the means of persons that should deliver lying or false doctrine under the colour of truth, and make great pretensions to religion and holiness, which would greatly take with men, and captivate and lead them aside: and this plainly points at the abettors of antichrist, the Romish priests, who deliver out the lying doctrines of merit, purgatory, invocation of saints, fastings, pilgrimages, &amp;c. and the fabulous legends of saints, and the lying wonders and miracles done by them, and all under a show of godliness, and the promoting of religion and holiness: <p>having their conscience seared with a hot iron; which exactly describes the above mentioned persons, whose consciences are cauterized and hardened, and past feeling; and have no regard to what they say or do, make no conscience of anything, but under a cloak of sanctity commit the most shocking impieties; and are men of the most infamous characters, and of the most enormous and scandalous lives and conversations; so that the metaphor may be taken either from the searing of flesh with an iron, or cauterizing it, whereby it grows callous and hard; or from the stigmas or marks which used to be put on malefactors, or such who have been guilty of notorious crimes. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{2}</span> Speaking lies in <span class="cverse3">{b}</span> hypocrisy; having their <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> conscience seared with a hot iron;</span><p>(2) Even though heretics pretend holiness ever so much, yet they have no conscience.<p>(b) For they will as it were practise the art of disguised persons and players, so that we may not think they will lie lurking in some one corner or keep any resemblance of being shameful.<p>(c) Whose conscience became so hard, that there grew a callous over it, and so became to have a canker in it, and now at length required by very necessity to be burned with a hot iron.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm" title="Speaking lies in hypocrisy; having their conscience seared with a hot iron;">1 Timothy 4:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων</span>] Leo: “errarunt sine dubio, qui genitivos, qui sequuntur, <span class="greekheb">ψευδολόγων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κεκαυτηριασμένων</span>, <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span>, lege appositionis, junctos esse dicebant cum voc. <span class="greekheb">δαιμονίων</span>;” but we must also reject Leo’s opinion, that <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑποκρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ψευδ</span>. was added to the previous statement as a second characteristic of the heretics, meaning: eadem simulantes, quae simulare solent homines <span class="greekheb">ψευδολόγοι</span>, etc.; <span class="greekheb">ψευδολ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κεκαυτηρ</span>., <span class="greekheb">κωλυόντων</span> denote the heretics themselves, and not those whom they imitated.

Nor can Luther’s translation be defended: “by means of such as are speakers of lies in hypocrisy.” <span class="greekheb">Ἐν ὑποκρίσει</span> is either to be taken with <span class="greekheb">ἀποστήσονται</span> (so Bengel: Constr. cum deficient; hypocrisis ea, quae est falsiloquorum, illos auferet; <span class="greekheb">τινες</span> aliqui, illi, sunt seducti; falsiloqui, seductores; falsiloquorum, genitivus, unice pendet ab hypocrisi), or, still better, with <span class="greekheb">προσέχοντες</span> (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt). The objection of Matthies, which agrees with Leo’s explanation, that in that case we should have had instead of <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> either <span class="greekheb">διά</span> or <span class="greekheb">ἕνεκα</span> with the article, is contradicted by the usage of the N.

Hofmann strangely combines <span class="greekheb">δαιμονίων ἐν ὑποκρίσει ψευδολόγων</span> into one idea, explaining <span class="greekheb">δαιμονίων</span> to be an adjective with <span class="greekheb">ψευδολόγων</span>, and <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑποκρίσει</span> also as a qualification of <span class="greekheb">ψευδολόγων</span> in the sense of “hypocritical.”[154]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The hypocrisy of the heretics consisted in giving themselves, in obedience to a false spiritualism (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a>), the appearance of a spiritually-inspired life.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The word <span class="greekheb">ψευδολόγοι</span>, (“liars,” Luther) occurs only here in the N.

As these bore the brand on their forehead,—that is the figurative expression,—so do the heretics bear it on their conscience, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> they bear in their conscience the knowledge of their guilt.

But then the clause, "having their conscience seared with a hot iron," does not suit "devils." It is therefore, perhaps, best to translate the clause as the R.V. does, and to explain, with Bishop Ellicott, that the preposition <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, which precedes <span class="greek">&#x1f51;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;</span>, defines the <span class="accented">instrument</span> by which they were led to give heed to seducing spirits, viz. the hypocritical preterites of the men who spake lies, and whose consciences were seared. If <span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span> agrees with <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;</span>, we must conceive that St. Paul passes insensibly from "<span class="accented">the</span> devils" to the false teachers who spake as they taught them. In the Gospels, the speech of the devils, and of those possessed by devils, is often interchanged, as <span class="accented">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33, 34, 41</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-23.htm">Mark 1:23, 24</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Men that speak lies</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;</span>); only found here in the New Testament, but occasionally in classical Greek.

The application of the image is somewhat uncertain. If the idea is that of "a brand," a mark burnt in upon the forehead of a slave or criminal, then the meaning is that these men have their own infamy stamped upon their own consciences. It is not patent only to others, but to themselves also. But if the metaphor is from the cauterizing a wound, as the A.V. takes it, then the idea is that these men's consciences are become as insensible to the touch as the skin that has been cauterized is. The metaphor, in this case, is somewhat similar to that of <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c9;&#x3c1;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f7d;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/3-5.htm">Mark 3:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/6-52.htm">Mark 6:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-40.htm">John 12:40</a>, etc.). The latter interpretation seems to suit the general context best, and the medical use of the term, which St. Paul might have learnt from Luke. The emphasis of <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f30;&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>, "their own conscience," implies that they were not merely deceivers of others, but were self-deceived. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/4.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Speaking lies in hypocrisy (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c5;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3ba;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9; &#x3c8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;)<p>Wrong.
