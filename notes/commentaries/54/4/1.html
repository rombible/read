The “words of the Spirit” here allude to a mysterious power, to a divine gift, traces of which occur again and again in the New Testament pages. Among the supernatural signs which were vouchsafed to the first generation of believers, and with very rare exceptions only to the first generation—to men and women, many, if not most, of whom had seen Jesus, and had had personal contact with Him—must be reckoned those mysterious intimations of the will of the Holy Spirit which guided and encouraged the Church of the first days. That intimation came in varied forms: to the Twelve in the form of fiery tongues (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/2-1.htm" title="And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all with one accord in one place.">Acts 2:1-12</a>); to a more numerous company (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-31.htm" title="And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.">Acts 4:31</a>); to Peter on the occasion of the conversion of Cornelius (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-10.htm" title="And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,">Acts 10:10-16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/10-19.htm" title="While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek you.">Acts 10:19-20</a>); to St. Paul on three occasions in the course of his second missionary journey (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-6.htm" title="Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Ghost to preach the word in Asia,">Acts 16:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/16-9.htm" title="And a vision appeared to Paul in the night; There stood a man of Macedonia, and prayed him, saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.">Acts 16:9-10</a>); through the medium of the prophet Agabus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-11.htm" title="And when he was come to us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus said the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownes this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.">Acts 21:11</a>). St. Paul alludes to many such voices of the Spirit, and heavenly intimations, when speaking to the elders of Miletus (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>).

In these Paul lived, and we are still watching the slow and solemn march past of these latter ages.

In no age, perhaps, have they been more ostentatiously thrust forward than in our own.<p><span class= "bld">Some shall depart from the faith.</span>—“By denying what is true, by adding what is false,” says Bengel.<p><span class= "bld">Giving heed to seducing spirits.</span>—This expression must not be watered down by explanations which understand this expression as referring to false teachers.

Nevertheless, knowing that in after times great corruptions, both in doctrine and practice, would at length take place in the church itself, and that the general reception of these corruptions by professed Christians would be urged as a proof of their being the truths and precepts of God, on pretence that the church is <span class="ital">the pillar, &c., of the truth, </span>the apostle, to strip these corruptions of any credit which they might derive from their being received by the multitude, and maintained by persons of the greatest note in the church, judged it necessary in this chapter to foretel the introduction of these corruptions, under the appellation of <span class="ital">an apostacy from the faith, </span>and to stigmatize the authors thereof as hypocrites and deceivers. And to give his prediction the greater authority, he informed Timothy that it was revealed to him in a peculiar and express manner. <span class="ital">The Spirit, </span>says he, <span class="ital">speaketh expressly </span>— As concerning a thing of great moment, and soon to be fulfilled. Some have thought the meaning of the apostle to be, that the Holy Spirit had revealed what follows by Daniel, and some of the other prophets; but, says Macknight, “the things here mentioned are not in Daniel, nor anywhere else in Scripture, not even in the prophecy which the apostle himself formerly delivered concerning the man of sin. I therefore think these words were, for the greater solemnity and certainty, pronounced by the Spirit in the apostle’s hearing, after he had finished the preceding passage.” But the apostle might mean, that the Holy Spirit had revealed this, not only to him, but also to other contemporary prophets.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">That in the latter, </span>or after <span class="ital">times </span>— As the phrase <span class="greekheb">εν υστεροις καιροις </span>may be translated, because it denotes future times, without marking whether they are near or remote. Or if, as Mede thinks, Daniel’s four monarchies are referred to, as it was under the Roman that the God of heaven set up the kingdom of his Son, the <span class="ital">latter, </span>or <span class="ital">after times </span>here intended, may be the last part of the duration of the Roman empire. <span class="ital">Some shall depart </span>— Or rather, <span class="ital">shall apostatize, from the faith </span>— The apostle had predicted the same thing before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, where see the notes. There the character of the teachers who were to introduce the apostacy is described; but in this epistle the erroneous opinions and corrupt practices which constituted the apostacy are foretold. And as the apostle hath introduced this prophecy immediately after his account of the mystery of godliness, is it not probable that his design in so doing was to give the faithful an opportunity of comparing this <span class="ital">mystery of iniquity </span>with the <span class="ital">mystery of godliness, </span>that they might be more sensible of the pernicious nature of it? It may be proper to observe, that it is not <span class="ital">every </span>error or heresy that is an apostacy from the faith. It is a revolt in the principal and essential articles, as when we worship God by an image or representation, or when we worship other beings besides God, and pray unto other mediators besides the one Mediator between God and men, <span class="ital">the man Christ Jesus. </span>It is the very essence of Christian worship, to worship the one true God through the one true Christ; and to worship any other God or any other Mediator, is apostacy and rebellion against God and Christ. It is, as St. Paul says, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-19.htm" title=" And not holding the Head, from which all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increases with the increase of God.">Colossians 2:19</a>,) <span class="ital">not holding the head, </span>but depending upon other heads; it is, as St. Peter expresses it, <span class="ital">denying the Lord that bought us, </span>and serving other lords; and the denial of such an essential part may as properly be called apostacy, as if we were to renounce the whole Christian faith and worship. It is renouncing them in effect, and not regarding God as God, or Christ as Christ. Such is the nature of <span class="ital">apostacy from the faith, </span>and it is implied that this apostacy should be general, and infect great numbers. For though it be said only <span class="ital">some </span>shall apostatize, yet by <span class="ital">some </span>in this place <span class="ital">many </span>are understood, which is the case also in many other passages of the Scriptures, as Bishop Newton has fully proved. <span class="ital">Giving heed to seducing spirits </span>— Who inspire false teachers; or to men that persuade others to believe them by the pretence of some inspiration or revelation of the Holy Spirit, and thereby cause people to err from the true faith of the gospel. The apostle means those gross frauds by which the corrupt teachers, in the dark ages, would enforce their erroneous doctrines and superstitious practices on the ignorant multitudes, under the notion of revelations from God, or from angels, or departed saints. In the same sense St. John is to be understood, when he says, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm" title="Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into the world.">1 John 4:1</a>,) <span class="ital">Believe not every spirit, </span>every pretender to inspiration, <span class="ital">but try the spirits whether they be of God. And </span>to <span class="ital">doctrines of devils </span>— Or rather, doctrines concerning demons. The word <span class="greekheb">διαμονια</span>, translated <span class="ital">demons, </span>was used by the Greeks to denote a kind of beings of a middle nature between God and man. They gave the same name also to the souls of some departed men, who they thought were exalted to the state and honour of demons for their virtue. The former sort they called <span class="ital">superior demons, </span>and supposed them to have the nature and office which we ascribe to angels. The latter they termed <span class="ital">inferior demons. </span>These were of the same character with the Romish saints. And both sorts were worshipped as mediators. When therefore the Spirit of God foretold, that in after times <span class="ital">many would give heed to deceiving spirits, and to doctrines concerning demons, </span>he foretold that, on the authority of feigned revelations, many in the church would receive the doctrine concerning the worship of angels and saints, and the praying souls out of purgatory; and called it <span class="ital">the doctrine of demons, </span>because it was in reality the same with the ancient heathenish worship of <span class="ital">demons, </span>as mediators between the gods and men. Thus the sin for which many are represented as being punished, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm" title="And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass, and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor walk:">Revelation 9:20</a>,) is said to be their worshipping, <span class="greekheb">τα δαιμονια</span>, <span class="ital">demons, </span>that is, angels and saints; not <span class="ital">devils, </span>as our translators have rendered the word, for in no period of the church have devils been worshipped by Christians.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/4.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>4:1-5 The Holy Spirit, both in the Old and the New Testament, spoke of a general turning from the faith of Christ, and the pure worship of God. This should come during the Christian dispensation, for those are called the latter days. False teachers forbid as evil what God has allowed, and command as a duty what he has left indifferent. We find exercise for watchfulness and self-denial, in attending to the requirements of God's law, without being tasked to imaginary duties, which reject what he has allowed. But nothing justifies an intemperate or improper use of things; and nothing will be good to us, unless we seek by prayer for the Lord's blessing upon it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/4.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Now the Spirit - Evidently the Holy Spirit; the Spirit of inspiration. It is not quite certain, from this passage, whether the apostle means to say that this was a revelation "then" made to him, or whether it was a well-understood thing as taught by the Holy Spirit. He himself elsewhere refers to this same prophecy, and John also more than once mentions it; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2.htm">2 Thessalonians 2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/20-1.htm">Revelation 20:1-15</a>. From <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-5.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:5</a>, it would seem that this was a truth which had before been communicated to the apostle Paul, and that he had dwelt on it when he preached the gospel in Thessalonica. There is no improbability, however, in the supposition that so important a subject was communicated directly by the Holy Spirit to others of the apostles.<p>Speaketh expressly - In express words, &#x3c1;&#788;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;  re&#772;to&#772;s. It was not by mere hints, and symbols, and shadowy images of the future; it was in an open and plain manner - in so many words. The object of this statement seems to be to call the attention of Timothy to it in an emphatic manner, and to show the importance of attending to it.<p>That in the latter times - Under the last dispensation, during which the affairs of the world would close; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-2.htm">Hebrews 1:2</a>. It does not mean that this would occur "just before" the end of the world, but that it would take place during "that last dispensation," and that the end of the world would not happen until this should take place; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>.<p>Some shall depart from the faith - The Greek word here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  aposte&#772;sontai - is that from which we have derived the word "apostatize," and would be properly so rendered here. The meaning is, that they would "apostatize" from the belief of the truths of the gospel. It does not mean that, as individuals, they would have been true Christians; but that there would be a departure from the great doctrines which constitute the Christian faith. The ways in which they would do this are immediately specified, showing what the apostle meant here by departing from the faith. They would give heed to seducing spirits, to the doctrines of devils, etc. The use of the word "some," here &#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;  tines - does not imply that the number would be small. The meaning is, that "certain persons" would thus depart, or that "there would be" an apostasy of the kind here mentioned, in the last days. From the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>, it would seem that this was to be an extensive apostasy.<p>Giving heed to seducing spirits - Rather than to the Spirit of God. It would be a part of their system to yield to those spirits that led astray. The spirits here referred to are any that cause to err, and the most obvious and natural construction is to refer it to the agency of fallen spirits. Though it "may" apply to false teachers, yet, if so, it is rather to them as under the influence of evil spirits. This may be applied, so far as the phraseology is concerned, to "any" false teaching; but it is evident that the apostle had a specific apostasy in view - some great "system" that would greatly corrupt the Christian faith; and the words here should be interpreted with reference to that. It is true that people in all ages are prone to give heed to seducing spirits; but the thing referred to here is some grand apostasy, in which the characteristics would be manifested, and the doctrines held, which the apostle proceeds immediately to specify; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-1.htm">1 John 4:1</a>.<p>And doctrines of devils - Greek, "Teachings of demons -  &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#x3bd;  didaskaliais daimo&#772;nio&#772;n. This may either mean teachings "respecting" demons, or teachings "by" demons. The particular sense must be determined by the connection. Ambiguity of this kind in the construction of words, where one is in the genitive case, is not uncommon; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/15-9.htm">John 15:9-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/21-15.htm">John 21:15</a>. Instances of the construction where the genitive denotes the "object," and should be translated "concerning," occur in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-25.htm">Matthew 9:25</a>; "The gospel of the kingdom," i. e., concerning the kingdom; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-1.htm">Matthew 10:1</a>; "Power of unclean spirits," i. e., over or concerning unclean spirits; so, also, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/4-9.htm">Acts 4:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-15.htm">Romans 16:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-5.htm">2 Corinthians 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-1.htm">Ephesians 3:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-13.htm">Revelation 2:13</a>. Instances of construction where the genitive denotes the "agent," occur in the following places: <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/1-69.htm">Luke 1:69</a>, "A horn of salvation," i. e., a horn which produces or causes salvation; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-28.htm">John 6:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-10.htm">2 Corinthians 4:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-18.htm">Ephesians 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-11.htm">Colossians 2:11</a>. Whether the phrase here means that, in the apostasy, they would give heed to doctrines "respecting" demons, or to doctrines which demons "taught," cannot, it seems to me, be determined with certainty. If the previous phrase, however, means that they would embrace doctrines taught by evil spirits, it can hardly be supposed that the apostle would immediately repeat the same idea in another form; and then the sense would be, that one characteristic of the time referred to would be the prevalent teaching "respecting" demons. They would "give heed to," or embrace, some special views respecting demons. The word here rendered "devils" is &#x3b4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  daimonia - "demons." This word, among the Greeks, denoted the following things:<p>(1) A god or goddess, spoken of the pagan gods; compare in New Testament, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/17-18.htm">Acts 17:18</a>.<p>(2) a divine being, where no particular one was specified, the agent or author of good or evil fortune; of death, fate, etc. In this sense it is often used in Homer.<p>(3) the souls of people of the golden age, which dwelt unobserved upon the earth to regard the actions of men, and to defend them - tutelary divinities, or geniuses - like that which Socrates regarded as his constant attendant. Xen. Mem. 4. 8. 1. 5; Apol. Soc. 4. See "Passow."<p>(4) to this may be added the common use in the New Testament, where the word denotes a demon in the Jewish sense - a bad spirit, subject to Satan, and under his control; one of the host of fallen angels - commonly, but not very properly rendered "devil" or "devils." These spirits were supposed to wander in desolate places, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-43.htm">Matthew 12:43</a>; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-21.htm">Isaiah 13:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/34-14.htm">Isaiah 34:14</a>; or they dwell in the air, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-2.htm">Ephesians 2:2</a>. They were regarded as hostile to mankind, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/8-44.htm">John 8:44</a>; as able to utter pagan oracles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-17.htm">Acts 16:17</a>; as lurking in the idols of the pagan, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/10-20.htm">1 Corinthians 10:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/9-20.htm">Revelation 9:20</a>. They are spoken of as the authors of evil, <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-19.htm">James 2:19</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm">Ephesians 6:12</a>, and as having the power of taking "possession" of a person, of producing diseases, or of causing mania, as in the case of the demoniacs, <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/4-33.htm">Luke 4:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-27.htm">Luke 8:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-18.htm">Matthew 17:18</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/mark/7-29.htm">Mark 7:29-30</a>; and often elsewhere. The doctrine, therefore, which the apostle predicted would prevail, might, "so far as the word used is concerned," be either of the following:<p>(1) Accordance with the prevalent notions of the pagan respecting false gods; or a falling into idolatry similar to that taught in the Grecian mythology. It can hardly be supposed, however, that he designed to say that the common notions of the pagan would prevail in the Christian church, or that the worship of the pagan gods "as such" would be set up there.<p>(2) an accordance with the Jewish views respecting demoniacal possessions and the power of exorcising them. If this view should extensively prevail in the Christian church, it would be in accordance with the language of the prediction.<p>(3) accordance with the prevalent pagan notions respecting the departed spirits of the good and the great, who were exalted to the rank of demi-gods, and who, though invisible, were supposed still to exert an important influence in favor of mankind. To these beings, the pagan rendered extraordinary homage. They regarded them as demi-gods. They supposed that they took a deep interest in human affairs. They invoked their aid. They set apart days in honor of them. They offered sacrifices, and performed rites and ceremonies to propitiate their favor. They were regarded as a sort of mediators or intercessors between man and the superior divinities. If these things are found anywhere in the Christian church, they may be regarded as a fulfillment of this prediction, for they were not of a nature to be foreseen by any human sagacity. Now it so happens, that they are in fact found in the Papal communion, and in a way that corresponds fairly to the meaning of the phrase, as it would have been understood in the time of the apostle.<p>There is, "first," the worship of the virgin and of the saints, or the extraordinary honors rendered to them - corresponding almost entirely with the reverence paid by the pagan to the spirits of heroes or to demi-gods. The saints are supposed to have extraordinary power with God, and their aid is implored as intercessors. The virgin Mary is invoked as "the mother of God," and as having power still to command her Son. The Papists do not, indeed, offer the same homage to the saints which they do to God, but they ask their aid; they offer prayer to them. The following extracts from the catechism of Dr. James Butler, approved and recommended by Dr. Kenrick, "Bishop of Philadelphia," expresses the general views of Roman Catholics on this subject. "Question: How do Catholics distinguish between the honor they give to God, and the honor they give to the saints, when they pray to God and the saints?<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/4.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 4<p>1Ti 4:1-16.

This the apostle saith should be in the <span class="ital">latter times.</span> The last times (saith the afore-mentioned famous author) are the times of Christ’s kingdom, which began in the time of the Roman empire; during which time this Epistle was written, where the apostle speaking of time yet to come, the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">latter times</span> by him mentioned must needs be the latter part of the last times, which he saith began in the ruin of the Roman empire, upon which followed the revealing of antichrist, that wicked one, mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-7.htm" title="For the mystery of iniquity does already work: only he who now lets will let, until he be taken out of the way.">2 Thessalonians 2:7</a></span>.

But others think that by <span class="ital">doctrines of devils</span> here are not to be understood doctrines so published, but doctrines concerning devils; and that the meaning is, that in the last times the pagan doctrine concerning demons should be restored. The pagan demons were an inferior sort of gods, a kind of middle beings between their highest gods and men, whose office was to be advocates and mediators between men and the highest gods, because they judged it was not lawful for men to come to the highest gods immediately; these they worshipped by images, even as the papists at this day make use of and worship angels and saints. See more fully what Mr. Mede saith upon this argument in his own book, and in Mr. Pool’s Latin Synopsis upon this text; and what he saith seems very probably the sense of this text, especially considering the two doctrines mentioned <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-3.htm" title="Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats, which God has created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth.">1 Timothy 4:3</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/4.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Now the Spirit speaketh expressly,.... The prophecy hereafter mentioned was not an human conjecture, but, as all true prophecy, it came from the Spirit of God, who spoke or delivered it; either in the prophets of the Old Testament, who, as they spoke of the Gospel dispensation, so of the defection that should be in it; and particularly of antichrist, and of the apostasy through him, which is what is here intended, especially in Daniel's prophecies, under the names of the little horn, and vile person, <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/7-1.htm">Daniel 7:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/11-1.htm">Daniel 11:1</a>, or in the Lord Jesus Christ, who foretold that false prophets would arise and deceive many; or in some of the prophets in the Christian church, such as Agabus, and others, who might in so many words foretell this thing; or rather in the apostle himself, at this time, since this prophecy was delivered not in dark sayings, in an enigmatical way, in an obscure manner, as prophecies generally were, but in plain language, and easy to be understood, and wanted no interpreter to unriddle it; and seeing that it is nowhere to be found in so many express words elsewhere: and moreover, the apostle does not say the Spirit "hath spoken", but the Spirit "speaketh"; then, at the time of the writing of these words, in and by him. The prediction follows, <p>that in the latter times some should depart from the faith; that is, from the doctrine of faith, notwithstanding it is indisputably the great mystery of godliness, as it is called in the latter part of the preceding chapter; for from the true grace of faith there can be no final and total apostasy, such as is here designed; for that can never be lost. It is of an incorruptible nature, and therefore more precious than gold that perishes; Christ is the author and finisher of it; his prevalent mediation is concerned for it; it is a gift of special grace, and is without repentance; it springs from electing grace, and is secured by it; and between that and salvation there is an inseparable connection; it may indeed decline, be very low, and lie dormant, as to its acts and exercise, but not be lost: there is a temporary faith, and a persuasion of truth, or a mere assent to it, which may be departed from, but not that faith which works by love: here it intends a profession of faith, which being made, should be dropped by some; or rather the doctrine of faith, which some would embrace, and then err concerning, or entirely quit, and wholly apostatize from. And they are said to be some, and these many, as they are elsewhere represented, though not all; for the elect cannot be finally and totally deceived; the foundation of election stands sure amidst the greatest apostasy; and there are always a few names that are not defiled with corrupt principles and practices; Christ always had some witnesses for the truth in the darkest times: and now this defection was to be "in the latter times"; either of the apostolic age, which John, the last of the apostles, lived to see; and therefore he calls it the last time, or hour, in which were many antichrists, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm">1 John 2:18</a>. And indeed in the Apostle Paul's time the mystery of iniquity began to work, which brought on this general defection; though here it has regard to some later times under the Gospel dispensation; to the time when the man of sin, and the son of perdition, was revealed, and when all the world wondered after the beast: and indeed, such will be the degeneracy in the last days of all, that when the son of man comes, as the grace, so the doctrine of faith will be scarcely to be found in the world: the means by which this apostasy will obtain and prevail will be through men's <p>giving heed to seducing spirits; either to doctrines which are of a deceiving nature; or to men who profess to have the Spirit of God, and have not, but are evil men and seducers, deceiving, and being deceived; that lie in wait to deceive, and handle the word of God deceitfully; and by attending on the ministry of such persons, through hearing them, and conversing with them, the defection was to begin and spread; and therefore such should be carefully avoided, and their ministry shunned; nor should they be received, nor bid God speed. <p>And doctrines of devils; such as are devised by devils, as all damnable doctrines be; and all lying ones, for the devil is the father of them; and as are all the false doctrines introduced by antichrist, for his coming was after the working of Satan; and particularly those doctrines of his concerning worshipping of angels, and saints departed, may be called the doctrines of devils, or of "demons"; being much the same with the demon worship among the Heathens, of which the devil was the inventor: unless by doctrines of devils should be meant the doctrines of men, who for their cunning and sophistry, for their lies and hypocrisy, for their malice, and murdering of the souls of men, are comparable to devils. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/4.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Now <span class="cverse3">{1}</span> the Spirit speaketh expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;</span><p>(1) He contrasts that true doctrine, with false opinions, which he foretells that certain ones who shall fall away from God and his religion, will bring in by the suggestion of Satan, and so that a great number will give ear to them.<p>(a) From the true doctrine of God.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/4.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>.

To explain the expression by <span class="greekheb">οἱ πνευματικοί</span> (Heydenreich) is inaccurate. Paul goes back here to the fundamental basis of all prophecy.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ῥητῶς</span> (<span class="greekheb">ἅπαξ λεγ</span>.) means: “<span class="ital">in express words</span>,” and is used particularly with quotations.[151] Heydenreich is inaccurate in explaining it as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">σαφῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">φανερῶς</span>; Luther: “distinctly.” The apostle, then, appeals here to a prophecy of the Spirit expressly worded. Such a prophecy of the future apostasy lay before him in many utterances, both of Christ and of others; besides, the Spirit declared them to the apostle himself.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Leo is wrong: animus mihi praesagit.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐν ὑστέροις καιροῖς ἀποστήσονταί τινες τῆς πίστεως</span>] We might readily take <span class="greekheb">ὕστεροι καιροί</span> here as equivalent to <span class="greekheb">ἔσχατοι καιροί</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-1.htm" title="This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come.">2 Timothy 3:1</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἔσχαται ἡμέραι</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-5.htm" title="Who are kept by the power of God through faith to salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.">1 Peter 1:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">καιρὸς ἔσχατος</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-3.htm" title="Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days scoffers, walking after their own lusts,">2 Peter 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-18.htm" title="And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not.

The former points simply to the future, the latter to the last time of the future, immediately preceding the completion of God’s kingdom and the second coming of Christ (so, too, van Oosterzee, Hofmann). It is unsuitable to press <span class="greekheb">καιρός</span> here in the sense of “the fitting time,” and to translate it with Matthies: “in the fitting time hereafter.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Τινες</span> are not the heretics, but those who are led away from the faith by the heretics. The apostasy belonged to the future, but the heresy to the present. Hofmann thinks differently, assigning the heresy also to the future, though the apostle’s expression does not warrant this.[152] We must not, however, with Otto, infer that in the apostle’s time the heretics were still outside the church.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἀποστήσονται τῆς πίστεως</span>] “This sentence forms the antithesis to what has preceded, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth....">1 Timothy 3:15-16</a>” (Wiesinger); for the expression, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/8-13.htm" title="They on the rock are they, which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.">Luke 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/3-12.htm" title="Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living God.">Hebrews 3:12</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/wisdom_of_solomon/3-10.htm" title="But the ungodly shall be punished according to their own imaginations, which have neglected the righteous, and forsaken the Lord.">Wis 3:10</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/1_maccabees/1-15.htm" title="And made themselves uncircumcised, and forsook the holy covenant, and joined themselves to the heathen, and were sold to do mischief.">1Ma 1:15</a>, and other passages.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">προσέχοντες</span>] comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm" title="Neither give heed to fables and endless genealogies, which minister questions, rather than godly edifying which is in faith: so do.">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; the partic. tells how the apostasy is brought about.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">πνεύμασι πλάνοις</span>] the <span class="greekheb">πνεύματα πλάνα</span> are in contrast with the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; and the former are as little to be identified with the heretics, as the latter with the prophets (Wolf: spirituales seductores, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> doctores seducentes).

The teachers and ministers of the Church must hold her central doctrine. It stands strong and firm—a rock pillar; ‘Christ the Son of the living God,’ (1) incarnate, (2) redeemer of the world. But there will be, notwithstanding, false teachers, evil heresies, subverting this great mystery of Godliness. See Bp Wordsworth’s note. ‘For example, <span class="ital">forbidding to marry</span> is heresy, since by His incarnation the Son of God has married our Nature, has espoused to Himself a Church and so has sanctified marriage. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ephesians/5-23.htm" title="For the husband is the head of the wife, even as Christ is the head of the church: and he is the savior of the body....">Ephesians 5:23-32</a>. <span class="ital">Commanding to abstain from meats</span> is heresy, since if (as is implied in the command) the flesh was created by the <span class="ital">evil principle</span>, and was therefore unclean, God could not have taken human flesh and united it for ever to the Godhead: and it is heresy too, since Christ, the second Adam, recovered for us the free use of all the creatures of God and recovered for them their original benediction.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘The Spirit,’ as very frequently, put alone for ‘the Holy Spirit’; <span class="ital">where</span> ‘the Spirit saith expressly’ and distinctly that these heresies will arise, is not clear. The words of our Lord (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/26-11.htm" title="For you have the poor always with you; but me you have not always.">Matthew 26:11</a>), of the prophets in various Christian Churches, of St Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-3.htm" title="Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;">2 Thessalonians 2:3</a>) are referred to. But it may be best to take the passage here as itself the new and more explicit utterance by the Spirit in St Paul of what is coming; in a manner similar to St Paul’s statement at Miletus of what would befall himself and the Church at Ephesus, ‘the Holy Ghost testifieth unto me in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me … I know that … from among your ownselves shall men arise speaking perverse things.’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-23.htm" title="Save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.">Acts 20:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-29.htm" title="For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.">Acts 20:29</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">expressly</span>] The Greek word is postclassical and occurs here only in N.T.

So Huther, ‘The former points simply to the future, the latter to the last time of the future.’ But the distinction must not be too much pressed: the ‘later times’ predicted here are surely the ‘last hour’ spoken of by St John (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>) some 25 years later, if, as Bp Westcott says of the date of that letter, ‘this may be fixed with reasonable likelihood in the last decade of the first century.’ He adds on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/2-18.htm" title="Little children, it is the last time: and as you have heard that antichrist shall come, even now are there many antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.">1 John 2:18</a>, ‘the last days are found in each of the seasons of fierce trial which precede the several comings of Christ. The phrase marks a period of critical change.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">shall depart from the faith</span>] R.V. <span class="bld">fall away</span>, as the parent of a word afterwards used still more definitely, ‘apostate.’ ‘The faith’ objectively as above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">seducing spirits</span>] Here opposed to ‘the Spirit,’ as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-6.htm" title="We are of God: he that knows God hears us; he that is not of God hears not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and the spirit of error.">1 John 4:6</a>, giving the history of what is here prophecy, we have the cognate substantive: the adjective ‘deceiving’ or ‘deceiver’ occurs <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-63.htm" title="Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.">Matthew 27:63</a>, ‘that deceiver said,’ and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-8.htm" title="We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed, but not in despair;">2 Corinthians 4:8</a>, but is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm" title="For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and an antichrist.">2 John 1:7</a>, evidently with reference to the same heresy as here. The substantive has been rendered by A.V. sometimes ‘deceit,’ sometimes ‘error;’ by R.V. always ‘error.’ These deceiving spirits, as Bp Ellicott says, are the spiritual emissaries of Satan which work in their hearts; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-12.htm" title="For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places.">Ephesians 6:12</a>. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-3.htm" title="And every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of antichrist, whereof you have heard that it should come; and even now already is it in the world.">1 John 4:3</a>, where the proof of a spirit being ‘not of God’ is the failure to confess the Incarnation. ‘The many false spirits represent one personal power of falsehood, the prince of the world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/12-31.htm" title="Now is the judgment of this world: now shall the prince of this world be cast out.">John 12:31</a>), the devil, whose “children” the wicked are (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-10.htm" title="In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whoever does not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loves not his brother.">1 John 3:10</a>). The many false prophets stand in a relation towards the Spirit like that which the “many Antichrists” occupy towards Christ. <span class="ital">Through them evil spiritual powers find expression</span>.’ Westcott.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">doctrines of devils</span>] The last sentence seems an exact paraphrase of this clause, the instructions given by the evil spirits to the false teachers used by them as ‘their organs through whom to speak.’ ‘Devils’ or ‘demons’ is clearly thus a subjective genitive. The word ‘demon’ in general classical usage signified intermediate beings, the messengers of the Gods to men. The notion of <span class="ital">evil</span> demons was due to the later influences of the East, and in LXX. the word is generally used of the heathen idols, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-3.htm" title="For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.">Psalm 95:3</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/10-19.htm" title="What say I then? that the idol is any thing, or that which is offered in sacrifice to idols is any thing?...">1 Corinthians 10:19-20</a>; but Josephus employs it always of evil spirits, <span class="ital">Bell.
