A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Not given to wine - Margin, "Not ready to quarrel and offer wrong, as one in wine." The Greek word (&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  paroinos) occurs in the New Testament only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>. It means, properly, "by wine;" i. e., spoken of what takes place "by" or "over" wine, as revelry, drinking songs, etc. Then it denotes, as it does here, one who sits "by" wine; that is, who is in the habit of drinking it. It cannot be inferred, from the use of the word here, that wine was absolutely and entirely prohibited; for the word does not properly express that idea. It means that one who is in the habit of drinking wine, or who is accustomed to sit with those who indulge in it, should not be admitted to the ministry. The way in which the apostle mentions the subject here would lead us fairly to suppose that he did not mean to commend its use in any sense; that he regarded its use as dangerous, and that he would wish the ministers of religion to avoid it altogether. In regard to its use at all, except at the communion or as a medicine, it may be remarked, that a minister will do no injury to himself or others by letting it entirely alone; he may do injury by indulging in it. No man is under any "obligation" of courtesy or Christian duty to use it; thousands of ministers of the gospel have brought ruin on themselves, and disgrace on the ministry, by its use; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-9.htm">Matthew 11:9</a> note, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a> note.<p>No striker - He must be a peaceable, not a quarrelsome man. This is connected with the caution about the use of wine, probably, because that is commonly found to produce a spirit of contention and strife.<p>Not greedy of filthy lucre - Not contentious or avaricious. Greek, Not desirous of base gain. The desire of this is condemned everywhere in the New Testament; but it is especially the duty of a minister of the gospel to be free from it. He has a right to a support (see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/9.htm">1 Corinthians 9</a>); but there is nothing that more certainly paralyzes the usefulness of a minister of the gospel than the love of money. There is an instinctive feeling in the human bosom that such a man ought to be actuated by a nobler and a purer principle. As avarice, moreover, is the great sin of the world - the sin that sways more hearts, and does more to hinder the progress of the gospel, than all others combined - it is important in the highest degree that the minister of religion should be an example of what men "should" be, and that he, by his whole life, should set his face against that which is the main obstruction to the progress of that gospel which he is appointed to preach.<p>But patient - Modest, mild, gentle. See the word (Greek) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-5.htm">Philippians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-2.htm">Titus 3:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/3-17.htm">James 3:17</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/2-18.htm">1 Peter 2:18</a>, where it is rendered "gentle." The word means that the minister of the gospel should be a man of mild and kind demeanor, such as his Master was.<p>Not a brawler - compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-24.htm">2 Timothy 2:24</a>. That is, he should not be a man given to contention, or apt to take up a quarrel. The Greek is, literally, "Not disposed to fight."<p>Not covetous - Greek, "Not a lover of silver;" that is, of money. A man should not be put into the ministry who is characteristically a lover of money. Such a one, no matter what his talents may be, has no proper qualification for the office, and will do more harm than good. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

One that does not sit at it, or is continually drinking it, and is intemperate in the use of it; otherwise it is lawful for persons in such an office to drink wine, and sometimes absolutely necessary; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-23.htm">1 Timothy 5:23</a> it signifies one that is not given to much wine, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm">1 Timothy 3:8</a> is not addicted to it, or a follower of it; the Syriac version renders it, "who does not transgress over wine", or go beyond due bounds in the use of it, who is not immoderate in it; the Arabic version renders it, "not insolent through wine", as one that is heated with it is fierce and furious, and wrangling and quarrelsome, and often very mischievous and injurious; and this sense is followed by some. <p>No striker; either with his hands, so the Syriac version, "whose hand is not swift to strike"; not one who is nimble and ready at it, who no sooner is abused or injured, but he lifts up his hands and strikes; is but a word and a blow: or with his tongue; so the Arabic version, "not wounding with his tongue"; being too sharp and severe in the admonitions and reproofs of weak brethren, or fallen believers; and especially, he ought not to use scurrilous, reproachful, and contumelious language to any; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-18.htm">Jeremiah 18:18</a>. <p>Not greedy of filthy lucre; not covetous of getting money, of amassing wealth and riches together; or desirous of popular applause and glory from men. This clause is not in the Alexandrian copy, nor in five of Beza's manuscripts and other copies, nor is it in the Vulgate Latin version, nor in any of the Oriental versions; it seems to be transcribed from <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-7.htm">Titus 1:7</a>. And indeed it is unnecessary here; since the same is expressed by the word "covetous", at the end of the verse, and makes that a tautology; and moreover, by leaving out this clause, the opposition appears more manifest, between "no striker" and what follows, <p>but patient; one who patiently bears all reproaches and injuries, puts up with affronts, and gives up what is his right and due, rather than contend, quarrel, and strike; who is patient towards all men, and does not bear hard on those that have offended, but is moderate and mild, and gentle in his censures, reproofs, and admonitions: <p>not a brawler; not a quarrelsome litigious person, given to fighting, either with the fist or sword, or any other weapon: <p>not covetous; or a lover of money in an immoderate way, greedy of worldly substance and riches, and insatiable in his desires after them; niggardly, sordid, and illiberal; acting a mercenary part; seeking his own things, and not the things of Christ; his gain from his quarter, and not the good of souls; and withholding from himself, from his family, and the poor, what ought to be enjoyed by them. Whereas, on the other hand, he ought to be generous and liberal, hospitable and charitable, and ready to communicate on all occasions, according to his abilities. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Not <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;</span><p>(c) A common drinker and one that will often partake of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Not given to wine, no striker, not greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not covetous;">1 Timothy 3:3</a>.

It is true that, as Bengel indicates, the <span class="greekheb">ἀλλʼ ἐπιεικῆ</span> afterwards seems to be in favour of the wider meaning here, without special reference to drunkenness; but the contrast is the same in the other case, if we only remember that <span class="greekheb">πάροινος</span> does not mean simply “drunken,” but “impudent, arrogant in intoxication.”[119]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ πλήκτην</span>] This word also may be taken in a narrower and a wider sense.

The verb &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to behave ill at wine, to treat with drunken violence, is found in Xenophon, Aeschines, Aristophanes, and Aristotle. Once in lxx, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-12.htm">Isaiah 41:12</a>. Rev. renders brawler, which is not definite enough. Better, quarrelsome over wine. See Aristoph.

Some soften down the meaning into a pugnacious or combative person. In any case, it is a peculiar state of things which calls out such admonitions to Bishops.<p>Not greedy of filthy lucre<p>Omit.<p>Patient (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#834;)<p>Better, forbearing.

From &#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; reasonable. Hence, not unduly rigorous; not making a determined stand for one's just due.

For the distinction see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-29.htm">Romans 1:29</a>.<p>This admonition is cited by some writers in support of the view that the original &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; was simply a financial officer. It is assumed that it was prompted by the special temptations which attached to the financial function. Admitting that the episcopal function may have included the financial interests of the church, it could not have been confined to these. It can hardly be supposed that, in associations distinctively moral and religious, one who bore the title of overseer should have been concerned only with the material side of church life. </body></html>
