He speaks of it as “a treasure” which must be held in the casket of a pure conscience. This mystery was what was sometimes hidden, but which was now revealed by the advent of St. Paul’s Master, and comprehended the truths of the redemption, the atonement, and mighty cleansing powers of the precious blood of Christ. These—the master truths of Christianity—must the appointed teacher firmly grasp; and the true deacon, whose office it was rather <span class= "ital">to administer</span> than <span class= "ital">to preach</span> to the people, must also be especially careful to show that he lived the life he professed to teach; or, in St. Paul’s own simile, must preserve the casket in which the precious mystery was shrined, holy and undefiled before men—<span class= "ital">he must hold the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them.

The doctrine of the Gospel, called the "faith", because it contains things to be believed; proposes Christ the object of faith; is the means by which faith comes, and is unprofitable without it: it is called "the mystery", because it is of divine revelation, and could have never been discovered by human reason; and now it is revealed, the modus of many things contained in it remains a mystery; several of the doctrines of it are mysterious ones, particularly the doctrine of the Trinity; and which the ancient Jews call by this very name, (a) , "the mystery of faith"; the incarnation of the Son of God, the union of the saints to Christ, and their communion with him, and the resurrection of the dead, with others. Now this mysterious doctrine of faith is to be held by deacons; they are to profess it, and to hold fast the profession of it and that <p>in a pure conscience; with a conscience sprinkled by the blood of Christ; with a conscience void of offence both towards God and man; with a suitable life and conversation; a conversation becoming the Gospel of Christ, and by which it is adorned: and this part of their character is necessary, that such may be able to instruct and establish those who are weak in the faith, and oppose and refute the erroneous, and also recommend the Gospel by their own example; otherwise should their principles or practices be bad, their influence on others might be very pernicious and fatal. <p>(a) Zohar in Gen. fol. 12. 4. &amp; 13. 1, 2. &amp; in Exod. fol. 66. 3.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ἔχοντας τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει</span>] The emphasis is not on <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντας</span>, as if it meant “holding fast,” but on <span class="greekheb">ἐν καθαρᾷ συνειδήσει</span> (Wiesinger).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον τῆς πίστεως</span>] This collocation occurs nowhere else. <span class="greekheb">Πίστις</span> is not the doctrine of faith (Heumann), but subjective faith (de Wette). <span class="greekheb">Μυστήριον</span> is the subject-matter of faith, <span class="ital">i.e.</span> the divine truth, which is a secret not only in so far as it was hidden from the world until it was revealed at the appointed time (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-25.htm" title="Now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,">Romans 16:25</a>) and remains hidden to every man till the knowledge of it is wrought in him by the Spirit of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/2-7.htm" title="But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:...">1 Corinthians 2:7-10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-14.htm" title="But the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.">1 Corinthians 2:14</a>), but also in so far as it is even to the believer <span class="greekheb">ὑπερβαλλοῦσα τῆς γνώσεως</span> (Wiesinger).

Coming from the Greek, ‘to close the mouth,’ and so ‘to initiate,’ it was originally used of the secret rites of Eleusis in Attica, into which each year the youth of Athens were initiated at the annual celebrations. Thence by the process so loved by St Paul of consecrating old words to higher use it becomes the pregnant expression of the truth, ‘latet in vetere novum testamentum, vetus in novo patet.’ It is a truth once hidden but now revealed, a truth which may be apprehended though not comprehended.

"The faith" is equivalent to "the gospel," or "the kingdom of heaven," or the "godliness" of ver. 16 (where see note); and "the mystery of the faith" might be paraphrased by "the revealed truth of Christianity". What is added, "in a pure conscience," teaches us that orthodoxy without personal holiness is little worth. Holding "the truth in unrighteousness" is severely condemned by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-18.htm">Romans 1:18</a>). He says of himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/23-1.htm">Acts 23:1</a>), "I have lived in all good conscience before God until this day" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-16.htm">Acts 24:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/1-12.htm">2 Corinthians 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5, 19</a>, etc.).

Const. with holding. The emphasis of the passage is on these words. They express conscientious purity and sincerity in contrast with those who are described as branded in their own conscience, and thus causing their followers to fall away from the faith (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-2.htm">1 Timothy 4:2</a>). The passage illustrates the peculiar treatment of "faith" in these Epistles, in emphasizing its ethical aspect and its ethical environment. This is not contrary to Paul's teaching, nor does it go to the extent of substituting morals for faith as the condition of salvation and eternal life. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-9.htm">2 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-1.htm">2 Timothy 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-5.htm">Titus 3:5</a>. Nonetheless, there is a strong and habitual emphasis on good works (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm">1 Timothy 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-10.htm">1 Timothy 5:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm">1 Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-21.htm">2 Timothy 2:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm">Titus 1:16</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm">Titus 2:7</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-14.htm">Titus 2:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-1.htm">Titus 3:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/3-8.htm">Titus 3:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-14.htm">Titus 3:14</a>), and faith is placed in a series of practical duties (see <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm">1 Timothy 1:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-14.htm">1 Timothy 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-15.htm">1 Timothy 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-12.htm">1 Timothy 4:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-13.htm">2 Timothy 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-10.htm">2 Timothy 3:10</a>). "Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience" is a significant association of faith with ethics. As Weiss puts it: "It is as if the pure conscience were the vessel in which the mystery of the faith is preserved." The idea is sound and valuable. A merely intellectual attitude toward the mystery which, in every age, attaches to the faith, will result in doubt, questioning, and wordy strife (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-23.htm">2 Timothy 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-9.htm">Titus 3:9</a>), sometimes in moral laxity, sometimes in despair. Loyalty and duty to God are compatible with more or less ignorance concerning the mystery. An intellect, however powerful and active, joined with an impure conscience, cannot solve but only aggravates the mystery; whereas a pure and loyal conscience, and a frank acceptance of imposed duty along with mystery, puts one in the best attitude for attaining whatever solution is possible.
