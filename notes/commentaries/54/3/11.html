The question naturally occurs—why are <span class= "ital">deacon’s</span> wives especially referred to, while nothing has been said respecting the wives of presbyters? Then, again, why should the choice of Timothy in the matter of his selection of a deacon be hampered with any special requirements in the wife of the candidate for the holy office? The literal translation of the Greek words would be, <span class= "ital">Women in like manner must, </span>&c. These <span class= "ital">women, </span>St. Chrysostom and most of the ancient expositors affirm, were <span class= "ital">deaconesses.</span><p>It is certain that there were women holding a kind of official position as deaconesses in the early Church; nor is it probable that these deaconesses were, as a class, confined to the restriction of age referred to in the direction respecting a band of widows devoted to works of mercy (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/5-9.htm" title="Let not a widow be taken into the number under three score years old, having been the wife of one man.">1Timothy 5:9-10</a>). These widows seemed to have been in the first instance a class or order apart from the ordinary deaconesses.<p>Phebe of Cenchrea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>), Euodias, and Syntyche (<a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/4-2.htm" title="I beseech Euodias, and beseech Syntyche, that they be of the same mind in the Lord.">Philippians 4:2</a>), probably the organisation alluded to (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/acts/9-36.htm" title="Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and giving of alms which she did.">Acts 9:36-41</a>) as existing at Joppa, of which Dorcas was the chief, may be cited as instances from the New Testament of the employment of these women-servants of the Church. In the next century the Proconsul Pliny, in his famous letter to the Emperor Trajan, distinctly alludes to these Christian deaconesses, in the words, “<span class= "ital">ancillæ quæ ministræ dicebantur.</span>” “In the Western Church,” says Professor Reynolds, “the order did not cease to exist until the fifth century, and was continued in the Greek Church till the twelfth. The deaconess vanished into the cloister until partially revived in comparatively modern times.”<p><span class= "bld">Be grave.</span>—The same word is used as in the case of the deacons. These deaconesses, too, must, with their modest behaviour, with their sweet, decorous gravity, as it has been well said, “inspire reverence having the halo of purity and sanctity about them.”<p><span class= "bld">Not slanderers.</span>—A woman’s most ready weapon is ever her tongue. She is, with all her noble, generous qualities, often quick-tempered, passionate, impulsive, jealous, and this weapon, always ready for attack or defence, is too often unsheathed.

The apostle, however, may be understood here, as not only speaking of the wives of the deacons and bishops, but of the believing women in general, and particularly of those who were invested with any office in the church. So the Vulgate interprets his meaning, having here, <span class="ital">mulieres similiter pudicas, the women in like manner must be modest. </span>Chrysostom also, and the Greek commentators, with most of the Latin fathers, were of opinion that the apostle, in this passage, is speaking both of those women who, in the first age, were employed in ministering to the afflicted, and of those who were appointed to teach the young of their own sex the principles of religion. As the manners of the Greeks did not permit men to have much intercourse with women of character, unless they were their relations, and as the Asiatics were under still greater restraints, it was proper that an order of female teachers should be instituted in the church for instructing the young of their own sex. These, it seems, were generally widows, Clement of Alexandria reckoning widows among ecclesiastical persons, <span class="ital">Pædag., </span>lib. 3. c. 12; and Grotius tells us that these female presbyters, or elders, were ordained by imposition of hands till the council of Laodicea.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Even so must their wives be grave - Chrysostom, Theophylact, Grotius, Bloomfield, and many others, suppose that by the word "wives," here, (&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#834;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;  gunaikas), the apostle means "deaconesses." Clarke supposes that it refers to women in general. The reason assigned for supposing that it does not refer to the wives of deacons, as such, is, that nothing is said of the qualifications of the wives of bishops - a matter of as much importance as that of the character of the wife of a deacon; and that it cannot be supposed that the apostle would specify the one without some allusion to the other. But that the common interpretation, which makes it refer to the wives of deacons, as such, is to be adhered to, seems to me to be clear. Because:<p>(1) it is the obvious and natural interpretation.<p>(2) the word here used - "wives" - is never used of itself to denote deaconesses.<p>(3) if the apostle had meant deaconesses, it would have been easy to express it without ambiguity; compare notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>.<p>(4) what is here mentioned is important, whether the same thing is mentioned of bishops or not.<p>(5) in the qualifications of bishops, the apostle had made a statement respecting his family, which made any specification about the particular members of the family unnecessary. He was to be one who presided in a proper manner over his own house, or who had a well-regulated family; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>. By a comparison of this passage, also, with <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3-4</a>, which bears a strong resemblance to this, it would seem that it was supposed that the deacons would be taken from those who were advanced in life, and that their wives would have some superintendence over the younger females of the church. It was, therefore, especially important that they should be persons whose influence would be known to be decidedly favorable to piety. No one can doubt that the character of a woman may be such, that it is not desirable that her husband should be an officer in the church. A bad woman ought not to be entrusted with any additional power or influence.<p>Grave - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4</a>.<p>Not slanderers - compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>, "Not false accusers." The Greek word is &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;  diabolous - "devils." It is used here in its original and proper sense, to denote a "calumniator," "slanderer," or "accuser." It occurs in the same sense in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm">2 Timothy 3:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>. Elsewhere in the New Testament, it is uniformly rendered "devil" (compare notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-1.htm">Matthew 4:1</a>), and is given to Satan, the prince of the fallen angels <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/9-34.htm">Matthew 9:34</a>, by way of eminence, as "the accuser;" compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/1-6.htm">Job 1:6-11</a> notes, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/12-10.htm">Revelation 12:10</a> note. Here it means that they should not be women who were in the habit of calumniating others, or aspersing their character. Mingling as they would with the church, and having an opportunity to claim acquaintance with many, it would be in their power, if they chose, to do great injury to the character of others.<p>Sober - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>.<p>Faithful in all things - To their husbands, to their families, to the church, to the Saviour. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. their wives&#8212;rather, "the women," that is, the deaconesses. For there is no reason that special rules should be laid down as to the wives of the deacons, and not also as to the wives of the bishops or overseers. Moreover, if the wives of the deacons were meant, there seems no reason for the omission of "their" (not in the Greek). Also the Greek for "even so" (the same as for "likewise," 1Ti 3:8, and "in like manner," 1Ti 2:9), denotes a transition to another class of persons. Further, there were doubtless deaconesses at Ephesus, such as Phœbe was at Cenchrea (Ro 16:1, "servant," Greek, "deaconess"), yet no mention is made of them in this Epistle if not here; whereas, supposing them to be meant here, the third chapter embraces in due proportion all the persons in the service of the Church. Naturally after specifying the qualifications of the deacon, Paul passes to those of the kindred office, the deaconess. "Grave" occurs in the case of both. "Not slanderers" here, answers to "not double-tongued" in the deacons; so "not false accusers" (Tit 2:3). "Sober" here answers to "not given to much wine," in the case of the deacons (1Ti 3:8). Thus it appears he requires the same qualifications in female deacons as in deacons, only with such modifications as the difference of sex suggested. Pliny, in his celebrated letter to Trajan, calls them "female ministers."<p>faithful in all things&#8212;of life as well as faith. Trustworthy in respect to the alms committed to them and their other functions, answering to "not greedy of filthy lucre," 1Ti 3:8, in the case of the deacons.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Even so must their wives be grave</span>: <span class="ital">must their</span> is not in the Greek, but supplied by our interpreters, and, as some think, ill, judging that he speaks here not of deacons’ wives, but of deaconesses, of such women as had the deacon’s office conferred on them, such a one was Phebe, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a></span>; but it may be understood of either, both ought to be not light, airy, tattling persons, but composed, serious, grave people. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not slanderers; </span> not devils, (so it is in the Greek), that is, persons given to railing and accusing others. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Sober:</span> see the sense of that word, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Faithful in all things; </span> who have approved themselves every way honest, and such persons as may be trusted. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Even so must their wives be grave,.... Some instead of "wives" read "women", and understand them of deaconesses, such as were in the primitive churches; whose business it was to visit the poor and sick sisters of the church, and take care of things belonging to them; but it is better to interpret the words of the wives of the deacons, who must be as their husbands, "grave" in speech, gesture, and dress, of an honest report, a good behaviour, and chaste conversation; which will reflect honour and credit to their husbands: <p>not slanderers; or accusers, and so act like devils, as the word is sometimes rendered; for should they act such a part, and accuse either the poor, or any of the members of the church wrongfully, or on any trifling occasion, as persons addicted to this vice are wont to do, it would be of bad consequence: and they also should be <p>sober, temperate, not given to wine; excessive drinking is very scandalous in the female sex; and is the rather mentioned here, because women in the eastern countries were too frequently addicted to it: <p>faithful in all things; as in the marriage bed, so with whatsoever else they are intrusted with in the family, and civil concerns of their husbands; and this is the rather observed, because the wives of deacons may be sometimes intrusted with the church's stock in their husband's absence, to impart to the poor. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{4}</span> Even so <i>must their</i> wives <i>be</i> grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.</span><p>(4) Regard must also be had for the pastor's and deacon's wives.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/3.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.">1 Timothy 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γυναῖκας ὡσαύτως σεμνὰς κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.] No further hint is given as to what women he is here speaking of; only it is to be observed that these instructions regarding them are inserted amongst the rules for the diaconate, since <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.">1 Timothy 3:12</a> continues to speak of the latter. They must therefore, at all events, be regarded as women who stand in close relation to the deacons—either the wives of the deacons or the deaconesses. Mack’s supposition, that they are the wives of the deacons <span class="ital">and of the bishops</span>, is quite arbitrary. The second view is found as early as in Chrysostom (<span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας διακόνους φησί</span>), Theophylact, Oecumenius, Grotius, and others; de Wette, Wiesinger, and Hofmann also think it correct. The principal grounds for it are—(1) the word <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span>, which indicates that the apostle here passes (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>) to a new class of ecclesiastical persons (Wiesinger); and (2) the fact that the instructions given in this whole section are rather directions for election than exhortations to the persons named. On the other hand, the omisson of <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span> (de Wette, Wiesinger) and the expression <span class="greekheb">πιστὰς ἐν πᾶσιν</span>, usually understood, as de Wette wrongly thinks, of conjugal fidelity, are of no weight.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against this view, however, there are two circumstances which should be considered, viz., that the instruction regarding the deaconesses is inserted among those given to the deacons, and also that the apostle calls them quite generally <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκες</span>, instead of using the definite <span class="greekheb">αἱ διάκονοι</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm" title="I commend to you Phebe our sister, which is a servant of the church which is at Cenchrea:">Romans 16:1</a>). This makes it probable that by the <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκες</span> we should understand the deacons’ wives (so, too, Plitt). The reason of the special exhortation would then be, not, as Heydenreich says, that even the domestic life of the deacons should be considered, but that the office of the deacons, consisting in the care of the poor and the sick, was of a kind in which their wives had to lend a helping hand. Hence we can explain why the wives of the bishops are not specially mentioned.[129]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">μὴ διαβόλους</span>] <span class="greekheb">διάβολος</span>, as an adjective: “slanderous,” occurs only in the Pastoral Epistles, here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm" title="Without natural affection, truce breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,">2 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΝΗΦΑΛΊΟΥς</span></span></span>] is not equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜῊ ΟἼΝῼ ΠΌΛΛῼ ΠΡΟΣΕΧΟΎΣΑς</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; it is to be taken in the same sense as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a> (in opposition to Wiesinger, van Oosterzee).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΣΤᾺς ἘΝ ΠᾶΣΙΝ</span></span></span>] “faithful in all things;” <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠᾶΣΙΝ</span></span></span> forbids us to limit the command of fidelity to any one sphere; it is not merely faithfulness at home nor in the duties of the church that is meant.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[129] Van Oosterzee’s view is arbitrary, that <span class="ital">those</span> deacons’ wives are meant who at the same time held the office of deaconess.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.">1 Timothy 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span>: Sc. <span class="greekheb">δεῖ εἶναι</span>, not governed by <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντας</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>).

They performed for the women of the early Church the same sort of ministrations that the deacons did for the men. In confirmation of this view it should be noted that <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span> is used in introducing a second or third member of a series. See on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1 Timothy 2:9</a>. The series here is of Church officials. Again, the four qualifications which follow correspond, with appropriate variations, to the first four required in deacons, as regards demeanour, government of the tongue, use of wine, and trustworthiness. And further, this is a section dealing wholly with Church officials. These considerations exclude the view that <span class="ital">women in general</span>, as R.V. apparently, are spoken of. If <span class="ital">the wives of the deacons</span> or of the clergy were meant, as A.V., it would be natural to have it unambiguously expressed, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, by the addition of <span class="greekheb">αὐτῶν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">διαβόλους</span>: <span class="ital">slanderers</span>.

Lat. gives ‘accusatrices,’ and this shews well the identity of the word with that for the great ‘accuser,’ the devil (<span class="ital">diabolus</span>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">faithful in all</span> things] That is, in all the duties of a deaconess.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/bengel/1_timothy/3.htm">Bengel's Gnomen</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-11.htm" title="Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers, sober, faithful in all things.">1 Timothy 3:11</a>. <span class="greekheb">Γυναῖκας</span>, <span class="ital">wives</span>) This depends on <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντας</span>, <span class="ital">having</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>. <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span>, <span class="ital">in like manner</span>) This refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>.—<span class="greekheb">μὴ διαβόλους</span>, <span class="ital">not slanderers</span>) especially among <span class="ital">those that are without</span>.—<span class="greekheb">πιστὰς</span>, <span class="ital">faithful</span>) This refers to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/1_timothy/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="accented">Women in like maturer must</span> for <span class="accented">even so must their wives</span>, A.V.; <span class="accented">temperate</span> for <span class="accented">sober</span>, A.V. <span class="cmt_word">Women</span>. What is meant by these "women"? Certainly not women in general, which would be quite out of harmony with the context. The choice lies between <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the wives of the deacons, as in the A.V.; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the wives of the episcopi and deacons; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> deaconesses. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This last, on the whole, is the most probable. The male deacons had just been spoken of, and so the apostle goes on to speak of the female deacons (at <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/16-1.htm">Romans 16:1</a>). He conceives of the deacon's office as consisting of two branches  - <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the deacons, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the deaconesses; <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and gives appropriate directions for each. It must he remembered that the office of the early deacon was in a great measure secular, so that there is nothing strange in that of the deaconess being coupled with it. The retrain in ver. 12 to the male deacon is in favor of understanding "the women" of the deaconesses, as showing that the subject of the diaconate was not done with. Chrysostom (who says, "He is speaking of those who hold the rank of deaconesses") and all the ancient commentators, and De Wette, Wiesinger, Wordsworth, Alford, and Ellicott among the moderns, so understand it (see following notes). <span class="cmt_word">Grave</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;</span>; see ver. 8, note). <span class="cmt_word">Not slanderers</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;&#x3b2;&#x1f79;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>, corresponding to the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8). This use of <span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x1f71;&#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, which is the classical one, is peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-3.htm">2 Timothy 3:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm">Titus 2:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Temperate</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span>; see ver. 2, note). It corresponds here to the <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x1f74;&#x20;&#x3bf;&#x1f34;&#x3bd;&#x1ff3;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bb;&#x1ff7;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f73;&#x3c7;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span> of ver. 8. <span class="cmt_word">Faithful in all things</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1fb6;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). This seems to refer specially to their being the almoners of the Church charities, and so favors the explanation of "women" as meaning deaconesses. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> means especially "trusty" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-45.htm">Matthew 24:45</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-21.htm">Matthew 25:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-42.htm">Luke 12:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/16-10.htm">Luke 16:10</a>, etc.). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Their wives (&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;)<p>Probably correct, although some find a reference to an official class of women - deaconesses (so Ellicott, Holtzmann, Alford). But the injunction is thrown incidentally into the admonition concerning Deacons, which is resumed at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-12.htm">1 Timothy 3:12</a>; and if an official class were intended we should expect something more specific than &#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; women or wives without the article. A Deacon whose wife is wanting in the qualities required in him, is not to be chosen. She would sustain an active relation to his office, and by her ministries would increase his efficiency, and by frivolity, slander, or intemperance, would bring him and his office into disrepute. </body></html>
