He must be pre-eminent in nobility of life and aims; but the life and the aims must belong to ordinary every day life. His high standard must be no inimitable one; the example must be one that all honest men may follow and copy, if they will. So, first of all (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1Timothy 3:2</a>), the Apostle places among the qualities necessary for a governing elder in the Church, the pure home life of the husband; then, after enumerating other points to be sought for in the character of one chosen to rule in the congregation, Paul comes back to this central idea, <span class= "ital">the home life of the Church official;</span> that home life must present the spectacle of a well-ordered household. This will be at least a good test of a man’s fitness to rule the large family gathered together in the form of a congregation, if his own home is gently yet firmly ruled; the wife, a pattern Christian lady; the children growing up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.<p><span class= "bld">Having his children in subjection with all gravity.</span>—The Greek word rendered “gravity” occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1Timothy 2:2</a>, where it is translated in the authorised version, not very happily, by “honesty.” The word employed in the original Greek denotes that decorum, that propriety of demeanour, which belongs especially to the pure and chaste, and seems to urge that a peculiar reverence and an especial decorum shall be aimed at in all relations with the young. <span class= "ital">Maxima</span> <span class= "ital">debetur pueris reverentia.</span> The <span class= "ital">child life</span> in the families of these ministers of Christ’s religion must, too, be an example to countless other homes.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;...">1 Timothy 3:4-6</a></span>. <span class="ital">One that ruleth well his own house — </span>That not only rules it, but rules it well, and keeps his family in good order: that rules it so as to promote religion and virtue in all its members; rules it calmly, but firmly; never using harshness where gentleness and love will produce the desired effect; <span class="ital">having his children </span>— If he be a father; <span class="ital">in subjection, with all gravity </span>— Or <span class="ital">seriousness; </span>for levity undermines all domestic authority: and he must thus rule his house both that he may set a good example to other masters of families, and that he may thereby give proof of his ability to preside over the church of God. <span class="ital">For if a man know not how to rule his own house — </span>So as to preserve a due decorum in the family where he has such a natural authority; <span class="ital">how should he </span>be able to <span class="ital">take care of </span>— Or to govern, in a proper manner, that greater and more important society, <span class="ital">the church of God </span>— In which there will be such a diversity of characters and dispositions, and over which it will be impossible for him to maintain an equal inspection and influence? <span class="ital">Not a novice — </span><span class="greekheb">νεοφυτον</span>, literally, <span class="ital">one newly ingrafted, </span>namely, into the body of Christ, or <span class="ital">newly planted, </span>namely, in the garden of his church; that is, one newly converted.

A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One that ruleth well his own house - This implies that a minister of the gospel would be, and ought to be, a married man. It is everywhere in the New Testament supposed that he would be a man who could be an example in all the relations of life. The position which he occupies in the church has a strong resemblance to the relation which a father sustains to his household; and a qualification to govern a family well, would be an evidence of a qualification to preside properly in the church. It is probable that, in the early Christian church, ministers were not unfrequently taken from those of mature life, and who were, at the time, at the head of families; and, of course, such would be men who had had an opportunity of showing that they had this qualification for the office. Though, however, this cannot be insisted on now as a "previous" qualification for the office, yet it is still true that, if he has a family, it is a necessary qualification, and that a man in the ministry "should be" one who governs his own house well. A want of this will always be a hindrance to extensive usefulness.<p>Having his children in subjection with all gravity - This does not mean that his "children" should evince gravity, whatever may be true on that point; but it refers "to the father." He should be a grave or serious man in his family; a man free from levity of character, and from frivolity and fickleness, in his conversation with his children. It does not mean that he should be severe, stern, morose - which are traits that are often mistaken for gravity, and which are as inconsistent with the proper spirit of a father as frivolity of manner - but that he should be a serious and sober-minded man. He should maintain proper "dignity" (&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;  semnote&#772;s); he should maintain self-respect, and his deportment should be such as to inspire others with respect for him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. ruleth&#8212;Greek, "presiding over."<p>his own house&#8212;children and servants, as contrasted with "the church" (house) of God (1Ti 3:5, 15) which he may be called on to preside over.<p>having his children&#8212;rather as Greek, "having children (who are) in subjection" (Tit 1:6).<p>gravity&#8212;propriety: reverent modesty on the part of the children [Alford].

In the second verse, the apostle touched on the subject of marriage-life; here, he directs how the bishop is to conduct himself in his own house.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τοῦ ἰδίου οἴκου καλῶς προϊστάμενον</span>] Though <span class="greekheb">ἴδιος</span> is used at times in the N.

It is above all important that he should act properly in regard to the children; hence the apostle adds: <span class="greekheb">τέκνα ἔχοντα ἐν ὑποταγῇ μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος</span>] From a comparison with the corresponding passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>, it is clear that he is speaking here, not of the father’s disposition, but of that of the children (in opposition to Hofmann). The <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντα ἐν ὑποταγῇ</span> corresponds in sense with <span class="greekheb">μὴ</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἀνυπότακτα</span> in the other passage, and in construction with <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντα</span> … <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐν κατηγορίᾳ ἀσωτίας</span>. The bishop is to preside over his house in such a way that the children shall not be wanting in submissiveness. The words <span class="greekheb">μετὰ πάσης σεμνότητος</span> are to be connected with what immediately precedes, and not with <span class="greekheb">προϊστάμενον</span> (Hofmann). If it be right to refer them to the fathers (Heydenrich, Matthies, van Oosterzee), <span class="greekheb">ἔχειν</span> must be explained as equivalent either to <span class="ital">tenere</span> (Matthies: “holding the children in obedience”) or to <span class="greekheb">κατέχειν</span> (van Oosterzee). That, however, is arbitrary; besides, the parallel passage in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm" title="If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of riot or unruly.">Titus 1:6</a>, where <span class="greekheb">ἀσωτία</span> is the opposite of <span class="greekheb">σεμνότης</span>, is against it. Leo, Mack, de Wette, Wiesinger, are right therefore in referring the words to the children. The idea of <span class="greekheb">σεμνότης</span> does not forbid this reference, if only we avoid thinking of little children; comp., by way of contrast, the conduct of the children of the high priest Eli, in the O.

See reff., and Hermas, <span class="ital">Vis</span>. ii. 4; Justin Martyr, <span class="ital">Apol</span>. i. 65.

It would be absurd to suppose that a man otherwise suited to the office of an episcopus would be disqualified because of childlessness. The clause is parallel to <span class="greekheb">μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἄνδρα</span>: if the episcopus be a married man, he must not be a digamist; if he have children, they must be <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑποταγῇ</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐν ὑποταγῇ</span>—<span class="greekheb">σεμνότητος</span>: <span class="ital">with the strictest regard to propriety</span>, see note on chap. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1 Timothy 2:2</a>. Most commentators join these words closely together. The <span class="greekheb">σεμνότης</span> of the children in their extra-family relations being the outward and visible expression of the <span class="greekheb">ὑποταγή</span> to which they are subject in domestic life. This is a more natural reference of <span class="greekheb">σεμνότ</span>. than to the general household arrangements, “<span class="ital">ut absit luxuria</span>” (Bengel). On the other hand there is much force in Dean Bernard’s remark that “<span class="greekheb">σεμνότης</span> is hardly a grace of childhood.” He connects <span class="greekheb">ἔχοντα μετὰ πασ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σεμν</span>.
