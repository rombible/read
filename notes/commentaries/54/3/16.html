Yes, confessedly great—so great that the massive grandeur of the pillar is only in proportion to the truth it supports.<p><span class= "bld">God was manifest in the flesh.</span>—Here, in the most ancient authorities, the word “God” does not occur. We must, then, literally translate the Greek of the most famous and trustworthy MSS. as follows: <span class= "ital">He who was manifested in the flesh.</span> In the later MSS., and in the great majority of the fathers who cite the passage, we certainly find <span class= "ital">Theos</span> (“God”), as in the Received text. The substitution can be traced to no special doctrinal prejudice, but is owing, probably, to a well-meant correction of early scribes. At first sight, <span class= "ital">Theos</span> (“God”) would be a reading easier to understand, and grammatically more exact; and in the original copies, the great similitude between <span class= "greekheb">ΘC</span> (“God”)—the contracted form in which <span class= "greekheb">ΘEOC</span> was written—and the relative <span class= "greekheb">ΘC</span> (“He who”), would be likely to suggest to an officious scribe the very trifling alteration necessary for the easier and apparently more accurate word. Recent investigations have shown, however, beyond controversy that the oldest MSS., with scarcely an exception, contain the more difficult reading, <span class= "greekheb">ΘC</span> (“He who”). The Greek pronoun thus rendered is simply a relative to an omitted but easily-inferred antecedent—viz., <span class= "ital">Christ.</span> Possibly the difficulty in the construction is due to the fact of the whole verse being a fragment of an ancient Christian hymn, embodying a confession of faith, well known to, and perhaps often sung by, the faithful among the congregations of such cities as Ephesus, Corinth, and Rome—a confession embodying the grand facts of the Incarnation and the Resurrection, the preaching of the cross to, and its reception by, the Gentile world, and the present session of Christ in glory. In the original Greek the rhythmical, as well as the antithetical character, of the clauses is very striking. In the English translation they can hardly be reproduced:—<p>“Who was manifested in the flesh,<p>justified in the Spirit,<p>seen of angels,<p>was preached among the Gentiles,<p>believed on in the world,<p>taken up into glory.”<p>Fragments of similar hymns to Christ are found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-11.htm" title="It is a faithful saying: For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him:">2Timothy 2:11</a>, and perhaps also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>.<p><span class= "bld">Manifest in the flesh.</span>—When the Son of God came forth from the Father “He was manifested in the flesh;” or, in other divine words, “the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only-begotten of the Father” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a>. Comp. also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-10.htm" title="But is now made manifest by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who has abolished death, and has brought life and immortality to light through the gospel:">2Timothy 1:10</a>). The men and women of the first days of Christianity who repeated or sang such words as these, must have accepted and firmly believed the dogma of the pre-existent glory of Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Justified in the Spirit.</span>—The truth of Jesus Christ’s own assertion respecting Himself, which <span class= "ital">seemed</span> to be contradicted by His mortal liability to bodily weakness, and pain and suffering, and last of all to death, in the end was triumphantly vindicated or justified. Or, in other words, the claims of Jesus Christ to Divinity, put forth during His life of humiliation, were shown to be true. It was by His resurrection from the dead that Christ’s lofty claims to the Godhead were justified. The Spirit, to which reference is here made, was the higher principle of spiritual life within Him—not itself the Divinity, but intimately united and associated with it. In the power of this Spirit, which he had within himself, He did take His life which He had laid down, did re-unite His soul unto His body from which He separated it when He gave up the ghost, and so did quicken and revive Himself, and thus publicly proclaimed His divine nature, His awful dignity. (Comp. Pearson, <span class= "ital">On the Creed, </span>Art. V.)<p><span class= "bld">Seen of angels . . .</span>—It has been suggested that “angels” mean here nothing more than His Apostles and His own chosen messengers, by whom Jesus Christ was <span class= "ital">seen</span> after His claims to Supreme power had been justified in the Spirit which had raised Him from the dead. These saw Him first, and after that carried the glad message to the distant isles of the Gentiles. But in spite of the ingenuity of such an exposition, the plain, obvious meaning of the word “angels “must be maintained, for the invariable meaning of <span class= "ital">angelos</span> in the New Testament (perhaps with the exception of the earlier chapters of the Apocalypse) is never “apostle,” but “angel.” He was “seen of angels”—that is, Jesus Christ, after His resurrection and return to the throne at the Father’s right hand, was, in His glorified humanity, visible to angels, who before had never looked on God. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm" title="To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they did minister the things, which are now reported to you by them that have preached the gospel to you with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels desire to look into.">1Peter 1:12</a>—each of which passages bears in some way on this mysterious subject.) Theodoret and St. Chrysostom have similarly commented on this statement respecting the angels’ share in the beatific vision.<p><span class= "bld">Preached unto the Gentiles.</span>—The angels now for the first time saw, and gazed on, and rejoiced in, the vision of the Godhead manifested in the glorified humanity of the Son; and what the angels gained in the beatific vision, the nations of the world obtained through the preaching of the gospel—viz., the knowledge of the endless love and the surpassing glory of Christ. This line of the ancient Christian hymn tells us that this early confession of faith was peculiarly the outcome of the Pauline churches; for in enumerating the six glories of the Redeemer God it tells us one of these glories consisted in the preaching of His gospel to those peoples who had hitherto sat in darkness and in the shadow of death. It was the splendid fulfilment of the Isaiah prophecy respecting the coming Messiah. “It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm" title="And he said, It is a light thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give you for a light to the Gentiles, that you may be my salvation to the end of the earth.">Isaiah 49:6</a>).<p><span class= "bld">Believed on in the world.</span>—Different from Buddhism or even from Mahommedanism, Christianity has found acceptance among widely different nationalities. The religion of the Crucified alone among religions has a fair claim to the title of a world-religion. Its cradle was in the East, but it rapidly found a ready acceptance in the West, and in the present day it may be said not only to exist, but to exercise a vast and ever increasing influence in all the four quarters of the globe.<p><span class= "bld">Received up into glory.</span>—More accurately, <span class= "ital">received up in glory.</span> These words refer evidently to the historical ascent of Christ into heaven—they declare the belief of these early churches in the fact of the Ascension as related in St. Luke’s Gospel.<p>This fragment of the triumph-song of the early churches embraces the leading facts of the Messianic story:—<p>(1) The Incarnation of the Son of God.<p>(2) The justification in His Resurrection of the lofty claims advanced by Him during the days of His humiliation.<p>(3) The Epiphany of the glorified Humanity of Christ.<p>(<span class= "ital">a</span>) To angels in the beatific vision.<p>(<span class= "ital">b</span>) To men in the preaching of the cross.<p>(4) The glorious results of the great sacrifice already visible in those first suffering, struggling days of the Church.<p>(5) The return to heaven, and the session in power at the right hand of God—<span class= "ital">closing</span> the first part of the blessed resurrection mystery, and <span class= "ital">beginning</span> the glorious reign of Christ over men from His throne in heaven.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:14-16 The church is the house of God; he dwells there. The church holds forth the Scripture and the doctrine of Christ, as a pillar holds forth a proclamation. When a church ceases to be the pillar and ground of truth, we may and ought to forsake her; for our regard to truth should be first and greatest. The mystery of godliness is Christ. He is God, who was made flesh, and was manifest in the flesh. God was pleased to manifest himself to man, by his own Son taking the nature of man. Though reproached as a sinner, and put to death as a malefactor, Christ was raised again by the Spirit, and so was justified from all the false charges with which he was loaded. Angels ministered to him, for he is the Lord of angels. The Gentiles welcomed the gospel which the Jews rejected. Let us remember that God was manifest in the flesh, to take away our sins, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. These doctrines must be shown forth by the fruits of the Spirit in our lives.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And, without controversy - Undeniably, certainly. The object of the apostle is to say that the truth which he was about to state admitted of no dispute.<p>Great is the mystery - On the meaning of the word "mystery," see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/2-7.htm">1 Corinthians 2:7</a>. The word means that which had been hidden or concealed. The meaning here is not that the proposition which he affirms was mysterious in the sense that it was unintelligible, or impossible to be understood; but that the doctrine respecting the incarnation and the work of the Messiah, which had been so long "kept hidden" from the world, was a subject of the deepest importance. This passage, therefore, should not be used to prove that there is anything unintelligible, or anything that surpasses human comprehension, in that doctrine, whatever may be the truth on that point; but that the doctrine which he now proceeds to state, and which had been so long concealed from mankind, was of the utmost consequence.<p>Of godliness - The word "godliness" means, properly, piety, reverence, or religiousness. It is used here, however, for the gospel scheme, to wit, that which the apostle proceeds to state. This "mystery," which had "been hidden from ages and from generations, and which was now manifest" <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>, was the great doctrine on which depended "religion" everywhere, or was that which constituted the Christian scheme.<p>God - Probably there is no passage in the New Testament which has excited so much discussion among critics as this, and none in reference to which it is so difficult to determine the true reading. It is the only one, it is believed, in which the microscope has been employed to determine the lines of the letters used in a manuscript; and, after all that has been done to ascertain the exact truth in regard to it, still the question remains undecided. It is not the object of these notes to enter into the examination of questions of this nature. A full investigation may be found in Wetstein. The question which has excited so much controversy is, whether the original Greek word was &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  Theos, "God," or whether it was &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;  hos, "who," or &#x3bf;&#788;  ho, "which." The controversy has turned, to a considerable degree, on the reading in the "Codex Alexandrinus;" and a remark or two on the method in which the manuscripts in the New Testament were written, will show the true nature of the controversy.<p>Greek manuscripts were formerly written entirely in capital letters, and without breaks or intervals between the words, and without accents; see a full description of the methods of writing the New Testament, in an article by Prof. Stuart in Dr. Robinson's Biblotheca Sacra, No. 2, pp. 254ff The small, cursive Greek letters which are now used, were not commonly employed in transcribing the New Testament, if at all, until the ninth or tenth centuries. It was a common thing to abridge or contract words in the manuscript. Thus, &#x3c0;&#x3c1; would be used for &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;  pater, "father;" &#x3ba;&#x3c2; for &#x3ba;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kurios, "Lord;" &#x398;&#x3c2; for &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  Theos, "God," etc. The words thus contracted were designated by a faint line or dash over them. In this place, therefore, if the original uncials (capitals) were &#x398;C, standing for &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;  Theos, "God," and the line in the &#x398;, and the faint line over it, were obliterated from any cause, it would easily be mistaken for OC - &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;  hos - "who."<p>To ascertain which of these is the true reading, has been the great question; and it is with reference to this that the microscope has been resorted to in the examination of the Alexandrian manuscript. It is now generally admitted that the faint line "over" the word has been added by some later hand, though not improbably by one who found that the line was nearly obliterated, and who meant merely to restore it. Whether the letter O was originally written with a line within it, making the reading "God," it is now said to be impossible to determine, in consequence of the manuscript at this place having become so much worn by frequent examination. The Vulgate and the Syriac read it: "who," or "which." The Vulgate is, "Great is the sacrament of piety which was manifested in the flesh." The Syriac, "Great is the mystery of godliness, that he was manifested in the flesh." The "probability" in regard to the correct reading here, as it seems to me, is, that the word, as originally written, was &#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2;  Theos - "God." At the same time, however, the evidence is not so clear that it can be properly used in an argument. But the passage is not "necessary" to prove the doctrine which is affirmed, on the supposition that that is the correct reading. The same truth is abundantly taught elsewhere; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/1-23.htm">Matthew 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>.<p>Was manifest - Margin, "Manifested." The meaning is, "appeared" in the flesh.<p>In the flesh - In human nature; see this explained in the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>. The expression here looks as though the true reading of the much-disputed word was "God." It could not have been, it would seem evident, &#x3bf;&#788;  ho, "which," referring to "mystery;" for how could a mystery "be manifested in the flesh?" Nor could it it be &#x3bf;&#788;&#769;&#x3c2;  hos, "who," unless that should refer to one who was more than a man; for how absurd would it be to say that "a man was manifested, or appeared in the flesh!" How else could a man appear? The phrase here means that God appeared in human form, or with human nature; and this is declared to be the "great" truth so long concealed from human view, but now revealed as constituting the fundamental doctrine of the gospel. The expressions which follow in this verse refer to God "as" thus manifested in the flesh; to the Saviour as he appeared on earth, regarded as a divine and human being. It was the fact that he thus appeared and sustained this character, which made the things which are immediately specified so remarkable, and so worthy of attention.<p>Justified in the Spirit - That is, the incarnate person above referred to; the Redeemer, regarded as God and man. The word "Spirit," here, it is evident, refers to the Holy Spirit, because:<p>(1) it is not possible to attach any intelligible idea to the phrase, "he was justified by his own spirit, or soul;"<p>(2) as the Holy Spirit performed so important a part in the work of Christ, it is natural to suppose there would be some allusion here to him; and,<p>(3) as the "angels" are mentioned here as having been with him, and as the Holy Spirit is often mentioned in connection with him, it is natural to suppose that there would be some allusion to Him here. The word "justified," here, is not used in the sense in which it is when applied to Christians, but in its more common signification. It means to "vindicate," and the sense is, that he was shown to be the Son of God by the agency of the Holy Spirit; he was thus vindicated from the charges alleged against him. The Holy Spirit furnished the evidence that he was the Son of God, or "justified" his claims. Thus he descended on him at his baptism, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-16.htm">Matthew 3:16</a>; he was sent to convince the world of sin because it did not believe on him, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/16-8.htm">John 16:8-9</a>; the Saviour cast out devils by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-28.htm">Matthew 12:28</a>; the Spirit was given to him without measure, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/3-34.htm">John 3:34</a>, and the Spirit was sent down in accordance with his promise, to convert the hearts of people; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-33.htm">Acts 2:33</a>. All the manifestations of God to him; all the power of working miracles by his agency; all the influences imparted to the man Christ Jesus, endowing him with such wisdom as man never had before, may be regarded as an attestation of the Holy Spirit to the divine mission of the Lord Jesus, and of course as a vindication from all the charges against him. In like manner, the descent of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and his agency in the conversion of every sinner, prove the same thing, and furnish the grand argument in vindication of the Redeemer that he was sent from God. To this the apostle refers as a part of the glorious truth of the Christian scheme now revealed - the "mystery of religion;" as a portion of the amazing records, the memory of which the church was to preserve as connected with the redemption of the world.<p>Seen of angels - They were attendants on his ministry, and came to him in times of distress, peril, and want; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/2-9.htm">Luke 2:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-4.htm">Luke 24:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/4-11.htm">Matthew 4:11</a>. They felt an interest in him and his work, and they gladly came to him in his sorrows and troubles. The design of the apostle is to give an impressive view of the grandeur and glory of that work which attracted the attention of the heavenly hosts, and which drew them from the skies that they might proclaim his advent, sustain him in his temptations, witness his crucifixion, and watch over him in the tomb. The work of Christ, though despised by people, excited the deepest interest in heaven; compare notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>.<p>Preached unto the Gentiles - This is placed by the apostle among the "great" things which constituted the "mystery" of religion. The meaning is, that it was a glorious truth that salvation might be, and should be, proclaimed to all mankind, and that this was a part of the important truths made known in the gospel. Elsewhere this is called, by way of eminence, "the mystery of the gospel;" that is, the grand truth which had not been known until the coming of the Saviour; see the <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/6-19.htm">Ephesians 6:19</a> note; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26-27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a> notes. Before his coming, a wall of partition had divided the Jewish and Gentile world. The Jews regarded the rest of mankind as excluded from the covenant mercies of God, and it was one of the principal stumblingblocks in their way, in regard to the gospel, that it proclaimed that all the race was on a level, that that middle wall of partition was broken down, and that salvation might now be published to all people; compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/22-21.htm">Acts 22:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/2-14.htm">Ephesians 2:14-15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-22.htm">Romans 3:22</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/10-11.htm">Romans 10:11-20</a>.<p>continued...<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16. And&#8212;following up 1Ti 3:15: The pillar of the truth is the Church in which thou art required to minister; "AND (that thou mayest know how grand is that truth which the Church so upholds) confessedly (so the Greek for 'without controversy') great is the mystery of godliness: (namely), He who (so the oldest manuscripts and versions read for 'God') was manifested in (the) flesh (He who) was justified in the Spirit," &c. There is set before us the whole dignity of Christ's person. If He were not essentially superhuman (Tit 2:13), how could the apostle emphatically declare that He was manifested in (the) flesh? [Tregelles, Printed Text of the Greek New Testament]. (Joh 1:14; Php 2:7; 1Jo 1:2; 4:2). Christ, in all His aspects, is Himself "the mystery of godliness." He who before was hidden "with God" was made manifest (Joh 1:1, 14; Ro 16:25, 26; Col 1:26; 2Ti 1:10; Tit 2:11; 3:4; 1Jo 3:5, 8). "Confessedly," that is, by the universal confession of the members of "the Church," which is in this respect the "pillar" or upholder "of the truth."<p>the mystery&#8212;the divine scheme embodied in Christ (Col 1:27), once hidden from, but now revealed to, us who believe.<p>of godliness&#8212;rather, "piety"; a different Greek, expresses godliness (1Ti 2:10). In opposition to the ungodliness or impiety inseparable from error (departure from the faith: "doctrines of devils," "profane fables," 1Ti 4:1, 7; compare 1Ti 6:3). To the victims of such error, the "mystery of piety" (that is, Christ Himself) remains a mystery unrevealed (1Ti 4:2). It is accessible only to "piety" (1Ti 3:9): in relation to the pious it is termed a "mystery," though revealed (1Co 2:7-14), to imply the excellence of Him who is the surpassing essential subject of it, and who is Himself "wonderful" (Isa 9:6), surpassing knowledge (Eph 3:18, 19); compare Eph 5:32. The apostle now proceeds to unfold this confessedly great mystery in its details. It is not unlikely that some formula of confession or hymn existed in the Church and was generally accepted, to which Paul alludes in the words "confessedly great is the mystery," &c. (to wit), "He who was manifested," &c. Such hymns were then used (compare Eph 5:19; Col 3:16). Pliny [1.10, Epistle, 97], "They are wont on a fixed day before dawn to meet and sing a hymn in alternate responses to Christ, as being God"; and Eusebius [Ecclesiastical History, 5.28]. The short unconnected sentences with the words similarly arranged, and the number of syllables almost equal, and the ideas antithetically related, are characteristics of a Christian hymn. The clauses stand in parallelism; each two are connected as a pair, and form an antithesis turning on the opposition of heaven to earth; the order of this antithesis is reversed in each new pair of clauses: flesh and spirit, angels and Gentiles, world and glory; and there is a correspondence between the first and the last clause: "manifested in the flesh, received up into glory" [Wiesinger].<p>justified&#8212;that is, approved to be righteous [Alford]. Christ, while "in the flesh," seemed to be just such a one as men in the flesh, and in fact bore their sins; but by having died to sin, and having risen again, He gained for Himself and His people justifying righteousness (Isa 50:8; Joh 16:10; Ac 22:14; Ro 4:25; 6:7, 10; Heb 9:28; 1Pe 3:18; 4:1 1Jo 2:1) [Bengel]; or rather, as the antithesis to "was manifest in the flesh" requires, He was justified in the Spirit at the same time that He was manifest in the flesh, that is, He was vindicated as divine "in His Spirit," that is, in His higher nature; in contrast to "in the flesh," His visible human nature. This contrasted opposition requires "in the Spirit" to be thus explained: not "by the Spirit," as Alford explains it. So Ro 1:3, 4, "Made of the seed of David according to the flesh, and declared to be the Son of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the resurrection from the dead." So "justified" is used to mean vindicated in one's true character (Mt 11:19; Lu 7:35; Ro 3:4). His manifestation "in the flesh" exposed him to misapprehension, as though he were nothing more (Joh 6:41; 7:27). His justification, or vindication, in respect to His Spirit or higher being, was effected by ALL that manifested that higher being, His words (Mt 7:29; Joh 7:46), His works (Joh 2:11; 3:2), by His Father's testimony at His baptism (Mt 3:17), and at the transfiguration (Mt 17:5), and especially by His resurrection (Ac 13:33; Ro 1:4), though not by this exclusively, as Bengel limits it.<p>seen of angels&#8212;answering to "preached unto the Gentiles" (or rather "among the nations"; including the Jews), on the other hand (Mt 28:19; Ro 16:25, 26). "Angels saw the Son of God with us, not having seen Him before" [Chrysostom].' "not even they had seen His divine nature, which is not visible to any creature, but they saw Him incarnate" [Theodoret] (Eph 3:8, 10; 1Pe 1:12; compare Col 1:16, 20). What angels came to know by seeing, the nations learned by preaching. He is a new message to the one class as well as to the other; in the wondrous union in His person of things most opposite, namely, heaven and earth, lies "the mystery" [Wiesinger]. If the English Version, "Gentiles," be retained, the antithesis will be between the angels who are so near the Son of God, the Lord of "angels," and the Gentiles who were so utterly "afar off" (Eph 2:17).<p>believed on in the world&#8212;which lieth in wickedness (1Jo 2:15; 5:19). Opposed to "glory" (Joh 3:16, 17). This followed upon His being "preached" (Ro 10:14).<p>received up into glory&#8212;Greek, "in glory." However, English Version may be retained thus, "Received up (so as now to be) in glory," that is, into glory (Mr 16:19; Lu 24:51; Ac 1:11).

What follows is so, the incarnation of Christ, his birth of a virgin, the union of the two natures, divine and human, in his person; this is a mystery, which though revealed, and so to be believed, is not to be discerned nor accounted for, nor the modus of it to be comprehended by reason: and it is a great one, next, if not equal, to the doctrine of a trinity of persons in the divine essence; and is a mystery of godliness, which tends to encourage internal and external religion, powerful and practical godliness in all the parts and branches of it; and is so beyond all dispute and doubt. <p>God was manifest in the flesh; not God essentially considered, or Deity in the abstract, but personally; and not the first nor the third Person; for of neither of them can this or the following things be said; but the second Person, the Word, or Son of God; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a> who existed as a divine Person, and as a distinct one from the Father and Spirit, before his incarnation; and which is a proof of his true and proper deity: the Son of God in his divine nature is equally invisible as the Father, but became manifest by the assumption of human nature in a corporeal way, so as to be seen, heard, and felt: and by "flesh" is meant, not that part of the body only, which bears that name, nor the whole body only, but the whole human nature, consisting of a true body and a reasonable soul; so called, partly to denote the frailty of it, and to show that it was not a person, but a nature, Christ assumed; and the clause is added, not so much to distinguish this manifestation of Christ from a spiritual manifestation of him to his people, as in distinction from all other manifestations of him in the Old Testament, in an human form for a time, and in the cloud, both in the tabernacle and temple. This clause is a very apt and full interpretation of the word "Moriah", the name of the mount in which Jehovah would manifest himself, and be seen, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/22-2.htm">Genesis 22:2</a>. <p>Justified in the Spirit; either by the Spirit of God, making his human nature pure and holy, and preserving it from original sin and taint; and by descending on him at his baptism, thereby testifying that he was the Son of God; and by the miracles wrought by his power, which proved Jesus to be the Messiah against those that rejected him; and by his coming down upon the apostles at Pentecost; and who in their ministry vindicated him from all the aspersions cast upon him: or else it is to be understood of the divine nature of Christ, in distinction from his flesh or human nature; in the one he was manifest and put to death for the sins of his people, which were put upon him, and bore by him; and by the other he was quickened and declared to be the Son of God; and being raised from the dead, he was justified and acquitted from all the sins of his people, and they were justified in him; he having made full satisfaction to justice for them. <p>Seen of angels; meaning not ministers of the Gospel, and pastors of churches, who are sometimes so called; but the blessed spirits, the inhabitants of heaven: by these he was seen at his birth, who then descended and sung praise to God on that account; and in the wilderness, after he had been tempted by Satan, when they ministered unto him; and in the garden upon his agony and sweat there, when one appeared and strengthened him; and at his resurrection from the dead, who rolled away the stone from the sepulchre, and told the women he was risen from the dead; as also at his ascension to heaven, when they attended him thither in triumph; and now in heaven, where they wait upon him, and worship him, and are ministering spirits, sent forth by him to do his pleasure; and he is seen by them the ministry of the Gospel; into the truths of which they look with pleasure, and gaze upon with unutterable delight and admiration; especially those which respect the person and offices of Christ. Some copies read, "seen of men", but that is implied in the first clause: <p>preached unto the Gentiles; the worst of men, and that by the express orders of Christ himself; and which was foretold in the prophecies of the Old Testament, and yet was a mystery, hid from ages and generations past: <p>believed on in the world; among the Jews, and in the nations of the world, so that he was preached with success; and faith in Christ is the end of preaching; though this is not of a man's self, but is the gift of God, and the operation of his power: and it was a marvellous thing, considering the reproach and ignominy Christ lay under, through the scandal of the cross, that he should be believed on as he was. This can be ascribed to nothing else but to the power of God, which went along with the ministry of the word. <p>Received up into glory; he was raised from the dead, and had a glory put upon his risen body; he ascended in a glorious manner to heaven, in a cloud, and in chariots of angels, and was received there with a welcome by his Father; and is set down at his right hand, and crowned with glory and honour, and glorified with the glory he had with him before the world was. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{8}</span> And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.</span><p>(8) There is nothing more excellent than this truth, of which the Church is the keeper and preserver here among men, the ministry of the word being appointed to that end and purpose: for it teaches us the greatest matters that may be thought, that is, that God has become visible in the person of Christ by taking our nature upon him, whose majesty, even though in such great weakness, was manifested in many ways, in so much that the sight of it pierced the very angels.

It is so called by the apostle, because, as the substance of the Christian fear of God, or piety, it is hidden from the world: the sense is the same, therefore, as that of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῸ ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ Τῆς ΠΊΣΤΕΩς</span></span></span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm" title="Holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience.">1 Timothy 3:9</a>. It is wrong to translate it, as Luther does: “the blessed secret,” or to explain it: “the doctrine which leads to godliness.” Wiesinger is incorrect in explaining it: “a secret accessible only to godliness;” and Hofmann in saying: “the truth which is of such a nature as to produce godliness where it finds acceptance.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The purport—<span class="ital">i.e.</span> the christological purport—is now given in the next clauses, Paul laying stress on it on account of the polemical tendency of the epistle against the heretics (chap. 4), whose theology and Christology were in contradiction with the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the construction of these clauses, there would be no difficulty with the reading <span class="greekheb">Θεός</span>. If <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὅ</span></span></span> be read, it must relate to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span>, which also might be the construction with <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">Ὅς</span></span></span>. According to the Vulgate (sacramentum quod manifestatum est), the latter is the construction adopted by the Latin Fathers who understood Christ to be the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΜΥΣΤΉΡΙΟΝ</span></span></span>,[144]—an interpretation quite unjustifiable and unsuitable to the general train of thought. Several expositors (Mangold, Hofmann, and others) assume the first clause: <span class="greekheb">ὃς</span> … <span class="greekheb">σαρκί</span>, to be the subject, and the other five clauses to form the predicate; but “on account of the parallelism, that is not advisable” (Winer, p. 519 [E. T. p. 736]). It is much more natural from their similar form to regard all six clauses as co-ordinate. Then the subject to which <span class="greekheb">ὅς</span> relates is not named; but, according to the purport of the various clauses, it can be none other than Christ. This curious omission may be thus accounted for; the sentence has been taken from a formula of confession, or better, from an old Christian hymn, as its metrical and euphonious character seems to indicate; comp. Rambach’s <span class="ital">Anthologie christl. Gesänge aus allen Jahrh. d. Kirche</span>, I. 33, and Winer, p. 547 [E. T. p. 797]. This view is also adopted by Heydenreich, Mack, de Wette, Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Plitt.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The opinion of Matthies is untenable, that the apostle does not name Christ expressly, in order to maintain the character of <span class="greekheb">τὸ μυστήριον</span> (in the sense: Acknowledged great, etc., … he who is revealed, etc.), and that this absolute use of the relative pronoun is found elsewhere in the N. T. In the passages quoted by him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-23.htm" title="You that make your boast of the law, through breaking the law dishonor you God?">Romans 2:23</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/7-37.htm" title="Nevertheless he that stands steadfast in his heart, having no necessity, but has power over his own will, and has so decreed in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.">1 Corinthians 7:37</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-46.htm" title="And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth?

The first clause runs: <span class="greekheb">ἐφανερώθη ἐν σαρκί</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐφανερώθη</span> is often used of Christ’s appearance on earth, of His becoming man, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm" title="(For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear witness, and show to you that eternal life, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us;)">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm" title="And you know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and in him is no sin.">1 John 3:5</a>; it presupposes a previous concealment,[145] and consequently the pre-existence of Christ as the eternal Logos.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">Ἐν σαρκί</span>] (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm" title="Hereby know you the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:">1 John 4:2</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐληλυθὼς ἐν σαρκί</span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm" title="For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh:">Romans 8:3</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἐν ὁμοιώματι σαρκὸς ἁμαρτίας</span>) denotes the human nature in which Christ appeared; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm" title="And the Word was made flesh, and dwelled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.">John 1:14</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὁ λόγος σὰρξ ἐγένετο</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>With this first clause the second stands in contrast: <span class="greekheb">ἐδικαιώθη ἐν πνεύματι</span>] means (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm" title="The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a drunkard, a friend of publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/7-35.htm" title="But wisdom is justified of all her children.">Luke 7:35</a>): to be shown to be such a one as He is in nature; here, therefore, the sense is: He was shown in His divine glory (as the Logos or eternal Son of God), which was veiled by the <span class="greekheb">σάρξ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Ἐν πνεύματι</span> is contrasted with <span class="greekheb">ἐν σαρκί</span>, the latter denoting the earthly, human manner of His appearing, the former the inner principle which formed the basis of His life. Though <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span> with <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> has not entirely lost its proper meaning, yet it shades off into the idea of the means used, in so far as the spirit revealed in Him was the means of showing His true nature.[146] It would be wrong to separate here the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> from His person, and to understand by it the spirit proceeding from Him and imparted to His own; it is rather the living spiritual principle dwelling in Him and working out from Him (so, too, Plitt).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Chrysostom diverges from this exposition, and explains <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΔΙΚΑΙΏΘΗ</span></span></span> by: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΌΛΟΝ ΟὐΚ ἘΠΟΊΗΣΕΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὍΠΕΡ Ὁ ΠΡΟΦΉΤΗς ΛΈΓΕΙ</span>· <span class="greekheb">Ὃς ἉΜΑΡΤΊΑΝ ΟὐΚ ἘΠΟΊΗΣΕ</span></span></span>; and Bengel takes the meaning of the expression to be that Christ bore the sins of the world (peccata peccatorum tulit … et justitiam aeternam sibi suisque asseruit); but both views import ideas which are here out of place. The expression <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span> has also found very varying interpretations. Instead of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> being taken in its real sense, particular elements of it in the life of Christ, or particular modes of revealing the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span>, have been fixed upon, or <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΝΕῦΜΑ</span></span></span> has been taken simply of the divine nature of Christ.[147]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ ἈΓΓΈΛΟΙς</span></span></span>] The right meaning of this third clause also can only be got from a faithful consideration of the words. The word <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ</span></span></span> is in the N. T. frequently joined with the dative, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm" title="And, behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking with him.">Matthew 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm" title="And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.">Luke 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm" title="And he said, Men, brothers, and fathers, listen; The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelled in Charran,">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_corinthians/15-5.htm" title="And that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:...">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm" title="So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and to them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin to salvation.">Hebrews 9:28</a>, etc. In all these passages it is not the simple “was seen,” but “was revealed” or “appeared;” it always presupposes the activity of the thing seen.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>From the analogy of these passages, we must think here of Christ going to those to whom He became visible, so that all explanations which take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ</span></span></span> merely as “was seen” are to be rejected.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>In the N. T. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ</span></span></span> is especially applied to angels; in itself the word may also denote human messengers (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-25.htm" title="Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works, when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out another way?">Jam 2:25</a>). To take it here in this latter sense (which Hofmann does), as denoting the apostles to whom Christ appeared after His resurrection, is impossible, because nothing, not even the article, is used here to point to them in particular. If, then, <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ</span></span></span> can only mean angels, it is most natural to take <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ ἈΓΓΈΛΟΙς</span></span></span> of the ascension, by which Christ—as the Glorified One—was made manifest to angels (so, too, Plitt). Still there is nothing here to lay stress on the ascension (as is done in the sixth clause); the point is, that He who was justified <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΝΕΎΜΑΤΙ</span></span></span> presented Himself to the angels in His glory.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Baur, indeed, in gnostic fashion interprets the passage of Christ as passing through the various series of aeons, but it is clear that the words neither demand nor even justify such a view. No less arbitrary is de Wette’s opinion, that probably the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὨΦΘῆΝΑΙ ἈΓΓΈΛΟΙς</span></span></span> relates to a supernatural scene differing from the ascension, and forming the antithesis to the descent into hell.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The very form of the expression shows that we are not to think of appearances of angels at various moments in the earthly life of Christ, as some expositors suppose. More noteworthy is an explanation given by Chrysostom and approved by some later expositors, especially by Matthies and Wiesinger. Chrysostom says: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὬΦΘΗ ἈΓΓΈΛΟΙς</span>· <span class="greekheb">ὭΣΤΕ ΚΑῚ ἌΓΓΕΛΟΙ ΜΕΘʼ ἩΜῶΝ ΕἾΔΟΝ ΤῸΝ ΥἹῸΝ ΤΟῦ ΘΕΟῦ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΠΡΌΤΕΡΟΝ ΟὐΧ ὉΡῶΝΤΕς</span></span></span>. Theodoret’s expression is still more pointed: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΤῊΝ ΓᾺΡ ἈΌΡΑΤΟΝ Τῆς ΘΕΌΤΗΤΟς ΦΎΣΙΝ ΟὐΔῈ ἘΚΕῖΝΟΙ ἙΏΡΩΝ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΣΑΡΚΩΘΈΝΤΑ ΔῈ ἘΘΕΆΣΑΝΤΟ</span></span></span>. Matthies appeals to passages which he thinks are elucidated by the words, passages where Christ is said to have been manifested as … head to all things in heaven and on earth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/1-20.htm" title="Which he worked in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places,">Ephesians 1:20</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-8.htm" title="Why he said, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts to men.">Ephesians 4:8</a> ff.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-15.htm" title=" Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:">Colossians 1:15</a> ff; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-10.htm" title=" And you are complete in him, which is the head of all principality and power:">Colossians 2:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-15.htm" title=" And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it.">Colossians 2:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm" title="And again, when he brings in the first-begotten into the world, he said, And let all the angels of God worship him.">Hebrews 1:6</a> ff. But, though Christ’s lordship over all is spoken of in such passages, it is not said that Christ was made manifest to the angels only by means of His incarnation. The only passage which might be quoted here is <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-10.htm" title="To the intent that now to the principalities and powers in heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God,">Ephesians 3:10</a>, which, however, rather declares that to the angels the eternal decree of the divine love or of God’s wisdom was to be made known <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙᾺ Τῆς ἘΚΚΛΗΣΊΑς</span></span></span>. But <span class="ital">such</span> cannot possibly be the meaning of <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις</span>. Wiesinger simply explains it: “the angels saw the <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΣΑΡΚΩΘΈΝΤΑ</span></span></span> on earth;” but obviously the sentence is meant to express something which befell not men, but <span class="ital">angels</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκηρύχθη ἐν ἔθνεσιν</span>] for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΚΗΡΎΧΘΗ</span></span></span>, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm" title="Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:">Php 1:15</a>; and for <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ἜΘΝΕΣΙΝ</span></span></span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-19.htm" title="Go you therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:">Matthew 28:19</a>.

It is enough to mention without discussion the opinions that <span class="greekheb">πνεύματι</span> refers (<span class="ital">a</span>) to the Holy Spirit, or (<span class="ital">b</span>) to the Divine Personality of Christ.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις</span>: Ellicott points out that in these three pairs of clauses, the first member of each group points to <span class="ital">earthly</span> relations, the second to <span class="ital">heavenly</span>. So that these words <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη ἀγγέλοις</span> refer to the fact that the Incarnation was “a spectacle to angels” as well as “to men”; or rather, as Dean Bernard notes (<span class="ital">Comm. in loc</span>.), <span class="greekheb">ὤφθη</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐκηρύχθη</span> mark the difference in the communication of the Christian Revelation to angels—the rational creatures nearest to God—and to the Gentiles—farthest from God. “The revelation to Gentiles is <span class="ital">mediate</span>, by preaching …; the revelation to the higher orders of created intelligences is <span class="ital">immediate</span>, by vision.” It was as much a source of wonderment to the latter as to the former.

Since the minute inspection of the Alexandrine ms. by Bps Lightfoot, Ellicott, and others, there is no doubt of its original reading being ‘who,’ as is also the reading of <span class="greekheb">א</span>, and all the Versions older than the 7th century, of Origen, Epiphanius, Jerome, Theodore, and Cyril. The neuter relative is indeed found in one uncial ms. (D1) in the It. and Vulg. and in all the Latin Fathers except Jerome, a correction apparently to make it agree with the neuter word <span class="ital">mustêrion</span>. The support of mss., Versions and Fathers is comparatively weak for ‘God’: while ‘it is a most significant fact that in the Arian controversy, no one of the Catholic champions except Gregory of Nyssa produces this passage, though it would have been their strong weapon.’ All the evidence preponderates in favour of a relative masc. or neut., and it seems incredible that <span class="greekheb">θσ</span> should have been altered into <span class="greekheb">οσ</span> because of the difficulty of the reading. Moreover it is difficult to understand how it could be said that <span class="ital">God</span> was justified in spirit or seen of angels or received up in glory. We take the reading ‘who’ unhesitatingly, and refer it to ‘an omitted though easily recognised antecedent, viz. Christ.’ The Person is implied in the Mystery. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm" title=" To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:">Colossians 1:27</a>, He is expressly called ‘this mystery among the Gentiles.’ In order to bring out the personal reference contained in the word ‘mystery’ as followed by the masculine relative, we must render in English with R.V. <span class="bld">the mystery of godliness; He who</span>. The abruptness and the rhythmical parallelism of the passage have been very probably accounted for by supposing it to be part of one of the earliest of the Christian creeds or hymns; as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-14.htm" title="Why he said, Awake you that sleep, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give you light.">Ephesians 5:14</a>, ‘Wherefore <span class="ital">he</span> saith “Awake thou that sleepest” ’ where the words cannot be referred to any known passages of Holy Scripture. Westcott and Hort in their new critical edition of the Greek Testament have arranged the lines in both places according to this explanation; here in two divisions, the first two clauses in each pointing to <span class="ital">earthly</span>, the third to <span class="ital">heavenly</span> relation:—<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘He Who was manifested in the flesh,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Was justified in His spirit,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Was shewn to the angels,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Was proclaimed among the nations,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Was believed on in the world,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Was taken up in glory.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The clauses have been however divided by Fairbairn and others into <span class="ital">pairs</span>; the first pair describing Christ’s human nature—<span class="ital">in flesh</span> manifested as true man, <span class="ital">in spirit</span> judged or approved as sinless man ‘fulfilling all righteousness’; the second pair recording the revelation of Himself by sight to the angels, by preaching to the Gentiles—the highest and the lowest of His subjects; the third pair closing with the acceptance of Himself by faith below, by ascension into glory above. We may shew something perhaps of the rhythmical effect thus for modern ears:<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Who in <span class="ital">flesh</span> was manifested,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Pure in <span class="ital">spirit</span> was attested;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By angels’ vision witnessèd,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Among the nations heralded;<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>By faith accepted here,<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Received in glory there!’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>‘Manifested in the flesh’ is the first part of the statement of the Incarnation; ‘an historical appearance of One Who had previously existed but had been kept from the knowledge of the world’; the flesh, the material part of Christ’s human nature being the sphere of His manifestation. ‘Justified in the spirit’ is the second part; His spirit, the highest portion of the immaterial part of His human nature, is the sphere of His justification; the challenge which He made to the Jews, ‘Which of you convicteth Me of sin’ was one which He could make to <span class="ital">His own conscience</span>. He was <span class="ital">justified</span> when it spake and clear when it judged (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/3-4.htm" title="God forbid: yes, let God be true, but every man a liar; as it is written, That you might be justified in your sayings, and might overcome when you are judged.">Romans 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-4.htm" title="Against you, you only, have I sinned, and done this evil in your sight: that you might be justified when you speak, and be clear when you judge.">Psalm 51:4</a>).

It is always mysteries (or mystery) of the kingdom of God, of Christ, of God, of the gospel, and the like. In the following passages the objective sense of <span class="greek">&#x1f20;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> is either necessary or by far the most natural: <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/3-7.htm">Acts 3:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/13-8.htm">Acts 13:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/14-22.htm">Acts 14:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-5.htm">Acts 16:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/1-23.htm">Galatians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-5.htm">Ephesians 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/1-27.htm">Philippians 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-7.htm">Colossians 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm">2 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-13.htm">Titus 1:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-1.htm">James 2:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-3.htm">Jude 1:3</a>. Having thus exalted the "mystery of godliness," St. Paul goes on to expound it. <span class="cmt_word">He who</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>). This is generally adopted now as the true reading, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x1f79;&#x3c2;</span> (<span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, instead of <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>). Bishop Ellicott satisfied himself, by most careful personal examination, that the original reading of the Cod. Alex. was <span class="greek">&#x39f;&#x3a3;</span>, and that it had been altered by a later hand to <span class="greek">&#x398;&#x3a3;</span>. The Cod. Sinait certainly has <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c2;</span>, and to this all the older versions agree. The Vulgate has <span class="accented">quod</span>, agreeing with <span class="accented">sacramentum</span> and representing the Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f41;</span> Accepting this, then, as the true reading, we proceed to explain it. <span class="greek">&#x1f4d;&#x3c2;</span>, who, is a relative, and must, therefore, have an antecedent. But there is no expressed antecedent of the masculine gender for it to agree with. The antecedent, therefore, must be understood, and gathered from the preceding words, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x20;&#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x1f75;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c4;&#x1fc6;&#x3c2;</span> <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f50;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;</span>. It can only be Christ. The mystery of the whole Old Testament, that which was wrapped in types and hidden under veils, was Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>). Moses spake of him, the Psalms speak of him, the prophets speak of him; but all of them spake darkly. But in the gospel "the mystery of Christ" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/4-3.htm">Colossians 4:3</a>)is revealed. Christ is the Mystery of Christianity. It is, therefore, no difficult step to pass from "the mystery" to "Christ," and to supply the word "Christ" as the antecedent to "who." <span class="cmt_word">Was manifested</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span>); a word frequently applied to Christ (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-31.htm">John 1:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-2.htm">1 John 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5, 8</a>, etc.). The idea is the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Justified in the spirit.</span> This is rather an obscure expression. But it seems to describe our Lord's spotless righteousness, perhaps with special reference to the declaration of it at his baptism, "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." We have the same contrast between the flesh and the Spirit of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-18.htm">1 Peter 3:18</a>. And between the flesh and the spirit of a Christian man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-10.htm">Romans 8:10</a>, "The body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness." To this clause apparently the remark of Chrysostom applies, "God became man, and man became God." "The spirit" seems to mean the moral nature - the inner man. <span class="cmt_word">Seen of angels.</span> Perhaps the multitude of the heavenly host who welcomed the birth of Christ were permitted to see the new-born Babe, as he seems to have done who described him to the shepherds as "wrapped in swaddling clothes" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-12.htm">Luke 2:12-14</a>). Angels ministered unto him after the temptation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/1-13.htm">Mark 1:13</a>), and in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-43.htm">Luke 22:43</a>, where the word <span class="greek">&#x1f64;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;</span> is used), and at his resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/28-2.htm">Matthew 28:2</a>). The special interest of angels in the "<span class="accented">great mystery"</span> is referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-12.htm">1 Peter 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-6.htm">Hebrews 1:6</a>. <span class="cmt_word">Preached among the nations</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3c7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f14;&#x3b8;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). It would have been better to keep the rendering "Gentiles" here, to mark the identity of thought with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/3-6.htm">Ephesians 3:6, 8</a>, where, in the apostle's view, the preaching of the gospel to the Gentiles, that they might be fellow-heirs with the Jews of the promises of God, is one main feature of the mystery (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm">1 Timothy 2:7</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Believed on in the world.</span> The next step in this ascending scale is the acceptance of Christ in the world as the Savior thereof. The language here is not stronger than that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-5.htm">Colossians 1:5, 6</a>, "The word of the truth of the gospel, which is come unto you; even as it is also in all the world, and beareth fruit." And in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-23.htm">Colossians 1:23</a>, "The gospel which was preached in all creation under heaven" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-8.htm">Romans 1:8</a>). The statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/mark/16-15.htm">Mark 16:15-20</a> might almost have been in St. Paul's mind. Note the use there of the words <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x20;&#x1f10;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x1f7b;&#x3be;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>, <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x1f78;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x1f40;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x1f75;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;</span>. <span class="accented"><span class="cmt_word"></span>Received up in glory.</span> The change of "into" (A.V.) into "in" is of very doubtful propriety. In New Testament Greek <span class="greek">&#x1f10;&#x3bd;</span>, frequently follows verbs of motion, and means the same as <span class="greek">&#x3b5;&#x1f30;&#x3c2;</span>, like the Hebrew <span class="hebrew">&#x5d1;&#x5bc;&#x5b0;</span>. Our Lord is net said to have ascended <span class="accented">in glory</span> (as he appeared at the Transfiguration), but, as St. Mark has it, "He was received up into heaven, and [there] sat down at the right hand of God," fulfilling <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-5.htm">John 17:5</a>. This grand burst of dogmatic teaching is somewhat like that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5-7</a>. There is no adequate evidence of its being, as many commentators have thought, a portion of a hymn or creed used in the Church. It rather implies the same tension in the apostle's mind which is apparent in other parts of the Epistle (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm">1 Timothy 6:11</a> and following verses). <p> <p> <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/3.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Without controversy (&#x3bf;&#788;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#x3c2;)<p>Lit. confessedly. N.T.o.<p>The mystery of godliness (&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#768; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3bc;&#x3c5;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;)<p>(a) The connection of thought is with the truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm">1 Timothy 3:15</a>), and the words mystery of godliness are a paraphrase of that word. The church is the pillar and stay of the truth, and the truth constitutes the mystery of godliness. (b) The contents of this truth or mystery is Christ, revealed in the gospel as the Savior from ungodliness, the norm and inspiration of godliness, the divine life in man, causing him to live unto God as Christ did and does (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-10.htm">Romans 6:10</a>). See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-15.htm">1 Timothy 1:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-5.htm">1 Timothy 2:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/colossians/1-26.htm">Colossians 1:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/1-27.htm">Colossians 1:27</a>. According to the Fourth Gospel, Christ is himself the truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/14-6.htm">John 14:6</a>). The mystery of godliness is the substance of piety  equals  mystery of the faith (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-9.htm">1 Timothy 3:9</a>). (c) The truth is called a mystery because it was, historically, hidden, until revealed in the person and work of Christ; also because it is concealed from human wisdom, and apprehended only by faith in the revelation of God through Christ. (d) The genitive, of godliness, is possessive. The mystery of godliness is the truth which pertains or belongs to godliness. It is not the property of worldly wisdom. Great (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;) means important, weighty, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-32.htm">Ephesians 5:32</a>.<p>God (&#x398;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3c2;)<p>But the correct reading is &#x3bf;&#788;&#768;&#x3c2; who. The antecedent of this relative is not mystery, as if Christ were styled "the mystery," but the relative refers to Christ as an antecedent; and the abruptness of its introduction may be explained by the fact that it and the words which follow were probably taken from an ancient credal hymn. In the earlier Christian ages it was not unusual to employ verse or rhythm for theological teaching or statement. The heretics propounded their peculiar doctrines in psalms. Clement of Alexandria wrote a hymn in honor of Christ for the use of catechumens, and Arius embodied his heresy in his Thalia, which was sung in the streets and taverns of Alexandria. The Muratorian Canon was probably composed in verse. In the last quarter of the fourth century, there are two metrical lists of Scripture by Amphilochius and Gregory Nazianzen.<p>Was manifest (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;)<p>More correctly, was manifested. The verb is used <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-2.htm">John 1:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-26.htm">Hebrews 9:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/1-20.htm">1 Peter 1:20</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-5.htm">1 John 3:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_john/3-8.htm">1 John 3:8</a>, of the historical manifestation of Christ; and of the future coming of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/3-4.htm">Colossians 3:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/5-4.htm">1 Peter 5:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-2.htm">1 John 3:2</a>.<p>In the flesh (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;)<p>Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-14.htm">John 1:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-2.htm">1 John 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_john/1-7.htm">2 John 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/1-3.htm">Romans 1:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-3.htm">Romans 8:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-5.htm">Romans 9:5</a>. &#x3a3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3be; flesh only here in Pastorals.<p>Justified in the Spirit (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;)<p>The verb &#x3b4;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;&#x3bd;, so familiar in Paul's writings, is found in the Pastorals only here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/3-7.htm">Titus 3:7</a>. Its application to Christ as the subject of justification does not appear in Paul. Its meaning here is vindicated, indorsed, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-19.htm">Matthew 11:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-29.htm">Luke 10:29</a>. Concerning the whole phrase it is to be said: (a) That the two clauses, manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, exhibit a contrast between two aspects of the life of Christ (b) That &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; in must have the same meaning in both clauses (c) That meaning is not instrumental, by, nor purely modal, expressing the kind and manner of Christ's justification, but rather local with a shade of modality. It expresses in each case a peculiar condition which accompanied the justification; a sphere of life in which it was exhibited and which gave character to it. In the one condition or sphere (the flesh) he was hated, persecuted, and murdered. In the other (the Spirit) he was triumphantly vindicated. See further the additional note at the end of this chapter.<p>Seen of angels (&#x3c9;&#787;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3b8;&#x3b7; &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;)<p>Better, appeared unto or showed himself to, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/17-3.htm">Matthew 17:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/1-11.htm">Luke 1:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/9-28.htm">Hebrews 9:28</a>. The same verb is used of the appearance of the risen Christ to different persons or parties (<a href="http://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-5.htm">1 Corinthians 15:5-8</a>). The reference of the words cannot be determined with certainty. They seem to imply some great, majestic occasion, rather than the angelic manifestations during Jesus' earthly life. Besides, on these occasions, the angels appeared to him, not he to them. The reference is probably to his appearance in the heavenly world after his ascension, when the glorified Christ, having been triumphantly vindicated in his messianic work and trial, presented himself to the heavenly hosts.
