A minister must give as little occasion for blame as can be, lest he bring reproach upon his office. He must be sober, temperate, moderate in all his actions, and in the use of all creature-comforts. Sobriety and watchfulness are put together in Scripture, they assist one the other. The families of ministers ought to be examples of good to all other families. We should take heed of pride; it is a sin that turned angels into devils. He must be of good repute among his neighbours, and under no reproach from his former life. To encourage all faithful ministers, we have Christ's gracious word of promise, Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world, Mt 28:20. And he will fit his ministers for their work, and carry them through difficulties with comfort, and reward their faithfulness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For if a man know not how to rule - This is a beautiful and striking argument. A church resembles a family. It is, indeed, larger, and there is a greater variety of dispositions in it than there is in a family. The authority of a minister of the gospel in a church is also less absolute than that of a father. But still there is a striking resemblance. The church is made up of an assemblage of brothers and sisters. They are banded together for the same purposes, and have a common object to aim at. They have common feelings and common needs. They have sympathy, like a family, with each other in their distresses and afflictions. The government of the church also is designed to be "paternal." It should be felt that he who presides over it has the feelings of a father; that he loves all the members of the great family; that he has no prejudices, no partialities, no selfish aims to gratify.<p>Now, if a man cannot govern his own family well; if he is severe, partial, neglectful, or tyrannical at home, how can he be expected to take charge of the more numerous "household of faith" with proper views and feelings? If, with all the natural and strong ties of affection which bind a father to his own children; if, when they are few comparatively in number, and where his eye is constantly upon them, he is unable to govern them aright, how can he be expected to preside in a proper manner over the larger household where he will be bound with comparatively feebler ties, and where he will be exposed more to the influence of passion, and where he will have a much less constant opportunity of supervision? Confucius, as quoted by Doddridge, has a sentiment strikingly resembling that before us: "It is impossible that he who knows not how to govern and reform his own family, should rightly govern and reform a people." We may remark, also, in this verse, a delicate and beautiful use of words by the apostle to prevent the possibility of misapprehension. While he institutes a comparison between the government of a family and that of the church, he guards against the possibility of its being supposed that he would countenance "arbitrary" authority in the church, even such authority as a father must of necessity employ in his own family. Hence, he uses different words. He speaks of the father as "ruling" over his own family, or "presiding over it" - &#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  proste&#772;nai; he describes the minister of religion as "having a tender care for the church" -  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bb;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;  epimele&#772;setai. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>5.

The verb <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμελέομαι</span> has not only the more general meaning of “take care of something” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-34.htm" title="And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him....">Luke 10:34-35</a>), but also more definitely, “fill an office, be overseer over something,” in which sense it is used here.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>For a right understanding of the connection of this verse with what precedes, it is to be observed that the first requisite for a successful superintendence is obedience (<span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ὙΠΟΤΑΓΉ</span></span></span>) from the church towards its superintendent. It is the bishop’s duty so to conduct himself that the members of the church may be obedient to him, not as servants to a master, but as children to a father, that they may show him obedience in love.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[120] Theodoret: <span class="greekheb">ὁ τὰ σμικρὰ οἰκονομεῖν οὐκ εἰδὼς</span>, <span class="greekheb">πῶς δύναται τῶν κρειττόνων καὶ θείων πιστευθῆναι τὴν ἐπιμέλειαν</span>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/3.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-5.htm" title="(For if a man know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take care of the church of God?)">1 Timothy 3:5</a>.

The point is resumed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-15.htm" title="But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and ground of the truth.">1 Timothy 3:15</a>. Alf. quotes a sentence from Plato in which both <span class="greekheb">προστῆναι</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμελεῖσθαι</span> are used of the government of a family; nevertheless it is not fanciful to suppose that we have here a deliberate interchange of terms, <span class="greekheb">προστῆναι</span> being, as we have seen above, almost a technical term to express Church government; while <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμελ</span>. expresses the personal care and attention of a father for his family. See the use of the verb in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/luke/10-34.htm" title="And went to him, and bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast, and brought him to an inn, and took care of him....">Luke 10:34-35</a>, and of <span class="greekheb">ἐπιμέλεια</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-3.htm" title="And the next day we touched at Sidon.

The omission of the article before <span class="greekheb">θεοῦ</span> is characteristic of the Pastorals. The phrase is found also in St. Paul’s apostolic charge to the episcopi of Ephesus in <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/20-28.htm" title="Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he has purchased with his own blood.">Acts 20:28</a>.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_timothy/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>. <span class="ital">for if a man know not</span>] <span class="bld">but</span>, the force of the adversative conjunction being, ‘You may think me needlessly particular in requiring this, but a straw will shew how the wind blows, a bad parent will make a bad pastor.’ The negative is to be taken closely with the verb ‘is ignorant.’ There is a preference, especially in later Greek, for the stronger negative where there is an antithesis or where there is special emphasis by the negativing of a single word. Cf. Winer, § 55, 2; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm" title="For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.
