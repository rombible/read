The same orderly and decorous household is required now in the case of the deacon, as was to be looked for as qualification for the presiding elder. St. Paul knew well that in the wise yet tender father, Timothy would find the firm yet generous distributor of the Church’s alms, the loving and devoted friend of the poor sick.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/3.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/3-12.htm" title="Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well....">1 Timothy 3:12-13</a></span>. <span class="ital">Let the deacons </span>— As well as the bishops; <span class="ital">be husbands of one wife </span>— That is, such as have shown their temperance by avoiding polygamy and causeless divorce; (see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>;) <span class="ital">ruling their children,</span> &c. — This qualification, which was required in bishops likewise, shows how anxious the apostle was that all who bore sacred offices should be unblameable in every respect; knowing that the disorderly behaviour of the members of their family might give occasion to suspect that they had been careless of their morals. <span class="ital">For they that have used — </span>Have discharged; <span class="ital">the office of a deacon well, </span>(see <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/romans/12-7.htm" title="Or ministry, let us wait on our ministering: or he that teaches, on teaching;...">Romans 12:7-8</a>,) <span class="ital">purchase to themselves a good de</span>gree — Greek, <span class="greekheb">βαθμον</span>, <span class="ital">step, </span>namely, toward some higher office; <span class="ital">and great boldness </span>— From the testimony of a good conscience; <span class="ital">in the faith which is in Christ Jesus </span>— Namely, in professing and teaching it, for even the wicked must respect persons who show so much benevolence and activity in relieving the poor, the afflicted, and the persecuted.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>3:8-13 The deacons were at first appointed to distribute the charity of the church, and to manage its concerns, yet pastors and evangelists were among them. The deacons had a great trust reposed in them. They must be grave, serious, prudent men. It is not fit that public trusts should be lodged in the hands of any, till they are found fit for the business with which they are to be trusted. All who are related to ministers, must take great care to walk as becomes the gospel of Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife - notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>.<p>Ruling their children and their own houses well - notes, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm">1 Timothy 3:4-5</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/3.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. husbands of one wife&#8212;(See on [2470]1Ti 3:2).<p>ruling their children&#8212;There is no article in the Greek, "ruling children"; implying that he regarded the having children to rule as a qualification (1Ti 3:4; Tit 1:6).<p>their own houses&#8212;as distinguished from "the Church of God" (see on [2471]1Ti 3:5). In the case of the deacons, as in that of the bishops, he mentions the first condition of receiving office, rather than the special qualifications for its discharge. The practical side of Christianity is the one most dwelt on in the Pastoral Epistles, in opposition to the heretical teachers; moreover, as the miraculous gifts began to be withdrawn, the safest criterion of efficiency would be the previous moral character of the candidate, the disposition and talent for the office being presupposed. So in Ac 6:3, a similar criterion was applied, "Look ye out among you seven men of honest report." Less stress is laid on personal dignity in the case of the deacon than in that of the bishop (compare Notes, see on [2472]1Ti 3:2,3).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/3.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> See the sense of these words, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>,4</span>, being the qualifications also of a bishop. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Let the deacons be the husbands of one wife,....
