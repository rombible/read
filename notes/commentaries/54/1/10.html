Among the sins which especially excite the hot wrath of the first inspired teachers of Christianity, “want of truth” appears singularly prominent. One after the other of the Apostles, in different language, express their deep abhorrence of this too common sin, which, in St. John’s fervid words, will suffice to exclude from the city of the blessed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/22-15.htm" title="For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and idolaters, and whoever loves and makes a lie.">Revelation 22:15</a>).<p><span class= "bld">And if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine.</span>—In this broad and general summary, with which St. Paul concludes his dreadful catalogue, the prohibition of the Tenth Commandment against “covetousness” is doubtless included. In the words “sound doctrine”—an expression peculiar to this group of Epistles—a sharp contrast is suggested to the “sickly and unhealthy” teaching of the false teachers, with their foolish legends and allegories—a teaching which suggested controversy and useless disputes, and had no practical influence at all upon <span class= "ital">life.</span><p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-11 Whatever tends to weaken love to God, or love to the brethren, tends to defeat the end of the commandment. The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For whoremongers - <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-29.htm">Leviticus 19:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-5.htm">Leviticus 20:5</a>.<p>For them that defile themselves with mankind - Sodomites.

It properly means one who steals another for the purpose of making him a slave - a kidnapper. This is the common way in which people are made slaves. Some, indeed, are taken in war and sold as slaves, but the mass of those who have been reduced to servitude have become slaves by being kidnapped. Children are stolen from their parents, or wives from their husbands, or husbands from their wives, or parents from their children, or whole families are stolen together. None become slaves voluntarily, and consequently the whole process of making slaves partakes of the nature of theft of the worst kind. What theft is like that of stealing a man's children, or his wife, or his father or mother? The guilt of manstealing is incurred essentially by those who purchase those who are thus stolen - as the purchaser of a stolen horse, knowing it to be so, participates in the crime. A measure of that criminality also adheres to all who own slaves, and who thus maintain the system - for it is a system known to have been originated by theft. This crime was expressly forbidden by the law of God, and was made punishable with death; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-16.htm">Exodus 21:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-7.htm">Deuteronomy 24:7</a>.<p>For liars - <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2-4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-11.htm">Leviticus 19:11</a>.<p>For perjured persons - Those who swear falsely; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-12.htm">Leviticus 19:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-3.htm">Leviticus 6:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-7.htm">Exodus 20:7</a>.<p>And if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine - To sound or correct teaching - for so the word doctrine means.

The most heinous offense against the eighth commandment. No stealing of a man's goods can equal in atrocity the stealing of a man's liberty. Slavery is not directly assailed in the New Testament; to have done so would have been to revolutionize violently the existing order of things. But Christianity teaches principles sure to undermine, and at last overthrow it, wherever Christianity has had its natural development (Mt 7:12).<p>liars &#8230; perjured&#8212;offenders against the ninth commandment.<p>if there be any other thing&#8212;answering to the tenth commandment in its widest aspect. He does not particularly specify it because his object is to bring out the grosser forms of transgression; whereas the tenth is deeply spiritual, so much so indeed, that it was by it that the sense of sin, in its subtlest form of "lust," Paul tells us (Ro 7:7), was brought home to his own conscience. Thus, Paul argues, these would-be teachers of the law, while boasting of a higher perfection through it, really bring themselves down from the Gospel elevation to the level of the grossly "lawless," for whom, not for Gospel believers, the law was designed. And in actual practice the greatest sticklers for the law as the means of moral perfection, as in this case, are those ultimately liable to fall utterly from the morality of the law. Gospel grace is the only true means of sanctification as well as of justification.<p>sound&#8212;healthy, spiritually wholesome (1Ti 6:3; 2Ti 1:13; Tit 1:13; 2:2), as opposed to sickly, morbid (as the Greek of "doting" means, 1Ti 6:4), and "canker" (2Ti 2:17).

This practice was condemned by the Flavian law among the Romans (i), and was not allowed of among the Grecians (k); the death with which such were punished was strangling, according to the Jews (l): <p>for liars; who speak what is false, against their own knowledge and conscience, and with a design to deceive; who lie against their neighbours, and act falsely and deceitfully in trade and merchandise, as well as speak that which is not true; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/6-2.htm">Leviticus 6:2</a>. <p>for perjured persons; who take a false oath on any account, and bear false witness against their neighbour.

That the ethical character of faith is emphasized, appears from the numerous expressions regarding the false teachers, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-8.htm">1 Timothy 5:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-12.htm">1 Timothy 5:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-21.htm">1 Timothy 6:21</a>. There is a tendency to objectify faith, regarding it as something believed rather than as the act of believing. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-19.htm">1 Timothy 1:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-10.htm">1 Timothy 6:10</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-21.htm">1 Timothy 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>. In comparing the ideal of righteousness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>) with that of Paul, note that it is not denied that Christ is the source of true righteousness; but according to Paul, the man who is not under the law is the man who lives by faith in Christ. Paul emphasizes this. It is faith in Christ which sets one free from the law. Here, the man for whom the law is not made (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>) is the man who is ethically conformed to the norm of sound teaching. The two conceptions do not exclude each other: the sound teaching is according to the gospel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-11.htm">1 Timothy 1:11</a>), but the point of emphasis is shifted. </body></html>
