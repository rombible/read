The Law of Moses was not, then, enacted for a “righteous man”—that is, for a Christian in the true sense of the word, who has sought and found justification by faith in Jesus, and who, sanctified by the Holy Ghost, is living a new life. In other words, the “teacher,” Paul says, must teach the flock of Ephesus (1) the true use of the <span class= "ital">prohibitions</span> of the Law, viz., that they served to convince a man of his hopeless condition; they showed him he was a slave to sin, from which wretched bondage, the Law, which made him bitterly conscious of his condition, gave him no assistance to free himself; (2) the “teacher” was to press home to the people that the Law, good though it was, if used as a means to open men’s eyes to see their true condition, was not made for <span class= "ital">them</span> if they were reckoned among the righteous—that is, if they had found acceptance in the Redeemer. In the case of these justified and sanctified ones the moral law was written in their hearts and was embodied in their lives.<p><span class= "bld">But for the lawless.</span>—Now the Law was not made for the holy and humble men of heart, whom St. Paul trusted formed the main body of the congregation of believers in Ephesus, and in every city where men and women were found who called on the name of the Lord Jesus, and who struggled to follow their dear Master’s footsteps. It was made centuries before Jesus of Nazareth walked on earth, as a great protest against the every-day vices which dishonoured Israel in common with the rest of mankind. The terrible enumeration of sins and sinners in these 9th and 10th verses, while following the order of the ancient Tables of Sinai, seems to allude pointedly to the vices especially prevalent in that day in the great centres of the Roman empire.<p><span class= "bld">And disobedient.</span>—More accurately rendered, <span class= "ital">unruly, </span>or <span class= "ital">insubordinate.</span><p><span class= "bld">For the ungodly and for sinners.</span>—These four terms with which the Apostle opens his sad list of those for whom the Law was enacted, generally denote those who care nothing for human law, and who despise all obedience; who to their careless neglect for all constituted authorities, unite irreligion and contempt for all sacred things.<p><span class= "bld">For unholy and profane.</span>—The persons designated in these terms are those wanting in inner purity—men who scoff at holiness of life and character in its deepest sense. These six classes may be assumed in general terms to include the prohibitions of the first four Commandments (the First Table, as it is termed), where sins against God are especially dwelt upon. The sins against man, which form the subject of the prohibitions of the Second Table (Commandments Five to Ten), are included in the following enumeration of wrong-doers.<p><span class= "bld">For murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers.</span>—The original Greek expressions here require the milder rendering, <span class= "ital">smiters of fathers and smiters of mothers, </span>and refer to persons of various ages who refuse all reverence, even all kindly treatment, to their parents. The words of the Fifth Commandment exactly explain this unnatural conduct.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:5-11 Whatever tends to weaken love to God, or love to the brethren, tends to defeat the end of the commandment. The design of the gospel is answered, when sinners, through repentance towards God and faith in Jesus Christ, are brought to exercise Christian love. And as believers were righteous persons in God's appointed way, the law was not against them. But unless we are made righteous by faith in Christ, really repenting and forsaking sin, we are yet under the curse of the law, even according to the gospel of the blessed God, and are unfit to share the holy happiness of heaven.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Knowing this - That is, "If anyone knows, or admits this, he has the prover view of the design of the law." The apostle does not refer particularly to himself as knowing or conceding this, for then he would have uses the plural form of the participle (see the Greek), but he means that anyone who had just views of the law would see that that which he proceeds to specify was its real purpose.<p>The law is not made for a righteous man - There has been great variety in the interpretation of this passage. Some suppose that the law here refers to the ceremonial laws of Moses (Clarke, Rosenmuller, Abbot); others to the denunciatory part of the law (Doddridge and Bloomfield); and others that it means that the chief purpose of the law was to restrain the wicked. It seems clear, however, that the apostle does not refer merely to the ceremonial law, for he specifies that which condemns the unholy and profane; the murderers of fathers and mothers; liars and perjured persons. It was not the ceremonial law which condemned these things, but the moral law. It cannot be supposed, moreover, that the apostle meant to say that the law was not binding on a righteous man, or that he was under no obligation to obey it - for he everywhere teaches that the moral law is obligatory on all mankind.<p>To suppose also that a righteous man is released from the obligation to obey the law, that is, to do right, is an absurdity. Nor does he seem to mean, as Macknight supposes, that the law was not given for the purpose of justifying a righteous man - for this was originally one of its designs. Had man always obeyed it, he would have been justified by it. The meaning seems to be, that the purpose of the law was not to fetter and perplex those who were righteous, and who aimed to do their duty and to please God. It was not intended to produce a spirit of servitude and bondage. As the Jews interpreted it, it did this, and this interpretation appears to have been adopted by the teachers at Ephesus, to whom Paul refers. The whole tendency of their teaching was to bring the soul into a state of bondage, and to make religion a condition, of servitude. Paul teaches, on the other hand, that religion was a condition of freedom, and that the main purpose of the law was not to fetter the minds of the righteous by numberless observances and minute regulations, but that it was to restrain the wicked from sin. This is the case with all law. No good man feels himself lettered and manacled by wholesome laws, nor does he feel that the purpose of law is to reduce him to a state of servitude. It is only the wicked who have this feeling - and in this sense the law is made for a man who intends to do wrong.<p>For the lawless - To bind and restrain them. The word here used means, properly, those who have no law, and then those who are transgressors - the wicked. It is rendered transgressors in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/15-28.htm">Matthew 15:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>, and wicked, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a>.<p>And disobedient - Those who are insubordinate, lawless, refractory. The word properly means those who are under no subjection or authority. It occurs in the New Testament only here, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-6.htm">Titus 1:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>, where it is rendered unruly, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/hebrews/2-8.htm">Hebrews 2:8</a>, where it is translated not put under; that is, under Christ.<p>For the ungodly - Those who have no religion; who do not worship or honor God. The Greek word occurs in the following places, in all of which it is rendered ungodly; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-5.htm">Romans 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-6.htm">Romans 5:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/4-18.htm">1 Peter 4:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/3-7.htm">2 Peter 3:7</a>; Jde 1:15. The meaning is, that the law is against all who do not worship or honor God.<p>And for sinners - The word used here is the common word to denote sinners. It is general, and includes sins of all kinds.<p>For unholy - "Those who are regardless of duty to God or man," Robinson, Lexicon. The word occurs in the New Testament only here, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a>. It has particular reference to those who fail of their duty toward God, and means those who have no piety; who are irreligious.<p>And profane - This does not necessarily mean that they were profane in the sense that blasphemed the name of God, or were profane swearers - though the word would include that - but it means properly those who are impious, or who are scoffers; notes, <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>. The word occurs only in the following places, in all of which it is rendered profane: <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-9.htm">1 Timothy 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>. A man who treats religion with contempt. mockery, or scorn, would correspond with the meaning of the word.<p>For murderers of fathers - The Greek properly means a "smiter of a father" (Robinson), though here it undoubtedly means a parricide. This was expressly forbidden by the law of Moses, and was a crime punishable by death; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>. It is said to have been a crime which the Roman law did not contemplate as possible, and hence that there was no enactment against it. It is, indeed, a crime of the highest order; but facts have shown that if the Romans supposed it would never be committed, they did not judge aright of human nature. There is no sin which man will not commit if unrestrained, and there is in fact no conceivable form of crime of which he has not been guilty.<p>Murderers of mothers - A still more atrocious and monstrous crime, if possible, than the former. We can conceive nothing superior to this in atrocity, and yet it has been committed. Nero caused his mother to be murdered, and the annals of crime disclose the names of not a few who have imbrued their own hands in the blood of those who bare them. This was also expressly forbidden by the law of Moses; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>.<p>For manslayers - This word occurs nowhere else in the New Testament. It means a homicide - a murderer. The crime is expressly forbidden by the law; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-13.htm">Exodus 20:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/1.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. law is not made for a righteous man&#8212;not for one standing by faith in the righteousness of Christ put on him for justification,and imparted inwardly by the Spirit for sanctification. "One not forensically amenable to the law" [Alford]. For sanctification, the law gives no inward power to fulfil it; but Alford goes too far in speaking of the righteous man as "not morally needing the law." Doubtless, in proportion as he is inwardly led by the Spirit, the justified man needs not the law, which is only an outward rule (Ro 6:14; Ga 5:18, 23). But as the justified man often does not give himself up wholly to the inward leading of the Spirit, he morally needs the outward law to show him his sin and God's requirements. The reason why the ten commandments have no power to condemn the Christian, is not that they have no authority over him, but because Christ has fulfilled them as our surety (Ro 10:4).<p>disobedient&#8212;Greek, "not subject"; insubordinate; it is translated "unruly," Tit 1:6, 10; "lawless and disobedient" refer to opposers of the law, for whom it is "enacted" (so the Greek, for "is made").<p>ungodly and &#8230; sinners&#8212;Greek, he who does not reverence God, and he who openly sins against Him; the opposers of God, from the law comes.<p>unholy and profane&#8212;those inwardly impure, and those deserving exclusion from the outward participation in services of the sanctuary; sinners against the third and fourth commandments.<p>murderers&#8212;or, as the Greek may mean, "smiters" of fathers and &#8230; mothers; sinners against the fifth commandment.<p>manslayers&#8212;sinners against the sixth commandment.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> By <span class="bld">the law</span> is to be understood the moral law, (though possibly not excluding the law of Moses, consisting in many ordinances), as it is armed with stings and terrors, to restrain rebellious sinners; by the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">righteous man, </span> one in whom a principle of Divine grace is planted, and, from the knowledge and love of God, chooses the things that are pleasing to him, and is ardent and active to do his will. Now it is true, the holiness commanded in the law, that, consists in the love of God and our neighhour, obliges every reasonable creature indispensably and eternally; but as the law was delivered in so terrible a manner, as it has annexed so many severe threatenings to the transgressors of it, it is evident that it is directed to the wicked, who will only be compelled by fear from an outrageous breaking of it. And this may be emphatically signified in the word here used, keitai, for it signifies to be laid, as well as to be made. The law <span class="ital">non objicitur</span> is not lald against a righteous man. Thus we translate it, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/3-10.htm" title="And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees: therefore every tree which brings not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire.">Matthew 3:10</a></span>: <span class="ital">The axe is laid unto the root of the trees:</span> there is some difference in the construction; here it is immediately joined with the dative case, there with an accusative case, with the preposition prov between the verb and the case; but that must be the sense. It is very probable, that these false teachers had been terrifying the Christians with the law, in opposition to whom the apostle saith, the law was not made for a righteous man, as to its condemning office; it was never intended against a righteous man, but against men that committed and lived in gross sin and wickedness. These sinners are first mentioned in general terms, then the apostle proceedeth to a more particular enumeration of them; whether in them (as some think) the apostle hath respect to the several precepts of the decalogue, I cannot determine. By <span class="ital">the lawless</span> he meaneth persons living without any respect to the laws of God or men. By the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">disobedient</span> he meaneth such as will live in subjection to no government. The word by us translated <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">ungodly, </span> signifieth such as live without any religion, having no regard to the worship of God, asebesi. The word translated <span class="ital">sinners</span> signifies infamous, scandalous sinners. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Unholy and profane</span> are also general terms, signifying persons that have no piety, but lewdly talk of things sacred, and live as lewdly. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers:</span> the words signify such as strike or beat their parents, though they do not give them mortal wounds, and well expresseth violaters of the fifth commandment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Manslayers, </span> androfonouv, signifies such as kill men, whether maliciously or passionately, violaters of the sixth commandment. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man,.... No man is naturally righteous since Adam, excepting the man Christ Jesus: some that are righteous in their own opinion, and in the esteem of others, are not truly and really so; none are righteous, or can be justified in the sight of God by the works of the law; those only are righteous men, who are made so through the imputation of Christ's righteousness to them: and such a righteous man is here intended, who believes in Christ with the heart unto righteousness, who lays hold on Christ's righteousness, and receives it by faith; in consequence of which he lives soberly, righteously, and godly, though not without sin, since there is no such just man upon earth. Now for such a man the law was not made; which must be understood not of its original constitution and make, for it was certainly made for, and given to Adam, who was a righteous man, and was written upon his heart in a state of innocence; and who had a positive law made also for him, and given to him as a trial of his obedience to this: it was also delivered to the Israelites on Mount Sinai, who were, many of them, at least, righteous men; and besides all this, the law was made for Jesus Christ; he was the end, the mark, and scope at which it aimed, and for whose sake it was given to Israel, that he might be made under it, and fulfil it. Nor does this expression deny all use of the law to a righteous man, which has been pointed out on the preceding verse, but only removes an unlawful use, and a wrong end of the law: it never was made with any such view as to obtain righteousness by it; for, a righteous man, as Adam, in innocence, and all that are justified by Christ's righteousness, need it not for such a purpose, because they are already righteous; and sinners can never attain to righteousness by it, since it cannot give life unto them: it is made therefore not for the former with the view now mentioned, but for the latter, and that both for the restraining of sin, and punishing of sinners. The words   , may be rendered, "the law does not lie upon a righteous man", or against him. It does not lie as a weight or burden on him; its precept does not lie on him, as a task to be performed; nor does its penalty, the curse, lie on him as a punishment to be bore by him: it does not lie upon him, nor against him, as an accusing law, its mouth is stopped by the righteousness of Christ, by which he is denominated a righteous man; nor as a terrifying law, and bringing into bondage by its threats and menaces; nor as a rigorous law, obliging to obedience in a forcible and compulsive way; seeing there is no need of it, the righteous man delights in it, and cheerfully serves it, and the love of Christ constrains him to obey it freely. And much less does it lie on him, or against him as a cursing or condemning law, since Christ has redeemed him from the curse of it, <p>But for the lawless and disobedient; by the "lawless" are meant, not the Gentiles, which were without the written law, but such who have it, and despise and reject it, and live not according to it, but transgress it: and "the disobedient" design such who are not subject to it: who are sons of Belial, children without the yoke; who cast the law of the Lord behind their backs; who are not, nor can they be subject to it, without the powerful and efficacious grace of God. Now the law lies upon, and against such persons, as an accusing, terrifying, cursing, and condemning law, <p>For the ungodly, and for sinners; by the "ungodly" are intended, such as are without God in the world, who neither fear God, nor regard man, who neglect and despise the worship of God, and say to him, depart from us, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/21-14.htm">Job 21:14</a> and by "sinners" are designed notorious ones, who are exceeding great sinners, always sinning, making sin their constant business and employment; on and against these the law lies: <p>for unholy and profane: such are unholy persons, who are destitute of inward principles of truth and holiness, and who live unholy lives and conversations; and "profane" persons are those who profane the name of the Lord by cursing and swearing, and who profane his day, doctrines, and ordinances, and live dissolute and profane lives, being abandoned to all sin and wickedness; these three couples of wicked men, expressed in general terms, seem to have respect greatly to the moral part of the four precepts of the decalogue, as the following particulars do to the other six: <p>for murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers; though there is no law that expressly mentions this, yet is beyond all doubt a breach both of the fifth and sixth commands; and if cursing parents, and disobedience to them, were punishable by the law with death, then much more the murder of them; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a> though the words will bear to be rendered, "for strikers of fathers, and strikers of mothers"; and so the Syriac and Arabic versions render them, and against this there was an express law, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>. According to the Pompeian law, one guilty of parricide was to be sewed up in a sack with a dog, a cock, a viper, and an ape, and cast into the sea, or into a river (h): <p>for manslayers, guilty of the murder of any man, which was always punishable with death, and was a breach of the sixth command; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/9-6.htm">Genesis 9:6</a>. <p>(h) Pompon.

It is unnecessary to suppose that St. Paul had his theory of justification in his mind when writing this; though of course those who “are led by the Spirit” are <span class="greekheb">δίκαιοι</span> of the highest quality, <span class="greekheb">κατὰ τῶν τοιούτων οὐκ ἔστιν νόμος</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-18.htm" title="But if you be led of the Spirit, you are not under the law.">Galatians 5:18</a> <span class="ital">sqq.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/galatians/5-23.htm" title="Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.">Galatians 5:23</a>).

As the series advances, the adjectives indicate more definite and restricted aspects of lawlessness: the first three pairs represent states of mind; then follow examples of violations of specific enactments.

The <span class="greekheb">ἀσεβής</span> is one whose mental attitude towards God Himself is that of deliberate irreverence; the <span class="greekheb">βέβηλος</span> acts contumeliously towards recognised expressions or forms of reverence to God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Alford and Ellicott, following a hint from Bengel, suppose that in the series commencing <span class="greekheb">πατρολῴαις</span> St. Paul is going through the second table of the Decalogue. It is an argument against this that when St, Paul is unquestionably enumerating the Commandments, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-9.htm" title="For this, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, You shall not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.">Romans 13:9</a>, he places the command against adultery before that against murder (so <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/18-20.htm" title="You know the commandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not kill, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Honor your father and your mother.">Luke 18:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/2-11.htm" title="For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill.

There is therefore no necessity to give <span class="greekheb">πατρολῴας</span> the weak rendering <span class="ital">smiter of a father</span> (R.V. m.) in order to make the word refer to normal breaches of the Fifth Commandment, It can, of course, both by derivation and use, be so rendered, The Greek word, like <span class="ital">parricide</span> in Latin and English, may be applied to any unnatural treatment of a parent.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[256] Codex Vaticanus (sæc. iv.), published in photographic facsimile in 1889 under the care of the Abbate Cozza-Luzi.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apostle is here purposely specifying the most extreme violations of law, as samples (<span class="greekheb">καὶ εἴ τι ἕτερον</span>) of what disregard of law may lead to. The healthy, wholesome teaching of Christ is of course in opposition to such enormities; it is also in opposition to the false teachers; these teachers have failed to attain to a pure heart, etc. Consequently, although professing to teach the Law, they find themselves in opposition to the essential spirit of law.

That <span class="greek">&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span> here means the Law of Moses is further evident from this, that in the following list the apostle clearly follows the general order of the Decalogue, taking first the offences against the first table, and then sins against the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth commandments (compare, too, ver. 11 with <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-16.htm">Romans 2:16</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Lawless</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x1f79;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); with no special reference to its etymology, but meaning simply "transgressors," "wicked," as <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/22-37.htm">Luke 22:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/2-23.htm">Acts 2:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-8.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a> (A.V.), and very frequently in the LXX. <span class="cmt_word">Unruly</span> (<span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;&#x3ba;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>); insubordinate, resisting lawful authority.

The express application of the word in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-10.htm">Titus 1:10</a>, to the "unruly talkers of the circumcision," shows that St. Paul has them in view here also. <span class="cmt_word">Ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane.</span> All terms implying offences against the first table. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;</span>, (with the kindred <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f73;&#x3c9;</span>) is always rendered "ungodly," "ungodliness," "to act ungodly;" <span class="greek">&#x1f01;&#x3bc;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1fd6;&#x3c2;</span>, sinners, viz. against God; <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x1f77;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, unholy (found only here and at <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-2.htm">2 Timothy 3:2</a> in the New Testament, but frequent in the LXX.) is the contrary to <span class="greek">&#x1f45;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>, holy, saintly; <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x1f75;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> (whence <span class="greek">&#x3b2;&#x3b5;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3bb;&#x1f79;&#x3c9;</span>, to profane, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/12-5.htm">Matthew 12:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/24-6.htm">Acts 24:6</a>), profane, of persons and things not consecrated to God - peculiar in the New Testament to the pastoral Epistles (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-20.htm">1 Timothy 6:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm">2 Timothy 2:16</a>;) and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/12-16.htm">Hebrews 12:16</a>, but found commonly in the LXX. and in classical Greek. <span class="greek">&#x3a0;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff6;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3bb;&#x1ff4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, not <span class="cmt_word">murderers</span>, but, as in the margin, "<span class="accented">smiters</span>, <span class="accented">ill-users</span> of father and mother." Both words are only found here in the New Testament, but found in Demosthenes, Aristophanes, etc. The allusion here is to <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/21-15.htm">Exodus 21:15</a>, where the Hebrew word for "smiteth" is XXX, which does not necessarily mean "to smite to death" any more than <span class="greek">&#x1f00;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x1f71;&#x3c9;</span> does. <span class="greek">&#x1f08;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c6;&#x1f79;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span>, man-slayers; found only here in the New Testament, but used in 2 Macc. 9:28 and in classical writers.
