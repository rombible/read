No fleshly relationship existed between the two, but a closer and far dearer connection. St. Paul had taken him while yet a very young man to be his companion and fellow-labourer (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-3.htm" title="Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews which were in those quarters: for they knew all that his father was a Greek.">Acts 16:3</a>). He told the Philippian Church he had no one like-minded (with Timothy) who would care for their affairs. He wrote to the Corinthians how Timothy was his beloved and faithful son in the Lord, who would put them in remembrance of his ways in Christ.<p><span class= "bld">Mercy.</span>—Between the usual salutation “grace and peace,” in these Pastoral Epistles, he introduces “mercy.” The nearness of death, the weakness of old age, the dangers, ever increasing, which crowded round Paul, seem to have called forth from him deeper expressions of love and tender pity. Jesus Christ, his “hope,” burned before him, a guiding star her brighter and clearer; and the “mercy” of God, which the old man felt he had obtained, he longed to share with others.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>1:1-4 Jesus Christ is a Christian's hope; all our hopes of eternal life are built upon him; and Christ is in us the hope of glory. The apostle seems to have been the means of Timothy's conversion; who served with him in his ministry, as a dutiful son with a loving father. That which raises questions, is not for edifying; that which gives occasion for doubtful disputes, pulls down the church rather than builds it up. Godliness of heart and life can only be kept up and increased, by the exercise of faith in the truths and promises of God, through Jesus Christ.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/1.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Unto Timothy - For an account of Timothy, see Intro.

Paul had no children of his own, and he adopted Timothy as a son, and uniformly regarded and treated him as such.

See [2460]Introduction.<p>mercy&#8212;added here, in addressing Timothy, to the ordinary salutation, "Grace unto you (Ro 1:7; 1Co 1:3, &c.), and peace." In Ga 6:16, "peace and mercy" occur. There are many similarities of style between the Epistle to the Galatians and the Pastoral Epistles (see [2461]Introduction); perhaps owing to his there, as here, having, as a leading object in writing, the correction of false teachers, especially as to the right and wrong use of the law (1Ti 1:9). If the earlier date be assigned to First Timothy, it will fall not long after, or before (according as the Epistle to the Galatians was written at Ephesus or at Corinth) the writing of the Epistle to the Galatians, which also would account for some similarity of style. "Mercy" is grace of a more tender kind, exercised towards the miserable, the experience of which in one's own case especially fits for the Gospel MINISTRY. Compare as to Paul himself (1Ti 1:14, 16; 1Co 7:25; 2Co 4:1; Heb 2:17) [Bengel]. He did not use "mercy" as to the churches, because "mercy" in all its fulness already existed towards them; but in the case of an individual minister, fresh measures of it were continually needed. "Grace" has reference to the sins of men; "mercy" to their misery. God extends His grace to men as they are guilty; His "mercy" to them as they are miserable [Trench].<p>Jesus Christ&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read the order, "Christ Jesus." In the Pastoral Epistles "Christ" is often put before "Jesus," to give prominence to the fact that the Messianic promises of the Old Testament, well known to Timothy (2Ti 3:15), were fulfilled in Jesus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/1.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> He dignifies Timothy with the title of his <span class="bld">Song of Solomon in the faith; </span> that is, being converted by him to Christianity, and begat to the Divine life: and by styling Timothy his <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">own son, </span> he signifies his piety and virtue, that rendered him a worthy son of such a father, whom he imitated and honoured, and with whom he corresponded in a grateful, obedient affection. Having thus designated the person to whom he writes, he expresses his ardent desires of his complete felicity; which is included in <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">grace, mercy, and peace.</span> By <span class="ital">grace</span> he means the free favour and good will of God, with all the spiritual gifts that proceed from it, either requisite for salvation, or the great work of the evangelical ministry. By <span class="bld">mercy, </span> his compassionate tender love, pardoning, relieving, supporting, and assisting us in our Christian course. By <span class="bld">peace</span> he signifies, principally, the peace of God, that divine calm of conscience, that tranquillity and rest of soul, which proceeds from the assurance that God is reconciled to us in Christ, and our freedom by the sanctifying Spirit from the tyranny of carnal lusts: this peace can never be to the wicked. And besides this principal peace, we may understand peace with man, that is, a quiet state, exempt from hatred and persecutions, that Timothy might more comfortably and successfully perform the work of his ministry. He prays for these blessings <span class="bld">from God, </span> who is the original Fountain of all good: and from <span class="bld">Jesus Christ</span> as the channel, by which all the gifts of God are conveyed to us; for without his mediation the Deity is as a sealed fountain, no grace would flow to us. He styles God <span class="bld">our Father, </span> because he has adopted us in his Son, and in that quality he communicates his <span class="ital">grace, mercy, and peace</span> to us: he styles Christ <span class="bld">our Lord, </span> who hath supreme power over us, as well by the right of creation as of redemption. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/1.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Unto Timothy my own son in the faith,.... Not in the flesh, or by natural descent, but in a spiritual sense, in the faith of Christ; for Timothy was not related to the apostle according to the flesh, as some have thought, but the relation was spiritual; though the apostle was not properly his spiritual father, or the instrument of his conversion; for Timothy was a converted person, and a disciple of Christ, and well reported of by the brethren, when the apostle first met with him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/16-1.htm">Acts 16:1</a> but he calls him his son, either because of his age, being a young man; or because of his affection for him, so the Vulgate Latin version reads, "a beloved son"; or rather, because he was instructed more largely by the apostle into the doctrine of faith; and as a son, with a father, served with him in the Gospel of Christ. It may be rendered "a true or genuine son in the faith", in distinction from nominal Christians, formal professors and hypocrites. Timothy was a real Christian, a true believer, and an hearty and upright professor and preacher of the faith of Christ, as well as truly regenerated by the Spirit of God, <p>Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father, and Jesus Christ our Lord; the Arabic version reads, "and Lord Jesus Christ our Lord". The form of salutation is the same as in all the epistles of the apostle, only that "mercy" is here inserted; and when he wishes "grace" to Timothy, he may mean a fresh discovery of the love and free favour of God unto him, and an increase of grace in him, and of the gifts of the Spirit upon him; and by "mercy" he may intend a fresh application of the pardoning mercy of God, through Christ, and all assistance, and success in his work as a minister, and all succour and support under every trial and exercise, and mercy at the last day, or the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life; and by "peace" he may design peace of conscience through the blood of Christ, and all prosperity, temporal, spiritual, and eternal. And all this being wished for equally from Christ, as from God the Father, is a proof of the proper deity of our Lord. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/1.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Unto Timothy, <i>my</i> own son in the faith: Grace, <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> mercy, <i>and</i> peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.</span><p>(a) There is as much difference between mercy and grace, as is between the effect and the cause: for grace is that free good will of God, by which he chose us in Christ, and mercy is that free justification which follows it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/1.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-2.htm" title="To Timothy, my own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.">1 Timothy 1:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">γνησίῳ</span> qualifies the compound <span class="greekheb">τέκνῳ ἐν πίστει</span>, just as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm" title="To Titus, my own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.">Titus 1:4</a> it qualifies <span class="greekheb">τέκνῳ κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν</span>.

This is best expressed as in the A.V. by "in the faith" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a>, where the same idea is expressed by <span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x1f70;&#x20;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x1f74;&#x3bd;&#x20;&#x3c0;&#x1f77;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;</span>). <span class="cmt_word">Grace, mercy, and peace.</span> This varies from the blessing at the beginning of the Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Thessalonians, by the addition of the word "mercy," as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-2.htm">2 Timothy 1:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-4.htm">Titus 1:4</a> in the T.R., and also in 2 John 3 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jude/1-2.htm">Jude 1:2</a>. It seems in St. Paul to connect itself with that deeper sense of the need and of the enjoyment of mercy which went with his deepening sense of sin as he drew towards his end, and harmonizes beautifully with what he says in vers. 12-16. The analogy of the other forms of blessing quoted above strongly favors the sense <span class="cmt_word">our Father</span> rather than <span class="accented">the Father</span>. Whether we read <span class="greek">&#x1f21;&#x3bc;&#x1ff6;&#x3bd;</span> with the T.R. or omit it with the R.T., the idea of <span class="accented">Father</span> is contrasted, not with that of <span class="accented">Son</span>, but with that of <span class="accented">Lord</span>; the two words express the relation of the Persons of the Godhead, not to each other, but to the Church. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/1.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>My own son in the faith (&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#837; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;)<p>More correctly, "my true child in faith."
