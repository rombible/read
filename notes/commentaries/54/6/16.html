(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>, where the Eternal is addressed as covering himself with <span class= "ital">light</span> as with a garment; see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-22.htm" title="He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.">Daniel 2:22</a>, where light is spoken of as dwelling with God.) The symbolism of the old covenant teaches the same truth, the unapproachable glories in which God dwells; for instance, the guarding of the bounds of Sinai in the giving of the Law; the covering of the faces of the Seraphim in the year that King Uzziah died, when Isaiah saw the divine vision; the veiled darkness of the Holy of holies in the Tabernacle and the Temple, where ever and anon the visible glory dwelt.<p><span class= "bld">Whom no man hath seen, nor can see.</span>—The Old Testament teaches the same mysterious truth—“For there shall no man see me, and live” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/33-20.htm" title="And he said, You can not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live.">Exodus 33:20</a>, and also <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-12.htm" title="And the LORD spoke to you out of the middle of the fire: you heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only you heard a voice.">Deuteronomy 4:12</a>). <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time, the only begotten Son, which is in the bosom of the Father, he has declared him.">John 1:18</a> repeats this in very plain words—“No man hath seen God at any time.” The Greek word here includes all created beings. The English translation, “no man,” utterly fails to reproduce the meaning of the original. (See also <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/4-12.htm" title="No man has seen God at any time. If we love one another, God dwells in us, and his love is perfected in us.">1John 4:12</a>.)<p>These last words seem to preclude the interpretation which applies the foregoing description to the Son. We have above referred this glorious doxology to the Father, as the one who, in His own times, should reveal the Lord Jesus returning to judgment.<p>It is, however, very noteworthy that the loftiest, the sublimest, epithets the inspired pen of Paul could frame to dignify his description of the First Person of the ever-blessed Trinity, God the Father, are used again of the Son. “The Lamb shall overcome them: for he is <span class= "ital">Lord of lords, and King of kings”</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/17-14.htm" title="These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.">Revelation 17:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/19-16.htm" title="And he has on his clothing and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.">Revelation 19:16</a>; and see too <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-5.htm" title="And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the earth.

There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Who only hath immortality - The word here - &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3b8;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;  athanasia - properly means "exemption from death," and seems to mean that God, in his own nature, enjoys a perfect and certain exemption from death. Creatures have immortality only as they derive it from him, and of course are dependent on him for it. He has it by his very nature, and it is in his case underived, and he cannot be deprived of it. It is one of the essential attributes of his being, that he will always exist, and that death cannot reach him; compare the expression in <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm">John 5:26</a>, "The Father hath life in himself," and the notes on that passage.<p>Dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto - Greek, "Inhabiting inapproachable light." The light where he dwells is so brilliant and dazzling that mortal eyes could not endure it. This is a very common representation of the dwelling place of God. See examples quoted in Pricaeus, in loc. Heaven is constantly represented as a place of the most pure and brilliant light, needing not the light of the sun, or the moon, or the stars <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/21-23.htm">Revelation 21:23-24</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/22-5.htm">Revelation 22:5</a>, and God is represented as dwelling in that light, surrounded by amazing and inapproachable glory compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/4-6.htm">Revelation 4:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hebrews/1-3.htm">Hebrews 1:3</a>.<p>Whom no man hath seen nor can see - notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/1-18.htm">John 1:18</a>.<p>To whom be honour and power everlasting.

Who only hath immortality&#8212;in His own essence, not merely at the will of another, as all other immortal beings [Justin Martyr, Qu&aelig;st. ad Orthod., 61]. As He hath immortality, so will He give it to us who believe; to be out of Him is death. It is mere heathen philosophy that attributes to the soul indestructibility in itself, which is to be attributed solely to God's gift. As He hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself (Joh 5:26). The term used in the New Testament for "immortal," which does not occur, is "incorruptible." "Immortality" is found in 1Co 15:53, 54.<p>dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto&#8212;After life comes mention of light, as in Joh 1:4. That light is unapproachable to creatures, except in so far as they are admitted by Him, and as He goes forth to them [Bengel]. It is unapproachable on account of its exceeding brightness [Theophylact]. If one cannot gaze steadfastly at the sun, which is but a small part of creation, by reason of its exceeding heat and power, how much less can mortal man gaze at the inexpressible glory of God [Theophylact, To Autolycus] (Ps 104:2; 1Jo 1:5).<p>no man hath seen&#8212;(Ex 23:20; Joh 1:18; Col 1:15; Heb 11:27; 1Jo 4:12). Perhaps even in the perfect state no creature shall fully see God. Still the saints shall, in some sense, have the blessedness of seeing Him, which is denied to mere man (Mt 5:8; 1Co 13:12; 1Jo 3:2; Re 22:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Who only hath immortality; </span> of himself; our souls and angels are immortal from the gift of God: or <span class="ital">immortality</span> signifies here the same with eternity, or immutability. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Dwelling in the light; </span> continually encompassed with a glory that is unspeakable, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/1-5.htm" title="This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.">1Jo 1:5</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Which no man can approach unto; </span> to which no man can in this life come nigh. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Whom no man hath seen; </span> nor did Moses, or Stephen, or any other, ever see his glory so as to comprehend it, or in the full perfection of it. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Nor can see; </span> nor can the sons of men see him with their bodily eyes, or so as to comprehend him in his perfection, though some have with their bodily eyes seen his back parts and appearances, and with their souls have, through his grace, been enabled spiritually to behold him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To whom be honour and power everlasting.

Angels are immortal, and so are the souls of men, and so will be the bodies of men after the resurrection; but then neither of these have immortality of themselves, they have it from God; who only has it, of himself, originally, essentially, and inderivatively. <p>Dwelling in that light which no man can approach unto; in this present, frail, and mortal state; yea, angels themselves cannot bear the lustre of it, but cover their faces with their wings; for God is light itself, as well as clothes himself with light, as with a garment; and is the Father and fountain of lights to all his creatures. <p>Whom no man hath seen, nor can see: nowhere but in Christ, at least spiritually and savingly; and that but very imperfectly in the present state: the sin, frailty, and mortality of human nature must be taken away, in order to inherit the kingdom of God, and enjoy the beatific vision of him; which saints in heaven have, who see him as he is, and in such sort as no man now does, or can see him: <p>to whom be honour and power everlasting, Amen. Which may be considered either as a wish, that such honour, power, and glory might be ascribed unto him, as we supply it; or as an assertion that it is given to him, as it is by the angels, and by the saints in heaven and in earth. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Who only hath immortality, dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto; whom no man hath seen, nor can see: to whom be honour and power everlasting.

God the Son and God the Holy Spirit are co-eternal with the Father; but Their life is derived from and dependent on His. This is expressly declared by Christ of Himself, “As the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/john/5-26.htm" title="For as the Father has life in himself; so has he given to the Son to have life in himself;">John 5:26</a>). On this Westcott notes: “The Son has not life only as given, but life <span class="ital">in Himself</span> as being a spring of life.… The tense (<span class="ital">gave</span>) carries us back beyond time”. Accordingly, the creed of Cæsarea, which formed the basis of that adopted at Nicea, spoke of the Son as <span class="greekheb">Ζωὴν ἐκ Ζωὴς</span>; a doctrine sufficiently expressed in the other phrase, <span class="greekheb">φῶς ἐκ φωτός</span>, which has survived.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">φῶς οἰκῶν ἀπρόσιτον</span>: This is a grander conception than that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-2.htm" title="Who cover yourself with light as with a garment: who stretch out the heavens like a curtain:">Psalm 104:2</a>, “Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment”. Here, if one may venture so to express it, the Person of God is wholly concealed by His dwelling, which is light; and this dwelling is itself unapproachable.
