Every earthly possession is only meant for this life—for the period between the hour of birth and the hour of death; we entered this world with nothing, we shall leave the world again with nothing. If we could take anything with us when death parts soul and body there would at once be an end to the “contentment” (of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-6.htm" title="But godliness with contentment is great gain.">1Timothy 6:6</a>), for the future then would in some way be dependent on the present. This sentence is quoted by Polycarp, in his letter to the Philippians, written early in the second century. Such a reference shows that this Epistle was known and treasured in the Christian Church even at that early date.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:6-10 Those that make a trade of Christianity to serve their turn for this world, will be disappointed; but those who mind it as their calling, will find it has the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come. He that is godly, is sure to be happy in another world; and if contented with his condition in this world, he has enough; and all truly godly people are content. When brought into the greatest straits, we cannot be poorer than when we came into this world; a shroud, a coffin, and a grave, are all that the richest man in the world can have from all his wealth. If nature should be content with a little, grace should be content with less. The necessaries of life bound a true Christian's desires, and with these he will endeavour to be content. We see here the evil of covetousness. It is not said, they that are rich, but they will be rich; who place their happiness in wealth, and are eager and determined in the pursuit. Those that are such, give to Satan the opportunity of tempting them, leading them to use dishonest means, and other bad practices, to add to their gains. Also, leading into so many employments, and such a hurry of business, as leave no time or inclination for spiritual religion; leading to connexions that draw into sin and folly. What sins will not men be drawn into by the love of money! People may have money, and yet not love it; but if they love it, this will push them on to all evil. Every sort of wickedness and vice, in one way or another, grows from the love of money. We cannot look around without perceiving many proofs of this, especially in a day of outward prosperity, great expenses, and loose profession.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For we brought nothing into this world ... - A sentiment very similar to this occurs in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a> - and it would seem probable that the apostle had that passage in his eye; see the notes on that passage. Numerous expressions of this kind occur in the classic writers; see Wetstein, in loc., and Pricaeus, in loc. in the Critici Sacri. Of the truth of what is here said, there can be nothing more obvious. It is apparent to all. We bring no property with us into the world - no clothing, no jewels, no gold - and it is equally clear that we can take nothing with us when we leave the earth. Our coming into the world introduces no additional property to that which the race before possessed, and our going from the world removes none that we may have helped the race to accumulate. This is said by the apostle as an obvious reason why we should be contented if our actual needs are supplied - for this is really all that we need, and all that the world is toiling for.<p>We can carry nothing out - compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-17.htm">Psalm 49:17</a>.

Therefore, we should have no gain-seeking anxiety, the breeder of discontent (Mt 6:25).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> This agreeth with <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a></span>, and with experience, and is a potent argument against immoderate desires of having much of this world’s goods, or using extravagant actions to obtain them; for when we have got all we can, we have got but a <span class="ital">viaticum, </span> something to serve us in our journey, which we must leave when we die, and whether to a wise man or a fool none knoweth, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/2-19.htm" title="And who knows whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet shall he have rule over all my labor wherein I have labored, and wherein I have showed myself wise under the sun.

Which is a reason both clearly showing that godliness is great gain, since those who have it brought nothing into the world with them but sin, and yet are now in such happy circumstances as before described; and that godly persons should be content with what they have, even of worldly things, seeing they are so much more than they had when they came into the world, into which they came naked; and which should be a quieting consideration under the most stripping providences; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm">Job 1:21</a><p>and it is certain we can carry nothing out: as men come into the world, so will they go out of it; nor will they need their worldly substance after death, any more than they did before they were born; and what they now have, and use not, will then be lost to them, whatever gain it may be to others: wherefore it becomes them cheerfully to use what they have, and be content therewith; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>.

The apostle here places two clauses together, each of which contains a well-known and undoubted truth: “<span class="ital">We brought nothing into the world</span>,” and “<span class="ital">We can take nothing out of it</span>.” (The same two thoughts are found elsewhere in collocation; so <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-14.htm" title="But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begets a son, and there is nothing in his hand.">Ecclesiastes 5:14</a>; also in the profane writers, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Seneca, <span class="ital">Ep.</span> 102: non licet plus efferre, quam intuleris. For the second thought, comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-19.htm" title="The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he opens his eyes, and he is not.">Job 27:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-12.htm" title="Nevertheless man being in honor stays not: he is like the beasts that perish.">Psalm 49:12</a>.) The question is only, in what relation do they stand to one another? According to the common view, the first thought serves to confirm the second: “As we brought nothing in, it is manifest that we will take nothing out.” Against this, Hofmann maintains that the second thought is in no way a consequence of the first. He therefore takes <span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι</span> as an adverbial: “clearly,” standing at the end of the sentence, but belonging to both clauses; and he explains: “Clearly we have brought nothing in, and can also take nothing out.” He is certainly right that the first does not strictly prove the second; but then the apostle did not intend that it should; he simply placed the two sentences together, the second corresponding to the first in such a way as to be confirmed by it in popular opinion. Hence it is not right to connect—contrary to the order of the words<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι</span> with the first sentence. As to the lack of <span class="greekheb">δῆλον</span> before <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> (see the critical remarks), de Wette observes: “that in popular logic the consequence is often quoted with <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> as the reason, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> Homer, <span class="ital">Il.</span> xvi. 35, <span class="ital">Od.</span> xxii. 36.” This, however, is not to the point here; in the two passages quoted, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>, simply denotes the logical ground of knowledge.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-7.htm" title="For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.">1 Timothy 6:7</a>. The reasoning of this clause depends on the evident truth that since a man comes naked into this world (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-21.htm" title="And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD.">Job 1:21</a>), and when he leaves it can “take nothing for his labour, which he may carry away in his hand” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/5-15.htm" title="As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labor, which he may carry away in his hand.">Ecclesiastes 5:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/49-17.htm" title="For when he dies he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall not descend after him.">Psalm 49:17</a>), nothing the world can give is any addition to the man himself. He is a complete man, though naked (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/6-25.htm" title="Therefore I say to you, Take no thought for your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor yet for your body, what you shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?">Matthew 6:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-15.htm" title="And he said to them, Take heed, and beware of covetousness: for a man's life consists not in the abundance of the things which he possesses.">Luke 12:15</a>; Seneca, <span class="ital">Ep. Mor</span>. lii. 25, “Non licet plus efferre quam intuleris”).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Field is right in supposing that if <span class="greekheb">δῆλον</span>, as read in the Received Text, is spurious, yet “there is an ellipsis of <span class="greekheb">δῆλον</span>, or that <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is for <span class="greekheb">δῆλον ὅτι</span>. L. Bos adduces but one example of this ellipsis, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_john/3-20.htm" title="For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things.">1 John 3:20</a> : <span class="greekheb">ὅτι ἐὰν καταγινώσκῃ ἡμῶν ἡ καρδία</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὅτι μείζων ἐστὶν ὁ θεὸς τῆς καρδίας ἡμῶν</span>; in which, if an ellipsis of <span class="greekheb">δῆλον</span> before the second <span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span>. were admissible, it would seem to offer an easy explanation of that difficult text.” Field adds two examples from St. Chrysostom. Hort’s conjecture that “<span class="greekheb">ὅτι</span> is no more than an accidental repetition of the last two letters of <span class="greekheb">κόσμον</span>, <span class="greekheb">ΟΝ</span> being read as <span class="greekheb">ΟΤΙ</span>” is almost certainly right.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/1_timothy/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">7</span>. <span class="ital">we brought nothing into</span> this <span class="ital">world</span>] A further reason for contentment is drawn; ‘the nakedness of our birth and death.’ Exactly, <span class="bld">into the world</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>and it is <span class="ital">certain</span>] Editors are divided as to the authority for this word here: the Revisers and Westcott and Hort omit. Inclining to this view with Codex Sinaiticus, and on the ground that <span class="ital">proclivi praestat ardua lectio</span>, we have to render the connecting particle that remains ‘because;’ but need not adopt Alford’s strained explanation ‘we were appointed by God to come naked into the world, to teach us to remember that we must go naked out of it,’ which mars the simple sequence of thought (we should look rather to the looser usage of such particles already beginning to prevail): ‘because’ may be referred back to the contentment, and so introduce a parallel not a subordinate clause to ‘we brought,’ <span class="bld">because too we cannot carry anything out</span>.
