The writers and actors in the New Testament history we have so long surrounded with a halo of reverence, that we are tempted often to forget that they were but men exposed to temptations like us, and not unfrequently succumbing to them. We owe them, indeed, a deep debt of reverence for their faithful, gallant witness—for their splendid service in laying so well the early storeys of the great Christian Temple; but we lose somewhat of the reality of the Apostolic story when in the saint we forget the man. After the very solemn, the intensely earnest warning against covetousness—that fatal love of gain and gold which seems to have been the mainspring of the life of those false teachers who were engaged in marring the noble work St. Paul had done for his Master at Ephesus—after these weighty words, the fact of St. Paul turning to Timothy, and, with the grand old covenant title Timothy knew so well, personally addressing his loved friend with “But thou, O man of God, flee these things,” leads us irresistibly to the conclusion that the old Apostle was dreading for his young and comparatively untried disciple the corrupting danger of the wealth of the city in which he held so great a charge; so he warns Timothy, and, through Timothy, God’s servants of all grades and powers in different ages, of the soul-destroying dangers of covetousness—“Flee these things.” A glance at Timothy’s present life will show how possible it was, even for a loved pupil of St. Paul—even for one of whom he once wrote, “I have no man likeminded;” and, again, “Ye know the proof of him, that, as a son with the father, he hath served with me in the gospel” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/philippians/2-20.htm" title="For I have no man like minded, who will naturally care for your state.">Philippians 2:20-22</a>)—to need so grave a reminder. Since those days, when these words were written to the Philippians, some six years had passed. His was no longer the old harassed life of danger and hazard to which, as the companion of the missionary St. Paul, he was constantly exposed. He now filled the position of an honoured teacher and leader in a rich and organised church; many and grievous were the temptations to which, in such a station, he would be exposed.<p>Gold and popularity, gain and ease, were to be won with the sacrifice of <span class= "ital">apparently</span> so little, but with this sacrifice Timothy would cease to be the “man of God.” To maintain that St. Paul was aware of any weakness <span class= "ital">already</span> shown by his disciple and friend would, of course, be a baseless assertion; but that the older man dreaded for the younger these dangerous influences is clear. The term “man of God” was the common Old Testament name for “divine messengers,” but under the new covenant the name seems extended to all just men faithful to the Lord Jesus. (See <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm" title="That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished to all good works.">2Timothy 3:17</a>.) The solemn warning, then, through Timothy comes to each of His servants, “Flee <span class= "ital">thou</span> from covetousness.”<p><span class= "bld">And follow after righteousness.</span>—“The evil must be overcome with good” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/12-21.htm" title="Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.">Romans 12:21</a>). The “man of God,” tossing away from him all covetous longings, must press after “righteousness;” here used in a general sense, signifying “the inner life shaped after the Law of God.”<p><span class= "bld">Faith, love.</span>—The two characteristic virtues of Christianity. The one may be termed the hand that lays hold of God’s mercy; and the other the mainspring of the Christian’s life.<p><span class= "bld">Patience.</span>—That brave patience which, for Christ’s dear sake, with a smile can bear up against all sufferings.<p><span class= "bld">Meekness.</span>—The German “sanftmuth”—the meekness of heart and feeling with which a Christian acts towards his enemies. His conduct who “when he was reviled, reviled not again” best exemplifies this virtue.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness....">1 Timothy 6:11-12</a></span>. <span class="ital">But thou, O man of God </span>— Whatever all the world else do; (a man of God is either a prophet, a messenger of God, or a man devoted to God, a man of another world;) <span class="ital">flee </span>— As from a serpent, instead of coveting <span class="ital">these things, and follow after righteousness </span>— Truth, justice, mercy, with all their proper fruits; <span class="ital">godliness </span>— Sincere and fervent piety, implying devotedness to God, in heart and life, and a conformity to his image; <span class="ital">faith </span>— In all its branches, especially as having the perfections of God, and the truths and promises of his word for its object, implying an <span class="ital">evidence of things not seen, </span>and an <span class="ital">earnest of things hoped for, </span>with fidelity as to every trust committed to thee.

There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>But thou, O man of God, flee these things - These allurements of wealth, and these sad consequences which the love of gold produces.<p>And follow after righteousness, ... - Make these the grand object of your pursuit.

The phrase is taken out of the Old Testament, where the prophets, Elijah and Elisha, are so called, <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>, <p>flee these things; the Arabic version reads "these abominations"; namely, all questions and strifes of words, from whence so many evils follow, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm">1 Timothy 6:4</a> and all worldly gain, selfish interest, and mercenary views in religion; a wicked resolution to be rich, at any rate, and an immoderate love of the things of the world, and an eager pursuit after them, which expose to great danger, and even utter ruin; things very unbecoming any professor of religion, but much more a minister of the Gospel. <p>And follow after righteousness; not for justification before God, that he had followed after, and attained unto, which is the righteousness of Christ, and not of the law; but for the honour of religion before men; and intends the doing of justice between man and man, giving everyone their own, which in undue affection for the world sometimes leads men from: <p>godliness; spiritual religion, holiness of heart, and conversation, which has the promise of this life, as well as of the other, and with contentment is great gain; wherefore to pursue this is much better than greedily to run after the riches of this world, or with the false teachers to suppose that godliness lies in worldly gain, or in securing to a man his worldly interest: <p>faith; the grace of faith, which looks not to things seen, which are temporal, but to things not seen, which are eternal; and leads off the mind from sublunary enjoyments to God, and Christ, and the glories of another world; and is the leading grace to all others, and the foundation of good works, without which there is no pleasing in acts of moral righteousness, or in any acts of religious worship, which may be called godliness: <p>love; to God, which is inconsistent with serving mammon, or with an immoderate love of money; and to Christ, which will put a man on seeking, not his own things, but the things of Christ; and to the saints, which will direct him to serve them by acts of beneficence and liberality: <p>patience; in bearing reproaches and indignities; in suffering injuries, loss of goods, imprisonment, and every sort of persecution, for the sake of the Gospel; which a covetous disposition will not admit of: last of all, <p>meekness; or humility, not seeking great things, but being content with a lower station of life; for generally it is pride that puts men upon a determination to be rich at any rate: it may also design meekness in instructing the ignorant, in refuting error, and in reproving offenders. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{9}</span> But thou, O <span class="cverse3">{e}</span> man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.</span><p>(9) A peculiar exhortation to various virtues, with which it appropriate for the pastors especially to be furnished.<p>(e) Whom the Spirit of God rules.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/6.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-11.htm" title="But you, O man of God, flee these things; and follow after righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness.">1 Timothy 6:11</a>.

It marks the high tone of this final address; and is in keeping with the full dignity of title which in both these last contrasts of the false and the true ministry is given to the great Head of the Church’s ministry (and given here only in these Epistles) ‘Our Lord Jesus Christ.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">flee these</span> things] ‘Unsound words, and ungodly doctrine,’ ‘questionings and evil surmisings,’ ‘traffic in godliness and love of money.’ These three heads of evil, in the 3rd, 4th, and 5th to 10th verses respectively, are opposed by three pairs of contrasted virtues: ‘righteousness and godliness,’ ‘faith and love,’ ‘patience and meekness.’ In the first pair ‘the sound words,’ ‘the words of our Lord Jesus Christ,’ go to the very root of the matter as fully expounded, Romans 6. ‘Baptised into Christ Jesus … dead unto sin, but alive unto God in Christ Jesus … obedient from the heart to that form of teaching … ye became servants of <span class="ital">righteousness</span>,’ and 1 Corinthians 1. ‘We preach Christ crucified … Christ the power of God … of Him are ye in Christ Jesus, who was made unto us wisdom from God and <span class="ital">righteousness</span>’; all this being but the working out of the very ‘words of the Lord,’ <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/5-6.htm" title="Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.">Matthew 5:6</a>, ‘Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after <span class="ital">righteousness</span>, for they shall be filled.’ In the second pair ‘faith’ is as evidently the antidote to ‘ignorance,’ ‘questionings,’ and ‘disputes of words,’ as ‘love’ is to ‘envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings. In the third pair ‘patient endurance’ and ‘meekness of heart’ are well fitted to produce ‘<span class="ital">godliness</span> with <span class="ital">contentment</span>,’ as being the very graces to which ‘the words of the Lord’ assign the blessings of that ‘kingdom of heaven’ which <span class="ital">is</span> ‘godliness,’ and that ‘inheritance of the earth’ which <span class="ital">is</span> ‘contentment.’ ‘Blessed are the poor in spirit,’ ‘Blessed are the meek.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">meekness</span>] The compound word, <span class="bld">meekness of heart</span>, a word peculiar here, is to be read.

It indicates that the money-lovers just spoken of were not and could not be "men of God," whatever they might profess; and it leads with singular strength to the opposite direction in which Timothy's aspirations should point. The treasures which he must covet as "a man of God" were "righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience meekness." For the phrase, "man of God," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-17.htm">2 Timothy 3:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/1-21.htm">2 Peter 1:21</a>. In the Old Testament it always applies to a prophet (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-1.htm">Deuteronomy 33:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/13-6.htm">Judges 13:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-27.htm">1 Samuel 2:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-22.htm">1 Kings 12:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/1-9.htm">2 Kings 1:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-4.htm">Jeremiah 35:4</a>; and a great many other passages). St. Paul uses the expression with especial reference to Timothy and his holy office, and here, perhaps, in contrast with the <span class="greek">&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x1f7a;&#x3c2;&#x20;&#x1f00;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x1f7d;&#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3c2;</span> mentioned in ver. 9. <span class="cmt_word">Flee these things.</span> Note the sharp contrast between "the men" of the world, who reach after, and the man of God, who avoids, <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b3;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;</span>. The expression, "these things," is a little loose, but seems to apply to the love of money, and the desire to be rich, with all their attendant "foolish and hurtful lusts." The man of God avoids the perdition and maul fold sorrows of the covetous, by avoiding the covetousness which is their root. <span class="cmt_word">Follow after</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3b4;&#x1f77;&#x3c9;&#x3ba;&#x3b5;</span>); pursue, in direct contrast with <span class="greek">&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x1f7b;&#x3b3;&#x3b5;</span>, flee from, avoid (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-22.htm">2 Timothy 2:22</a>). <span class="cmt_word">Meekness</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x27;&#x3c5;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x1f77;&#x3b1;&#x3bd;</span>). This rare word, found in Philo, but nowhere in the New Testament, is the reading of the R.T. (instead of the <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x1fb3;&#x3bf;&#x37e;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;</span> of the T.R.) and accepted by almost all critics on the authority of all the older manuscripts. It has no perceptible difference of meaning from <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x1f79;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#x3c2;</span>, meekness or gentleness. <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/6.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>Man of God (&#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3c1;&#x3c9;&#x3c0;&#x3b5; &#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;)<p>The phrase only in Pastorals.
