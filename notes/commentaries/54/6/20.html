The Epistle, no doubt dictated by the old man, was in the handwriting of some friend of St. Paul and the Church, who acted as his scribe; but, as seems to have been sometimes his habit (see especially the closing words of the Galatian Letter), the last pleading reminder was added by the hand of the Apostle himself. “O Timothy”—he writes now no longer addressing church or pastor, but his own favourite friend and pupil, the loved heir of his God-inspired traditions and maxims, which so faithfully represented the doctrine and teaching of Jesus of Nazareth—“O Timothy, keep the sacred trust committed to thy charge.”<p>This “sacred trust,” so solemnly committed as the parting charge to Timothy, was “the doctrine delivered by St. Paul to him to preach,” the central point of which, we know from the Apostle’s other writings, was the teaching respecting the atonement and the precious blood of Christ. There is a beautiful, though somewhat lengthened, paraphrase of the “Trust” in the <span class= "ital">Commonitorium</span> of Vincentius Lirinensis, composed about A.D. 430. “What is meant,” he asks, “by ‘<span class= "ital">keep</span> the trust?’ The disciple of St. Paul must keep the sound doctrine of his master safe from robbers and foes. . . . What is meant by ‘the <span class= "ital">trust?</span>’ Something intrusted to you to keep—not a possession you have discovered for yourself; something you have received from another—not what you have thought out for yourself . . . of this ‘trust,’ remember, you are nothing but the guardian. . . . What, then, is the meaning of ‘<span class= "ital">keep the trust?</span>’ It is surely nothing else than ‘guard the treasure of the Catholic faith.’ . . . Gold have you received<span class= "ital">;</span> see that you hand gold on to others.”<p>“Is there, then,” asks this same wise writer “to be no progress, no development in religious teaching? Yes,” he answers; “there should be a real progress, a marked development, but it must partake of the nature of a progress, not of a change. . . . Let religion in the soul follow the example of the growth of the various members which compose the body, and which, as years roll on, become ever stronger and more perfect, but which, notwithstanding their growth and developed beauty, always remain the same.”<p><span class= "bld">Avoiding profane and vain babblings.</span>—The Apostle has before in this Epistle warned Timothy against these useless, profitless discussions. Anything like theological controversy and discussion seems to. have been distasteful to St. Paul, as tending to augment dissension and hatred, and to exalt into an undue prominence mere words and phrases.<p><span class= "bld">Oppositions of science falsely so called.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">of knowledge falsely so called.</span> These “oppositions” have been supposed by some to be a special allusion to some of the Gnostic theories of the opposition between the Law and the Gospel, of which peculiar school, later, Marcion was the great teacher. It is hardly likely that any <span class= "ital">definite</span> Gnostic teaching had as yet been heard in Ephesus, but there is little doubt that the seeds of much of the Gnosticism of the next century were—when St. Paul wrote to Timothy—being then sown in some of the Jewish schools of Ephesus and the neighbouring cities. (Comp. the allusions to these Jewish and cabalistic schools in St. Paul’s letter to the Colossian Church.) The “oppositions” here may be understood as referring generally to the theories of the false teachers, who were undermining the doctrine of St. Paul as taught by Timothy.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/6.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-20.htm" title="O Timothy, keep that which is committed to your trust, avoiding profane and vain babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called:...">1 Timothy 6:20-21</a></span>.

Nothing is more uncertain than worldly wealth. Those who are rich, must see that God gives them their riches; and he only can give to enjoy them richly; for many have riches, but enjoy them poorly, not having a heart to use them. What is the best estate worth, more than as it gives opportunity of doing the more good? Showing faith in Christ by fruits of love, let us lay hold on eternal life, when the self-indulgent, covetous, and ungodly around, lift up their eyes in torment. That learning which opposes the truth of the gospel, is not true science, or real knowledge, or it would approve the gospel, and consent to it. Those who advance reason above faith, are in danger of leaving faith. Grace includes all that is good, and grace is an earnest, a beginning of glory; wherever God gives grace, he will give glory.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Keep that which is committed to thy trust - All that is entrusted to you, and to which reference has been particularly made in this Epistle. The honor of the gospel, and the interests of religion, had been specially committed to him; and he was sacredly to guard this holy trust, and not suffer it to be wrested from him.<p>Avoiding profane and vain babblings - Greek, "Profane, empty words." The reference is to such controversies and doctrines as tended only to produce strife, and were not adapted to promote the edification of the church; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-4.htm">1 Timothy 1:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-7.htm">1 Timothy 4:7</a>.<p>And oppositions of science falsely so called - Religion has nothing to fear from true science, and the minister of the gospel is not exhorted to dread that. Real science, in all its advances, contributes to the support of religion; and just in proportion as that is promoted will it be found to sustain the Bible, and to confirm the claims of religion to the faith of mankind. See this illustrated at length in Wiseman's Lectures on the connection between science and religion. It is only false or pretended science that religion has to dread, and which the friend of Christianity is to avoid. The meaning here is, that Timothy was to avoid everything which falsely laid claim to being "knowledge" or "science." There was much of this in the world at the time the apostle wrote; and this, more perhaps than anything else, has tended to corrupt true religion since. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20, 21. Recapitulatory conclusion: the main aim of the whole Epistle being here summarily stated.<p>O Timothy&#8212;a personal appeal, marking at once his affection for Timothy, and his prescience of the coming heresies.<p>keep&#8212;from spiritual thieves, and from enemies who will, while men sleep, sow tares amidst the good seed sown by the Son of man.<p>that which is committed to thy trust&#8212;Greek, "the deposit" (1Ti 1:18; 2Ti 1:12, 14; 2:2). "The true" or "sound doctrine" to be taught, as opposed to "the science falsely so called," which leads to "error concerning the faith" (1Ti 6:21). "It is not thine: it is another's property with which thou hast been entrusted: Diminish it not at all" [Chrysostom]. "That which was entrusted to thee, not found by thee; which thou hast received, not invented; a matter not of genius, but of teaching; not of private usurpation, but of public tradition; a matter brought to thee, not put forth by thee, in which thou oughtest to be not an enlarger, but a guardian; not an originator, but a disciple; not leading, but following. 'Keep,' saith he, 'the deposit,'; preserve intact and inviolate the talent of the catholic faith. What has been entrusted to thee, let that same remain with thee; let that same be handed down by thee. Gold thou hast received, gold return. I should be sorry thou shouldest substitute aught else. I should be sorry that for gold thou shouldest substitute lead impudently, or brass fraudulently. I do not want the mere appearance of gold, but its actual reality. Not that there is to be no progress in religion in Christ's Church. Let there be so by all means, and the greatest progress; but then let it be real progress, not a change of the faith. Let the intelligence of the whole Church and its individual members increase exceedingly, provided it be only in its own kind, the doctrine being still the same. Let the religion of the soul resemble the growth of the body,which, though it develops its several parts in the progress of years, yet remains the same as it was essentially" [Vincentius Lirinensis, A.D. 434].<p>avoiding&#8212;"turning away from" (compare 2Ti 3:4). Even as they have "turned away from the truth" (1Ti 1:6; 5:15; 2Ti 4:4).<p>profane&#8212;(1Ti 4:7; 2Ti 2:16).<p>vain&#8212;Greek, "empty": mere "strifes of words," 1Ti 6:4, producing no moral fruit.<p>oppositions&#8212;dialectic antithesis of the false teachers [Alford]. Wiesinger, not so probably, "oppositions to the sound doctrine." I think it likely germs existed already of the heresy of dualistic oppositions, namely, between the good and evil principle, afterwards fully developed in Gnosticism. Contrast Paul's just antithesis (1Ti 3:16; 6:5, 6; 2Ti 2:15-23).<p>science falsely so called&#8212;where there is not faith, there is not knowledge [Chrysostom]. There was true "knowledge," a special gift of the Spirit, which was abused by some (1Co 8:1; 12:8; 14:6). This gift was soon counterfeited by false teachers arrogating to themselves pre-eminently the gift (Col 2:8, 18, 23). Hence arose the creeds of the Church, called symbols, that is, in Greek, "watchwords," or a test whereby the orthodox might distinguish one another in opposition to the heretical. Perhaps here, 1Ti 6:20, and 2Ti 1:13, 14, imply the existence of some such brief formula of doctrine then existing in the Church; if so, we see a good reason for its not being written in Scripture, which is designed not to give dogmatic formularies, but to be the fountain whence all such formularies are to be drawn according to the exigencies of the several churches and ages. Probably thus a portion of the so-called apostle's creed may have had their sanction, and been preserved solely by tradition on this account. "The creed, handed down from the apostles, is not written on paper and with ink, but on fleshy tables of the heart" Jerome [Against John of Jerusalem, 9]. Thus, in the creed, contrary to the "oppositions" (the germs of which probably existed in the Church in Paul's latter days) whereby the aeons were set off in pairs, God is stated to be "the Father Almighty," or all-governing "maker of heaven and earth" [Bishop Hinds].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">O Timothy, keep that which is committed to thy trust; </span> either the doctrine of the gospel, which ministers ought to keep pure, and without mixture, or the ministerial office; be true and faithful in the discharge of it, preaching Christ and the doctrine of Christ. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Avoiding profane and vain babblings; </span> avoid all impertinent discoursings under the notion of preaching, which in thy discharge of that work are the best of them but profane babblings. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">And oppositions of science falsely so called; </span> avoid also all idle speculations, and disputations, no way serving to the end of preaching, and falsely called science. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Keep that which is committed to thy trust,....

And it may also include his gifts for the ministration of it, which were to be kept in use, and stirred up, and not neglected, but cultivated and improved to the advantage of the church, and of the interest of Christ: <p>avoiding profane and vain babblings; about the law, and circumcision, and other things, which the false teachers insisted much on, and amused their hearers with; and which were vain, empty, useless, and unprofitable talk. Some copies, and so the Vulgate Latin version, read, "profane newnesses of words"; or new words, which ought not to be introduced, for they often bring in new doctrines: the form of sound words, the wholesome words, the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, the words which the Holy Ghost teacheth, should be held fast; and especially all new words should be avoided, which are contrary to them, or in the least weaken them, or detract from them. <p>And oppositions of science falsely so called; the false teachers boasted of their science and knowledge, but it was not true, solid, spiritual, and saving; it was not an experimental knowledge of the Gospel; it was not the excellent knowledge of Christ, which has eternal life connected with it; it was merely notional and speculative; it was idle, empty, and useless, mere Pagan philosophy, and vain deceit, upon which they formed antitheses, or oppositions and objections to the truths of the Gospel; and even opposed themselves, and the word of God, as well as the faithful ministers of it. <p>(Knowledge is not determined by a "show of hands".

Final exhortation and benediction to Timothy. The apostle begins fervently and impressively with: <span class="greekheb">ὦ Τιμόθεε</span> (Matthies).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τὴν παραθήκην φύλαξον</span>] comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-12.htm" title="For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed to him against that day.">2 Timothy 1:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-14.htm" title="That good thing which was committed to you keep by the Holy Ghost which dwells in us.">2 Timothy 1:14</a>; <span class="greekheb">παραθήκη</span> is a “possession entrusted;” Paul does not say what kind of possession. Even in these parallel passages a more precise definition is not given, except that at <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-12.htm" title="Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, whereunto you are also called, and have professed a good profession before many witnesses.">1 Timothy 6:12</a> he denotes by <span class="greekheb">μου</span> that it is entrusted to him, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm" title="That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Timothy 6:14</a> adds the adjective <span class="greekheb">καλήν</span>. In any case there is meant by it here a gift entrusted to Timothy by God, which gift he is to preserve (<span class="greekheb">φύλαξον</span>) from every hurt. As the apostle puts its preservation (<span class="greekheb">φυλάσσειν</span>) in close connection with the <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρέπεσθαι</span> of the heretics, we may understand by it either Timothy’s <span class="greekheb">διακονία</span> (de Wette, Otto), or the gospel, “sound doctrine” (Wiesinger, van Oosterzee, Hofmann).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As the chief purpose of the epistle is to instruct Timothy regarding his conduct in the ministry committed to him, it seems right to understand by <span class="greekheb">παραθήκη</span> a possession entrusted, not to all Christians, but to Timothy in particular. Thus—in spite of the absence of <span class="greekheb">σου</span>—the first view deserves the preference, all the more that in the other passages quoted this meaning of the word is the most suitable. The next word, <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρεπόμενος</span>, shows that Timothy would injure his office by entering upon the <span class="greekheb">βέβηλοι κενοφωνίαι</span>. Plitt arbitrarily takes <span class="greekheb">παραθήκη</span> as equivalent to “eternal life.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐκτρεπόμενος τὰς βεβήλους κενοφωνίας</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐκτρέπεσθαι</span>, properly: “turn away from anything;” then with the accusative (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2 Timothy 3:5</a> : <span class="greekheb">ἀποτρέπεσθαι</span>): “<span class="ital">avoid</span>,” synonymous with <span class="greekheb">παραιτεῖσθαι</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κενοφωνία</span>] synonymous with <span class="greekheb">ματαιολογία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-6.htm" title="From which some having swerved have turned aside to vain jangling;">1 Timothy 1:6</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm" title="But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.">2 Timothy 2:16</a> : “<span class="ital">empty talk without anything in it</span>.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>This talk is still more precisely defined by the next words: <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀντιθέσεις τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως</span>] It is to be observed that <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθέσεις</span> is closely connected with the previous <span class="greekheb">κενοφωνίας</span>, the article <span class="greekheb">τάς</span> belonging to both words and the genitive <span class="greekheb">τῆς ψευδ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γνώσεως</span> referring to both alike. Hence <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθέσεις</span> must here express some thought corresponding with <span class="greekheb">κενοφωνίας</span>. It is not therefore advisable to understand by it in general terms “the statutes of the heretics against the gospel” (Matthies, Wiesinger), or “the controversial theses of the heretics directed against the gospel” (so before in this commentary[210]); it is much more correct to understand it of the theses which the heretics sought to maintain against one another (Hofmann). Thus understood, the word corresponds to <span class="greekheb">λογομαχίαι</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-4.htm" title="He is proud, knowing nothing, but doting about questions and strifes of words, whereof comes envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings,">1 Timothy 6:4</a>. It is possible that these had the character of <span class="ital">dialectic</span> proofs (Conybeare and Howson, quoted in van Oosterzee), but the word itself does not show this. Baur’s assertion is purely arbitrary, that the contrariae oppositiones are here meant which Marcion exerted himself to establish between the law and the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως</span>] The expression is easily explained by the fact that the heretics boasted of possessing a knowledge, a <span class="greekheb">φιλοσοφία</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm" title=" Beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.">Colossians 2:8</a>), in which there was a more perfect science of divine things than that presented by the gospel.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Paul was also acquainted with a <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span>, which, however, was rooted in faith, and was effected by the <span class="greekheb">πνεῦμα Χριστοῦ</span>. But the <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> of the heretics did not deserve this name, and hence Paul called it <span class="greekheb">ψευδώνυμος</span> (occurring only here in the N. T.); on which Chrysostom aptly remarks: <span class="greekheb">ὅταν γὰρ πίστις μὴ εἶ</span>, <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις οὐκ ἔστιν</span>. Baur, without just ground, seeks to draw from the use of this word a proof for his hypothesis that the epistle was composed at the date of the heresy of Marcion.—<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-21.htm" title="Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

The meaning of <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθ</span>. is partly fixed by <span class="greekheb">κενοφωνίας</span>, to which it is in some sort an explanatory appendix; but it must finally depend upon the signification we attach to <span class="greekheb">τῆς ψευδωνύμου γνώσεως</span>. The epithet <span class="greekheb">ψευδων</span>. is sufficient to prove that <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> was specially claimed by the heretics whom St. Paul has in his mind. That it should be so is in harmony with the other notices which we find in these epistles suggestive of a puerile and profitless intellectual subtlety, as opposed to the practical moral character of Christianity. We are reminded of the contrast in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/8-1.htm" title="Now as touching things offered to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but charity edifies.">1 Corinthians 8:1</a>, “Knowledge puffeth up, but love buildeth up”. Hort (<span class="ital">Judaistic Christianity</span>, p. 139 <span class="ital">sqq</span>.) proves that <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> here and elsewhere in N.T. (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/11-52.htm" title="Woe to you, lawyers! for you have taken away the key of knowledge: you entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in you hindered.">Luke 11:52</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/2-20.htm" title="An instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, which have the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law.">Romans 2:20</a> <span class="ital">sq</span>.) refers to the special lore of those who interpreted mystically the O.T., especially the Law. Knowledge which is merely theoretical, the knowledge of God professed by those who “by their works deny Him” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/1-16.htm" title="They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abominable, and disobedient, and to every good work reprobate.">Titus 1:16</a>), is not real knowledge. The <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθέσεις</span> then of this spurious knowledge would be the dialectical distinctions and niceties of the false teachers. Perhaps <span class="ital">inconsistencies</span> is what is meant. For an example of <span class="greekheb">ἀντίθετος</span> in this sense, see Moulton and Milligan, <span class="ital">Expositor</span>, vii., 6:275. Something more definite than (<span class="ital">a</span>) <span class="ital">oppositions, i.e., objections</span> of opponents (so Chrys.

The words which follow are alone sufficient to make (3) the certain reference. In effect, to use the words quoted from St Vincent of the island-school of Lerins (the author of the famous canon of Christian doctrine ‘quod semper quod ubique quod ab omnibus’), St Paul says to Timothy ‘Depositum custodi: <span class="ital">catholicae fidei talentum</span> inviolatum illibatumque conserva.’<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">avoiding profane</span> and <span class="ital">vain babblings</span>] Lit. <span class="bld">turning away from the profane babblings</span>; the article with ‘babblings’ and not with ‘oppositions ‘shews that both go together, with ‘knowledge.’ ‘Babblings is another of the ‘Pastoral’ compounds recurring in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-16.htm" title="But shun profane and vain babblings: for they will increase to more ungodliness.">2 Timothy 2:16</a>. The word is literally ‘empty voicings,’ vox et praeterea nihil, windbag; speculations and errors which are the complete opposite of the solid Church truth on its firm foundation and rock, ‘Thou art the Christ.’ For the accus. after this verb, cf.

T. with direct reference to the heretical teaching, though the allusions, both with substantive and verb, imply that assumptions of superior knowledge were among the claims of the new theology. The ‘oppositions’ meant are probably the <span class="ital">dualistic</span> oppositions between the good and evil principle, see introduction, pp. 45, 46; though some explain them as the dialectical niceties and subtle rhetorical antitheses of the teachers. See Dr Hort’s interpretation, Appendix B.

Barbarous words were formerly used by the Magi, which are said to have a secret power, though they have in reality none, and are altogether vain. Paul seems to have had respect to this circumstance, as he has substituted the more significant term; for <span class="greekheb">φωνὴ</span>, a voice, an utterance, expresses vehemence; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_timothy/2-15.htm" title="Study to show yourself approved to God, a workman that needs not to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth....">2 Timothy 2:15-16</a>, note, [where <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον τῆς ἀληθείας</span> is opposed to <span class="greekheb">κενοφωνίας</span>; the <span class="greekheb">φωνὴ</span>, implying vehemence of voice, being opposed to temperate speech or word, <span class="greekheb">λόγος</span>]. Moreover, the word <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span> agrees with the Hebrew <span class="greekheb">ידעוני</span>, a wizard, in the passage quoted above, which the Greeks, in the books of Samuel and Kings at least, have interpreted <span class="greekheb">γνώστην</span> [as we use the term, “a wise man,” of a dealer in magic, a wizard]. And in this way, Paul calls the false teachers by the terms signifying magi and magic, to show how much he held them in abomination: comp. <span class="greekheb">γόητες</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-13.htm" title="But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived.">2 Timothy 3:13</a>. Clemens Al., l. 2, Strom. f. 280, puts under these words of Paul the following: <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ ταύτης ἐλεγχόμενοι τῆς φωνῆς οἱ ἀπὸ τῶν αἱρέσεων</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς πρὸς Τιμόθεον ἀθετοῦσιν ἐπιστολάς</span>, “the heretics being reproved by this word (voice), reject the Epistles to Timothy.”—<span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀντιθέσεις</span>, and oppositions) A false <span class="greekheb">γνῶσις</span>, knowledge, curiously set forth (puffed off) various oppositions taken from philosophy, pretending that there are two Gods opposed to each other as rivals (<span class="greekheb">ἀντιτέχνους</span>), the one good and the other bad; and in both, that there are wonderful <span class="greekheb">ἀντιστοιχίας</span>, corresponding oppositions. Paul notices these oppositions, and at the same time severely ridicules them by a play on the words; because their teachers oppose themselves to the truth, and their <span class="greekheb">θέσεις</span>, positions [taken out of <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθέσεις</span>, oppositions], are contrary to the ‘foundation’ already laid. See the conjugates, <span class="greekheb">ἀντιδιατιθεμένους</span> and <span class="greekheb">θεμέλιος</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-25.htm" title="In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth;">2 Timothy 2:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/2-19.htm" title="Nevertheless the foundation of God stands sure, having this seal, The Lord knows them that are his. And, Let every one that names the name of Christ depart from iniquity.">2 Timothy 2:19</a>. On the other hand, Paul himself, in his epistles, especially to Timothy, handles most wise oppositions or <span class="greekheb">ἀντιθέσεις</span>: for example, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/1-7.htm" title="Desiring to be teachers of the law; understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm....">1 Timothy 1:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-16.htm" title="And without controversy great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifest in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen of angels, preached to the Gentiles, believed on in the world, received up into glory.">1 Timothy 3:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/4-1.htm" title="Now the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils;">1 Timothy 4:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/4-6.htm" title="If you put the brothers in remembrance of these things, you shall be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished up in the words of faith and of good doctrine, whereunto you have attained....">1 Timothy 4:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/6-2.htm" title="And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather do them service, because they are faithful and beloved, partakers of the benefit.

"That good thing which was committed unto thee guard ['keep,' A.V.]." There does not seem to be any difference between <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span> and <span class="greek">&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b8;&#x1f75;&#x3ba;&#x3b7;</span>, which both mean "a deposit," and are used indifferently in classical Greek, though the latter is the more common. The precept to Timothy here is to keep diligent and watchful guard over the faith committed to his trust; to preserve it unaltered and uncorrupt, so as to hand it down to his successors exactly the same as he had received it.

It is a term used in logic and in rhetoric by Plato, Aristotle, etc., for "oppositions" and "antitheses," laying one doctrine by the side of another for comparison, or contrast, or refutation. It seems to allude to the particular method used by the heretics to establish their tenets, in opposition to the statements of the Church on particular points - such as the Law, the Resurrection, etc. <span class="cmt_word">The knowledge which is falsely so called.</span> There is a very similar intimation of the growth of an empty philosophy, whose teaching was antagonistic to the teaching of Christ in <a href="https://biblehub.com/colossians/2-8.htm">Colossians 2:8</a>, and with which St. Paul contrasts the true <span class="greek">&#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x1f7d;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2;</span> in ver. 3.

Used here, in its simple sense, of the arguments and teachings of those who opposed the true Christian doctrine as intrusted to Timothy. &#x393;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; knowledge was the characteristic word of the Gnostic school, the most formidable enemy of the church of the second century. The Gnostics claimed a superior knowledge peculiar to an intellectual caste. According to them, it was by this philosophic insight, as opposed to faith, that humanity was to be regenerated. faith was suited only to the rude masses, the animal-men. The intellectual questions which occupied these teachers were two: to explain the work of creation, and to account for the existence of evil. Their ethical problem was how to develop the higher nature in the environment of matter which was essentially evil. In morals they ran to two opposite extremes - asceticism and licentiousness. The principal representatives of the school were Basilides, Valentinus, and Marcion. Although Gnosticism as a distinct system did not reach its full development until about the middle of the second century, foreshadowings of it appear in the heresy at which Paul's Colossian letter was aimed. It is not strange if we find in the Pastoral Epistles allusions pointing to Gnostic errors; but, as already remarked, it is impossible to refer these allusions to any one definite system of error. The word &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; cannot therefore be interpreted to mean the Gnostic system; while it may properly be understood as referring to that conceit of knowledge which opposed itself to the Christian faith. &#x3a8;&#x3b5;&#x3c5;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c5;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; falsely-named, N.T.o. olxx.
