It was that he should keep the commandment without spot, unrebukeable. The commandment was the teaching of Jesus Christ, the gospel message, <span class= "ital">that</span> was to be proclaimed in all its fulness; and that this might be done effectually it was needful that the life of its preacher should be without flaw—blameless; in other words, it was absolutely requisite that the chief pastor in Ephesus should <span class= "ital">live</span> the life he preached. There were those (the false teachers of whom he had been speaking, well known to Timothy) whose lives had dishonoured the glorious commandment they professed to love and teach.<p><span class= "bld">Until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</span>—The speedy return of the Lord in glory was, no doubt, looked for in the Church of the first days. The expressions of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_thessalonians/4-15.htm" title="For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep.">1Thessalonians 4:15-18</a> evidently were written at a time when the second advent of Messiah was looked on as probably near at hand. By slow degrees—as one great teacher of the first days after the other fell asleep in Jesus, and the first generation of believers was rapidly passing away, and no fresh sign of the coming in glory was manifested—the strong expressions used in the first fervour which succeeded the Pentecost morning began to be qualified, as in this Epistle, written far on in St. Paul’s life, by words which seemed to say to Timothy: “Keep the Master’s commandment pure and blameless till the hour of that glorious Epiphany which your eyes will possibly behold.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>6:11-16 It ill becomes any men, but especially men of God, to set their hearts upon the things of this world; men of God should be taken up with the things of God. There must be a conflict with corruption, and temptations, and the powers of darkness. Eternal life is the crown proposed for our encouragement. We are called to lay hold thereon. To the rich must especially be pointed out their dangers and duties, as to the proper use of wealth. But who can give such a charge, that is not himself above the love of things that wealth can buy? The appearing of Christ is certain, but it is not for us to know the time. Mortal eyes cannot bear the brightness of the Divine glory. None can approach him except as he is made known unto sinners in and by Christ. The Godhead is here adored without distinction of Persons, as all these things are properly spoken, whether of the Father, the Son, or the Holy Ghost. God is revealed to us, only in and through the human nature of Christ, as the only begotten Son of the Father.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>That thou keep this commandment - Referring particularly to the solemn injunction which he had just given him, to "fight the good fight of faith," but perhaps also including all that he had enjoined on him.<p>Without spot - It seems harsh, and is unusual, to apply the epithet, "without spot" - &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  aspilos - to a command or doctrine, and the passage may be so construed that this may be understood as referring to Timothy himself - "That thou keep the commandment so that thou mayest be without spot and unrebukable."

Believers then used in their practice to set before themselves the day of Christ as near at hand; we, the hour of death [Bengel]. The fact has in all ages of the Church been certain, the time as uncertain to Paul, as it is to us; hence, 1Ti 6:15, he says, "in His times": the Church's true attitude is that of continual expectation of her Lord's return (1Co 1:8; Php 1:6, 10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/6.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The charge is, that he faithfully perform all the duties belonging to him as a Christian and a minister, commissioned from God, in the whole course of his life, that he may not be liable to a just accusation for the neglect of any part of his office. This is enforced by the consideration of the appearance of our Lord Jesus Christ, that is, in the day of judgment, as the following words make evident. Yet the apostle seems to speak of it, as if Timothy should continue in his ministry till that appearance. But it is manifest by his cautionlug the Thessalonians against that false conceit, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-2.htm" title="That you be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.">2 Thessalonians 2:2</a>,3</span>, that the apostle knew the contrary; for he assures them that that day should not come till many great things enumerated by him should be accomplished. The meaning therefore of the words <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, </span> is the same with our Saviour’s command to the angel of the church of Smyrna: <span class="ital">Be thou faithful unto death, </span><span class="bldvs"> <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-10.htm" title="Fear none of those things which you shall suffer: behold, the devil shall cast some of you into prison, that you may be tried; and you shall have tribulation ten days: be you faithful to death, and I will give you a crown of life.">Revelation 2:10</a></span>: for the whole flux of time from the death of any person till the day of judgment makes no alteration in his life; and consequently, whoever is faithful unto the death is so till the appearing of Christ. And there is no motive more powerful to a zealous and faithful discharge of our duty, no excitation more rousing from the security and carelessness of the flesh, than the serious believing consideration of the glorious reward to be dispersed by our Saviour to his faithful servants in that day, and the dreadful condemnation that shall pass upon those who have been careless and negligent in the sacred ministry. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/6.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>That thou keep this commandment,.... Meaning either what he had now last of all enjoined him, to fight the good fight of faith; or the whole of the orders he had given him throughout the epistle, relating both to the doctrine and discipline of the house of God; or rather the work and office of preaching the Gospel, which was committed to him by the Holy Ghost, and enjoined him by the commandment of the everlasting God: and this the apostle, before God and Christ, charges him to observe and keep, in the following manner, <p>without spot, and unrebukeable; the sense is, that he would discharge his ministerial function with all faithfulness and purity; that he would sincerely, and without any adulteration, preach the pure Gospel of Christ; and that he would so behave in his life and conversation, that his ministry might not be justly blamed by men, or he be rebuked by the church here, or by Christ hereafter: and this he would have him do, <p>until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ; to judge the quick and dead at the last day, and which will be very illustrious and glorious. Now Christ is hid from the eyes of men, but to them that look for him he will appear a second time in great glory; in the glory of his Father, and of his own, and of the holy angels; and when his saints will appear with him in glory: and this the apostle the rather mentions, since every man's work and ministry will then be made manifest; this bright day of Christ's appearing will declare it, and everyone must give an account of himself, and his talents, unto him: and this shows that the apostle did not design this charge, and these instructions, for Timothy only, but for all other ministers of the Gospel, till the second coming of Christ; though this was then, as now, so much unknown, when it would be, that it could not be said but Timothy might live unto it. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">That thou keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/6.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-14.htm" title="That you keep this commandment without spot, unrebukable, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ:">1 Timothy 6:14</a>. <span class="greekheb">τηρῆσαι κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>.: The phrase <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν τὴν ἐντολήν</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰς ἐντολάς</span> or <span class="greekheb">τὸν λόγον</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοὺς λόγους</span> is a common one; found in <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/19-17.htm" title="And he said to him, Why call you me good? there is none good but one, that is, God: but if you will enter into life, keep the commandments.">Matthew 19:17</a>, and especially in the Johannine writings; but wherever it occurs it means <span class="ital">to obey</span> or <span class="ital">observe</span> a command or a saying; whereas here it means <span class="ital">to preserve intact</span>. Perhaps the two meanings were present to the apostle’s mind; and no doubt in actual experience they merge one into the other; for a tradition is only preserved by obedience to the demand which it makes for observance. This use of the verb and the similar <span class="greekheb">τὴν πίστιν τετήρηκα</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/4-7.htm" title="I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:">2 Timothy 4:7</a>, mutually illustrate each other. <span class="greekheb">τὴν ἐντολὴν τηρεῖν</span> is probably equivalent to <span class="greekheb">τὴν παραθήκην φυλάσσειν</span>, understanding the <span class="ital">tradition</span> or <span class="ital">deposit</span> in the most comprehensive moral and spiritual sense, in which it is nothing else than “the law of the Gospel (<span class="ital">cf.</span> <span class="greekheb">ἡ παραγγελία</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-5.htm" title="Now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart, and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned:">1 Timothy 1:5</a>), the Gospel viewed as a rule of life” (so Ell. and Alf.). St. Paul would not have distinguished this from the charge given to Timothy at his baptism. Cyril Jer. (<span class="ital">Cat</span>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-13.htm" title="I give you charge in the sight of God, who vivifies all things, and before Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed a good confession;">1 Timothy 6:13</a>), in quoting this passage, substitutes <span class="greekheb">ταύτην τὴν παραδεδομένην πίστιν</span> for <span class="greekheb">ἐντολήν</span>. This interpretation is permissible so long as we do not divorce creed from character.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἄσπιλον ἀνεπίλημπτον</span>: These epithets present a difficulty somewhat similar to that presented by <span class="greekheb">τηρῆσαι</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἄσπιλος</span> is a personal epithet (though applied to <span class="greekheb">οὐρανός</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/15-15.htm" title="Behold, he puts no trust in his saints; yes, the heavens are not clean in his sight.">Job 15:15</a>, Symm.); and so is <span class="greekheb">ἀνεπίλημπτος</span>. See reff. on both. Alford shows, after De Wette, by examples from Philo and Plato, that <span class="greekheb">ἀνεπίλ</span>. may be applied to impersonal objects, such as <span class="greekheb">τέχνη</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὸ λεγόμενον</span>. Nevertheless although it would be intolerably awkward to refer the adjectives to <span class="greekheb">σε</span>—the ordinary construction with <span class="greekheb">τηρεῖν</span> being that the qualifying adj. should belong to its object, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-22.htm" title="Lay hands suddenly on no man, neither be partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.">1 Timothy 5:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/james/1-27.htm" title="Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.">Jam 1:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-9.htm" title="And when I was present with you, and wanted, I was chargeable to no man: for that which was lacking to me the brothers which came from Macedonia supplied: and in all things I have kept myself from being burdensome to you, and so will I keep myself.">2 Corinthians 11:9</a> (Alf.)—yet St. Paul had the personal reference to Timothy chiefly in his mind when he chose these words as qualifying <span class="greekheb">ἐντολήν</span>; and the R.V., which places a comma after <span class="ital">commandment</span>, possibly is intended to suggest a similar view.

It is quite possible that the word &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3b1;, so characteristic of these Epistles, grew out of the Gnostic vocabulary, in which it was used of the sudden appearing of the hitherto concealed heavenly aeon, Christ. This they compared to a sudden light from heaven; and Christ, who thus appeared, though only docetically, without an actual fleshly body, was styled &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3c1; savior, although his oneness with the God of creation was denied. The Creator and the Redeemer were not the same, but were rather opposed. Christ was only a factor of a great cosmological process of development. As Neander observes: "The distinctive aim of the Gnostics was to apprehend the appearance of Christ and the new creation proceeding from him in their connection with the evolution of the whole universe." </body></html>
