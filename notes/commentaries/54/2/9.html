These elaborate adornments, so likely to catch the eye at divine worship, were quite inconsistent with Christian simplicity, besides being calculated to distract the attention of their fellow worshippers, male as well as female. On this question of seemly, quiet apparel, in an assembly gathered for divine worship, see the difficult verse, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-10.htm" title="For this cause ought the woman to have power on her head because of the angels.">1Corinthians 11:10</a>, where <span class= "ital">another</span> and a still graver reason for modest demeanour and apparel of women is alleged—“because of the angels.”<p><span class= "bld">Pearls, or costly array.</span>—Ear-rings, necklaces, bracelets, are included here; these costly ornaments were worn by the ladies of the luxurious age in which St. Paul lived, in great profusion.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;...">1 Timothy 2:9-10</a></span>. <span class="ital">In like manner also, </span>I command <span class="ital">that women </span>— Particularly when they are about to appear in public assemblies for divine worship; <span class="ital">adorn themselves in modest </span>— <span class="greekheb">Κοσμιω</span>, <span class="ital">decent, </span>or <span class="ital">becoming, apparel </span>— Neither too costly nor sordid, but what is neat and clean, as the word signifies, and suitable to their place and calling. The word <span class="greekheb">καταστολη</span>, rendered <span class="ital">apparel, </span>according to Theophylact and Œcumenius, was a long upper garment which covered the body every way. What the apostle especially forbids is that immodest manner of dressing which is calculated to excite impure desires in the spectators, or a vain admiration of the beauty of those that use it: also that gaudiness or showiness of dress which proceeds from vanity, and nourishes vanity, wastes time and money, and so prevents many good works. <span class="ital">With shamefacedness </span>— <span class="greekheb">Μετα αιδους</span>, <span class="ital">with modesty, </span>teaching to avoid every thing unbecoming; <span class="ital">and sobriety </span>— Or <span class="ital">soundness of mind, </span>as <span class="greekheb">σωφροσυνη </span>signifies, which will prevent all unnecessary expense. This latter expression, in St. Paul’s sense, signifies the virtue that governs our whole life according to true wisdom. <span class="ital">Not with broidered — Plaited, </span>or rather <span class="ital">curled </span>hair, as <span class="greekheb">πλεγμασιν </span>properly signifies; <span class="ital">or gold </span>— Worn by way of ornament; <span class="ital">or pearls </span>— Jewels of any kind; (a part is put for the whole;) <span class="ital">or costly array </span>— <span class="greekheb">Ιματισμω πολυτελει</span>, <span class="ital">expensive clothing. </span>These four things are expressly forbidden by name to all women, (there is no exception,) <span class="ital">professing godliness </span>— And no art of man can reconcile with the Christian profession, the wilful violation of an express command. <span class="ital">But </span>— Instead of these vain ornaments, (what is itself infinitely more valuable, and much better <span class="ital">becometh women professing godliness, </span>and the gospel of Christ, the great rule of it,) <span class="ital">with good works </span>— That is, works of mercy and charity to their fellow- creatures, which will render them amiable in the eyes of God himself, and of all wise and virtuous persons with whom they converse.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In like manner also - That is, with the same propriety; with the same regard to what religion demands. The apostle had stated particularly the duty of men in public worship <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, and he now proceeds to state the duty of women. All the directions here evidently refer to the proper manner of conducting public worship, and not to private duties; and the object here is to state the way in which he would have the different sexes appear. He had said that he would have prayers offered for all people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-1.htm">1 Timothy 2:1</a> ff), and that in offering such petitions he would have the men on whom devolved the duty of conducting public devotion, do it with holy hands, and without any intermingling of passion, and with entire freedom from the spirit of contention. In reference to the duty of females in attendance on public worship, he says that he would have them appear in apparel suitable to the place and the occasion - adorned not after the manner of the world, but with the zeal and love in the cause of the Redeemer which became Christians. He would not have a woman become a public teacher <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-12.htm">1 Timothy 2:12</a>, but would wish her ever to occupy the place in society for which she was designed <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-11.htm">1 Timothy 2:11</a>, and to which she had shown that she was adapted; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-13.htm">1 Timothy 2:13-14</a>. The direction in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm">1 Timothy 2:9-12</a>, therefore, is to be understood particularly of the proper deportment of females in the duties of public worship. At the same time, the principles laid down are doubtless such as were intended to apply to them in the other situations in life, for if modest apparel is appropriate in the sanctuary, it is appropriate everywhere. If what is here prohibited in dress is wrong there, it would be difficult to show that it is right elsewhere.<p>That women adorn themselves - The words "I will" are to be understood here as repeated from <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm">1 Timothy 2:8</a>. The apostle by the use of the word "adorn" (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;  kosmein), shows that he is not opposed to ornament or adorning, provided it be of the right kind. The world, as God has made it, is full of beauty, and he has shown in each flower that he is not opposed to true ornament. There are multitudes of things which, so far as we can see, appear to be designed for mere ornament, or are made merely because they are beautiful. Religion does not forbid true adorning. It differs from the world only on the question what "is" true ornament, or what it becomes us, all things considered, to do in the situation in which we are placed, the character which we sustain, the duties which we have to perform, and the profession which we make. It may be that there are ornaments in heaven which would be anything but appropriate for the condition of a poor, lost, dying sinner on earth.<p>In modest apparel - The word here rendered "modest" (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kosmios), properly relates to ornament, or decoration, and means that which is "well-ordered, decorous, becoming." It does not, properly, mean modest in the sense of being opposed to that which is immodest, or which tends to excite improper passions and desires, but that which is becoming or appropriate. The apostle does not positively specify what this would be, but he mentions somethings which are to be excluded from it, and which, in his view, are inconsistent with the true adorning of Christian females - "broidered hair, gold, pearls, costly array." The sense here is, that the apparel of females should be such as becomes them, or is appropriate to them. The word here used (&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;  kosmios), shows that there should be due attention that it may be truly neat, fit, decorous. There is no religion in a negligent mode of apparel, or in inattention to personal appearance - anymore than there is in wearing gold and pearls; and a female may as truly violate the precepts of her religion by neglecting her personal appearance as by excessive attention to it. The true idea here is, that her attention to her appearance should be such that she will be offensive to no class of persons; such as to show that her mind is supremely fixed on higher and more important things, and such as to interfere with no duty which she owes, and no good which she can do, either by spending her time needlessly in personal adorning, or by lavishing that money for dress which might do good to others, or by neglecting the proprieties of her station, and making herself offensive to others.<p>With shamefacedness - With modesty of appearance and manner - an eminent female virtue, whether in the sanctuary or at home.<p>And sobriety - The word here used means, properly, "sanity;" then sober-mindedness, moderation of the desires and passions. It is opposed to all that is frivolous, and to all undue excitement of the passions. The idea is, that in their apparel and deportment they should not entrench on the strictest decorum. Doddridge.<p>Not with broidered hair - Margin, "plaited." Females in the East pay much more attention to the hair than is commonly done with us. It is plaited with great care, and arranged in various forms, according to the prevailing fashion, and often ornamented with spangles or with silver wire or tissue interwoven; see the notes on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-24.htm">Isaiah 3:24</a>. The sense here is, that Christian females are not to imitate those of the world in their careful attention to the ornaments of the head. It cannot be supposed that the mere braiding of the hair is forbidden, but only that careful attention to the manner of doing it, and to the ornaments usually worn in it, which characterized worldly females.<p>Or gold, or pearls - It is not to be supposed that all use of gold or pearls as articles of dress is here forbidden; but the idea is, that the Christian female is not to seek these as the adorning which she desires, or is not to imitate the world in these personal decorations. It may be a difficult question to settle how much ornament is allowable, and when the true line is passed. But though this cannot be settled by any exact rules, since much must depend on age, and on the relative rank in life, and the means which one may possess, yet there is one general rule which is applicable to all, and which might regulate all. It is, that the true line is passed when more is thought of this external adorning, than of the ornament of the heart. Any external decoration which occupies the mind more than the virtues of the heart, and which engrosses the time and attention more, we may be certain is wrong. The apparel should be such as not to attract attention; such as becomes our situation; such as will not be particularly singular; such as shall leave the impression that the heart is not fixed on it. It is a poor ambition to decorate a dying body with gold and pearls. It should not be forgotten that the body thus adorned will soon need other habiliments, and will occupy a position where gold and pearls would be a mockery. When the heart is right; when there is true and supreme love for religion, it is usually not difficult to regulate the subject of dress.<p>Costly array - Expensive dress. This is forbidden - for it is foolish, and the money thus employed may be much more profitably used in doing good. "Costly array" includes that which can be ill afforded, and that which is inconsistent with the feeling that the principle ornament is that of the heart. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9, 10. The context requires that we understand these directions as to women, in relation to their deportment in public worship, though the rules will hold good on other occasions also.<p>in modest apparel&#8212;"in seemly guise" [Ellicott]. The adjective means properly. orderly, decorous, becoming; the noun in secular writings means conduct, bearing. But here "apparel." Women are apt to love fine dress; and at Ephesus the riches of some (1Ti 6:17) would lead them to dress luxuriously. The Greek in Tit 2:3 is a more general term meaning "deportment."<p>shamefacedness&#8212;Trench spells this word according to its true derivation, "shamefastness" (that which is made fast by an honorable shame); as "steadfastness" (compare 1Ti 2:11, 12).<p>sobriety&#8212;"self-restraint" [Alford]. Habitual inner self-government [Trench]. I prefer Ellicott's translation, "sober-mindedness": the well-balanced state of mind arising from habitual self-restraint.<p>with&#8212;Greek, "in."<p>braided hair&#8212;literally, "plaits," that is, plaited hair: probably with the "gold and pearls" intertwined (1Pe 3:3). Such gaud is characteristic of the spiritual harlot (Re 17:4).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The apostle’s next precept to be urged by Timothy, is concerning the habits of women, especially when they come to worship God in the public assemblies; for to such assemblies the precepts in this chapter, both before and after this, chiefly relate. Concerning these he commands, that they should <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">adorn themselves in modest apparel, </span> observe a decency, with respect to the modesty of their sex, the purity of religion, the quality of their condition, and their age. Religion has no other interest in our habits, but to regulate them according to a modest comeliness; for they are indifferent in their nature, and neither add nor detract from the acceptance of our religious services. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shamefacedness and sobriety, </span> or modesty; a moderation of mind showed both in the habit of the body, and the manners and behaviour, both with these inward habits, and in an outward habit that may speak souls possessed of these inward habits. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; </span> not with hair platted or curled, not adorned with ornaments of gold, or pearls, or costly array. The apostle condemneth not these ornaments where they are suited to the quality of women, and ask not too much time to put on, and in order; but where they are too excessive with respect to the purse of those that wear them, or take up more time to be spent in putting them on than is fit to be so spent, especially on a sabbath day, or where they are put on out of pride, or to make a vain show, or are of that nature and fashion as they speak an unchaste or an immodest heart, or may cause scandal to others. The apostle Peter, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm" title="Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;">1 Peter 3:3</a></span>, hath much the same precept, where he is not speaking of women’s habits, with such special reference to public assemblies, but to their ordinary conversation; but it ought to be more specially avoided when people come to worship God. They should not so habit themselves when they go to pray, as if they were going to a dancing school, as Chrysostom in his time complained of some that did. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>In like manner also,.... Let the women pray likewise; though they are not to lead in prayer, or be the mouth of the church, which would be indecent, yet they are to join with the church in public prayer; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-14.htm">Acts 1:14</a> and in like manner as the men, with purity of heart and hand, without murmuring and impatience towards God, and without wrath and anger towards others, and in faith, without doubting and distrust: and the apostle proceeds to point out what sort of dress he would have them appear in at the time of prayer, and at any part of public worship; and thus the Ethiopic version renders it, "so let the women be clothed in prayer", namely, as follows; <p>that women adorn themselves in modest apparel: the word rendered "apparel" signifies a long robe, which reaches down to the feet; and the word translated "modest" signifies that which is clean, neat, and decent, yea, beautiful and ornamental; and the sense of the apostle is, that he would not have them to come to public worship in rags, and in dirty and filthy garments, but that their bodies should be covered with clean and decent raiment; so the Israelites washed their clothes that they might be ready to meet the Lord at Mount Sinai, <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-14.htm">Exodus 19:14</a>. The Jews always appeared in their best clothes on the sabbath day; this is one of their rules: (n). <p>"for the honour of the sabbath, every man must be clothed, , "with clean or neat apparel" and clothing on the weekday must not be as clothing on the sabbath day; and if a man can make no change, he must let down his talith (or upper garment, his cloak); so that his clothing may not be as the clothing of the weekdays, when that was girt up about him.'' <p>The apostle adds, <p>with shamefacedness and sobriety: these are the two general rules by which dress is to be regulated; it is right and proper, when it is consistent with chastity, when it is not immodest and impudent, and more like the attire of an harlot than of a woman professing godliness; and when it is moderate as well as modest, and suitable to a person's age and station, and is not beyond the circumstances of life in which they are. There is no religion or irreligion in dress, provided pride and luxury are guarded against, and modesty and moderation preserved. <p>Not with broidered hair, or plaited, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>; see Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-3.htm">1 Peter 3:3</a>. The Jews had women on purpose for this business; Mary Magdalene is thought to have her name from hence; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/27-56.htm">Matthew 27:56</a>. Or gold, or pearls, or costly array: not that the apostle forbids all use or wear of such things by proper persons, whose circumstances would admit of it, and upon proper occasions, and at proper times: certain it is, that earrings and bracelets of gold, and jewels set in silver and gold, and raiment, costly raiment, were sent by Abraham, and given to Rebekah, and wore by her, who was a woman professing godliness so the church in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/45-9.htm">Psalm 45:9</a> though in figurative expressions, yet in allusion to what is literal, and honourable, and commendable, is said to be in gold of Ophir, and her clothing to be of wrought gold, and to be brought to the king in raiment of needlework: but however justifiable such a dress may be at other seasons, the apostle judged it very improper at the time of public prayer, or at the time of public worship; seeing it might swell the heart of the wearer with pride, so as to forget herself and the business she was come about, and draw the eyes of others upon her; and so cause a general inattention. It was a complaint of Chrysostom's many hundreds of years ago, that some who came to public worship, appeared in such a dress, as if they came rather to dance than to pray; such apparel should be avoided: it is said of Pythagoras (o), that he taught the inhabitants of Crotona, the men literature, and the women chastity and modesty; and by his disputations so far prevailed upon the latter, as to lay aside their garments of gold and other ornaments of their dignity, as instruments of luxury; all which they brought into the temple of Juno, and dedicated them to that goddess; declaring, that shamefacedness or chastity, and not garments, are the true ornaments of matrons. <p>(n) Maimon.

Several expositors, however, connect it not only with <span class="greekheb">βούλομαι</span>, but also with <span class="greekheb">βούλομαι προσεύχεσθαι</span>: “I will that the men pray … so also the women;” they then take what follows: <span class="greekheb">ἐν καταστολῇ κοσμίῳ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., as corresponding to <span class="greekheb">ἐπαίροντας κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1 Timothy 2:8</a>, and as defining more precisely the manner in which the women are to pray. The infinitive <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span>, however, is against this construction. De Wette, indeed, thinks that it is added to the infinitive <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> by asyndeton; but although the connection of <span class="ital">several</span> infinitives with one another asyndetically frequently occurs (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-14.htm" title="I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house, give none occasion to the adversary to speak reproachfully.">1 Timothy 5:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-18.htm" title="That they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;">1 Timothy 6:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/titus/3-1.htm" title="Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,...">Titus 3:1-2</a>), there is no example of <span class="ital">two</span> infinitives being thus connected.[98] Hofmann is forced to assume that <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span> “is a consequence dependent on <span class="greekheb">μετὰ αἰδοῦς καὶ σωφροσύνης</span>;” but how can self-adorning be considered a consequence of “modesty and good sense”? Though sometimes the infinitive does stand connected in such loose fashion with what precedes, it would be difficult to find an instance of such a connection as Hofmann here assumes.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Against that construction there is also this point: since in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-8.htm" title="I will therefore that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.">1 Timothy 2:8</a> <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> means prayer made by the men aloud in the church, here in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1 Timothy 2:9</a> it would have to be taken in a weakened sense; and it is so rendered by de Wette and Hofmann: “taking part in prayer.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>According to this, the verse cannot be dependent on <span class="greekheb">βούλομαι προσεύχεσθαι</span>, but on <span class="greekheb">βούλομαι</span> alone, so that <span class="greekheb">ἐν καταστολῇ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. merely states how the women are to adorn themselves (so, too, Plitt). De Wette, indeed, thinks that objection may be made to this construction because the affirmative <span class="greekheb">ἐν κατ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is followed not only by a negative <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐν πλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., but also by a second affirmative in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-10.htm" title="But (which becomes women professing godliness) with good works.">1 Timothy 2:10</a>.

Nor is the particle <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span> an argument against us, since it stands in other places where the same predicates are not used (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-8.htm" title="Likewise must the deacons be grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre;">1 Timothy 3:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>). <span class="greekheb">Ὡσαύτως</span> may be used wherever the members to be connected contain something not exactly alike, but of a kindred nature, as is the case here with <span class="greekheb">ὁσίους</span> … <span class="greekheb">διαλογισμοῦ</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἐν καταστολῇ</span> … <span class="greekheb">σωφροσύνης</span>.[99] Nothing is to take place in the church, neither among the men nor among the women, which can hurt its spiritual dignity.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΚΑΤΑΣΤΟΛῇ ΚΟΣΜΊῼ</span>] <span class="greekheb">ΚΑΤΑΣΤΟΛΉ</span></span></span> may, according to Greek usage, denote “sedateness of nature.”[100] Hence it is that some expositors (de Wette among others) take it here as equivalent to <span class="ital">habitus</span>, <span class="greekheb">κατάστημα</span> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>); but it never occurs in that sense. The words that follow: <span class="greekheb">μὴ ἐν πλέγμασιν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ἱματισμῷ πολυτελεῖ</span>, show that the word is to be understood of clothing. True, it does not originally mean this, but the letting down, <span class="ital">e.g.</span>, of the <span class="greekheb">περιβολή</span> (Plutarch, <span class="ital">Pericl.</span> 5). This meaning, however, might easily pass into that of “the garment hanging down,” and then further, into that of “clothing in general.” This is the explanation given here by most expositors (also by Plitt and Hofmann; van Oosterzee translates it: “bearing,” but explains it afterwards: “<span class="greekheb">καταστολή</span> = <span class="greekheb">ἔνδυμα</span>”). Some take it quite generally; others, again, understand it of the garment enveloping the whole body (Chrysostom: <span class="greekheb">ἡ ἀμπεχόνη πάντοθεν περιστέλλουσα καλῶς</span>, <span class="greekheb">μὴ περιέργως</span>). This last explanation has no sufficient support in the etymology, nor in the ordinary usage.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">κόσμιος</span>] does not mean “delicately” (Luther), but “<span class="ital">modestly, honourably</span>” (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm" title="A bishop then must be blameless, the husband of one wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality, apt to teach;">1 Timothy 3:2</a>); beyond these passages, it is not found in the N.

T. p. 171]) refer <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν</span> to <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span>, and take <span class="greekheb">ἃ πρέπει</span> … <span class="greekheb">θεοσέβειαν</span> as a parenthesis.[102] But there are three points against this, viz., that the ornament of the women is already named in <span class="greekheb">ἐν καταστολῇ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>., that the preposition <span class="greekheb">διά</span> does not suit with <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span> (which is construed previously with <span class="greekheb">ἐν</span>), and that “good works” would be unsuitably described as ornament here, where he is speaking of the conduct of the women in the assemblies of the church, unless we arbitrarily limit the general idea to offerings for the poor, as is done by Heydenreich and van Oosterzee. Theodoret rightly joins <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἐργ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀγ</span>. with the immediately preceding <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελλ</span>. <span class="greekheb">θεοσεβ</span>. (“<span class="greekheb">εὐσέβειαν ἐπαγγέλλεσθε</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὴν διʼ ἔργων ἀρετήν</span>”); so, too, Oecumenius, Luther, Calvin, etc.; and among more recent names, Mack, Matthies, and Plitt. The comma before <span class="greekheb">διά</span>, which is found in the editions, must therefore be deleted. Hofmann connects the words with what follows, taking <span class="greekheb">διά</span> in the sense of accompanying; but <span class="greekheb">διά</span> never has such a simple copulative meaning.[103]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The relative <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> stands here either for <span class="greekheb">ἐν τούτῳ ὅ</span>, for which Matthies appeals, but wrongly, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/6-21.htm" title="What fruit had you then in those things whereof you are now ashamed? for the end of those things is death.">Romans 6:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-14.htm" title="How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher?">Romans 10:14</a>; or more probably for <span class="greekheb">καθʼ ὅ</span>. So far as the meaning goes, the various reading <span class="greekheb">ὡς</span> (<span class="greekheb">καθώς</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/5-3.htm" title="But fornication, and all uncleanness, or covetousness, let it not be once named among you, as becomes saints;">Ephesians 5:3</a>) is correct. Hofmann wishes to refer <span class="greekheb">ὅ</span> to <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν ἑαυτάς</span> in such a way that “the latter is mentioned as a thing … seemly for women.” The intervening <span class="greekheb">ἀλλά</span>, however, manifestly makes this construction impossible.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγελλομέναις θεοσέβειαν</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐπαγγέλλεσθαι</span> usually means in the N. T. “promise.” Matthies accordingly renders the word here by “give information, show;” so, too, Luther: “who therein manifest blessedness.” But it is more correct here to take the word in the sense in which <span class="ital">profiteri artem</span> is used, so that <span class="greekheb">θεοσέβεια</span> is regarded as an art or a handicraft. De Wette rightly says: “who make profession of blessedness;” so, too, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/6-21.htm" title="Which some professing have erred concerning the faith.

The addition of these words is fully explained by a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-5.htm" title="Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away.">2 Timothy 3:5</a>. Calvin gives the connection with the preceding words rightly: si operibus testanda est pietas, in vestitu etiam casto apparere haec professio debet.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[98] Wiesinger unites the <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span> with the <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span>, and defends it with the remark, that if instead of the asyndeton of the infinitive <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span> we had the participle, there could have been no doubt regarding it. Then he asks: “Have we not elsewhere examples enough of a similar change of construction?” To this we must answer, “No,” unless “similar” be taken in too wide a sense.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[99] It is necessary therefore to do, as van Oosterzee does, supply the participle <span class="greekheb">προσευχομένας</span> with <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span> because of the <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[100] In this sense the word is found, <span class="ital">e.g.</span> in Arrian (<span class="ital">Epict.</span> ii. 10), joined with <span class="greekheb">αἰδώς</span> and <span class="greekheb">ἡμερότης</span>.—In the passage of Josephus, <span class="ital">B. J.</span> ii. 8. 4 : <span class="greekheb">καταστολὴ δὲ καὶ σχῆμα σώματος ὅμοιον τοῖς μετὰ φόβου παιδαγωγουμένοις παισίν</span>, which is commonly quoted as a proof of the meaning “clothing,” the meaning is doubtful. Salmasius explains it: sedatus animus et remissus, elato et superbo tumentique oppositus, in contrast with <span class="greekheb">ὀργῆς</span>, ver. 8; but in that case the added adjective <span class="greekheb">κόσμιος</span> is superfluous.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[101] The two words are also placed together elsewhere as feminine virtues. See Raphelius, who quotes, among others, the passage from Epictetus (<span class="ital">Enchir.</span> chap. 62): mulieres in ornatu spem collocant omnem; quare operae pretium est, dare operam, ut sentiant, sibi non ob aliud honorem haberi, <span class="greekheb">ἢ τῷ κοσμίαι φαίνεσθαι</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ αἰδήμονες ἐν σωφροσύνῃ</span>. Although in the <span class="ital">Cyropaedia</span> (Book viii.) the two words are thus distinguished: <span class="greekheb">διῄρει</span> (<span class="ital">sc</span>. Cyrus) <span class="greekheb">δὲ αἰδὼ καὶ σωφροσύνκν τῇδε</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς τοὺς μὲν αἰδουμένους</span>, <span class="greekheb">τὰ ἐν τῷ φανερῷ αἰσχρὰ φεύγοντας</span>, <span class="greekheb">τοὺς δὲ σώφρονας</span>, <span class="greekheb">καὶ τὰ ἐν τῷ ἀφανεῖ</span>, the distinction cannot be regarded as always valid.—Aristotle (<span class="ital">Rhet.</span> i. 9) explains <span class="greekheb">σωφροσύνη</span> in the following fashion: <span class="greekheb">σωφροσύνη ἀρετή</span>, <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἣν πρὸς τὰς ἡδονὰς τοῦ σώματος οὕτως ἔχουσιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὡς ὁ νόμος κελεύει</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[102] Van Oosterzee explains it as “a causal periphrasis to show why precisely <span class="ital">this</span> ornament is extolled by the apostle.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[103] Hofmann thus paraphrases the thought: “They are to do what is good, and to learn in still seclusion. The former is that which is to be accompanied by the latter.” He appeals to <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/2-4.htm" title="For out of much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you with many tears; not that you should be grieved, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly to you.">2 Corinthians 2:4</a>. He does not prove, however, that that passage justifies such a paraphrase. The relation between writing and tears is obviously quite different from that between learning in stillness and good works.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-9.htm" title="In like manner also, that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with modesty and sobriety; not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array;">1 Timothy 2:9</a>. Having assigned to the men the prominent duties of the Church, St. Paul proceeds to render impossible any misconception of his views on this subject by forbidding women to teach in public. But he begins by emphasising what is their characteristic and proper glory, the beauty of personality which results from active beneficence.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The essential parts of the sentence are <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως γυναῖκας</span> … <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν ἑαυτάς</span> … <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν</span>. Both <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> and <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν ἑσυτάς</span> depend on <span class="greekheb">βούλομαι</span>, as does <span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span>, which introduces another regulation laid down by the apostle. In the Christian Society, it was St. Paul’s deliberate wish that the men should conduct public worship, and that the women should adorn the Society and themselves by good works. This verse has no reference to the demeanour of women while in Church. It is inconsistent with the whole context to supply <span class="greekheb">προσεύχεσθαι</span> after <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The connexion of <span class="greekheb">ἐν καταστολῇ</span>—<span class="greekheb">σωφροσύνης</span> has been disputed. Ellicott takes it as “a kind of adjectival predication to be appended to <span class="greekheb">γυναῖκας</span>,” stating what is the normal condition of women, who are to superadd the adornment of good works. But it is more natural to connect it directly with <span class="greekheb">κοσμεῖν</span>, with which <span class="greekheb">ἐν πλέγμασιν</span>, <span class="greekheb">κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. is also connected as well as <span class="greekheb">διʼ ἔργων ἀγαθῶν</span>; the change of preposition being due to the distinction between the means employed for adornment and the resultant expression of it. The effect of the practice of good works is seen in an <span class="ital">orderly appearance</span>, etc.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ὡσαύτως</span> is a word of frequent occurrence in the Pastorals. See reff. Except in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/5-25.htm" title="Likewise also the good works of some are manifest beforehand; and they that are otherwise cannot be hid.">1 Timothy 5:25</a>, it is used as a connecting link between items in a series of regulations. The use of it in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/8-26.htm" title="Likewise the Spirit also helps our infirmities: for we know not what we should pray for as we ought: but the Spirit itself makes intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.">Romans 8:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-25.htm" title="After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is the new testament in my blood: this do you, as oft as you drink it, in remembrance of me.">1 Corinthians 11:25</a> is different.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καταστολή</span>, as Ellicott says, “conveys the idea of external appearance as <span class="ital">principally</span> exhibited in dress”. It is “<span class="ital">deportment</span>, as exhibited externally, whether in look manner or dress”. The commentators cite in illustration Josephus, <span class="ital">Bell. Jud</span>. ii. 8, 4, where the <span class="greekheb">καταστολὴ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">σχῆμα σώματος</span> of the Essenes is described in detail. The Latin <span class="ital">habitus</span> is a good rendering, if we do not restrict that term to dress, as the Vulg. here, <span class="ital">habitu ornato</span>, seems to do.

Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-3.htm" title="The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers of good things;">Titus 2:3</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">modest apparel</span>] Or, <span class="bld">seemly guise</span>, if we take the word (which occurs only here) to refer like the Latin <span class="ital">habitus</span> not solely to dress but also to demeanour.

Alford argues strongly in favor of the meaning "apparel." But it may also mean "steadiness" or "quietness" of demeanor; and then the phrase will be exactly parallel to <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_peter/3-5.htm">1 Peter 3:5</a>, "The incorruptible apparel of a meek and quiet spirit." And the meaning will be, "Let Christian women adorn themselves with a decent and well-ordered quietness of demeanor, in strict accordance with [or, 'together with'] shame-fastness and sobriety [<span class="greek">&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x1f71;</span>, 'in strict accord with,' or 'together with'] not with braided hair," etc. A woman's true ornament is not the finery which sire gets from the milliner, but the chaste discretion which she has from the Spirit of God. <span class="cmt_word">Modest</span> (<span class="greek">&#x3ba;&#x1f79;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</span>); only found in the New Testament here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-2.htm">1 Timothy 3:2</a>, where it is rendered" of good behavior" in the A.V., and "modest" in the margin, "orderly" in the R.V.

In earlier Greek, as in Homer, it sometimes blends with the sense of &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; shame, though used also of the feeling of respectful timidity in the presence of superiors, or of penitent respect toward one who has been wronged (see Homer, Il. i. 23). Hence it is connected in Homer with military discipline (Il. v. 531). It is the feeling of a suppliant or an unfortunate in the presence of those from whom he seeks aid; of a younger man toward an older and wiser one. It is a feeling based upon the sense of deficiency, inferiority, or unworthiness. On the other hand, it is the feeling of a superior in position or fortune which goes out to an unfortunate. See Homer, Il. xxiv. 208; Od. xiv. 388; Soph. Oed. Col. 247. In the Attic period, a distinction was recognised between &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; and &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2;: &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; representing a respectful and reverent attitude toward another, while &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; was the sense of shame on account of wrong doing. Thus, "one &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is respectful to his father, but &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; is ashamed because he has been drunk." Trench (N.T. Synon.  xix.) remarks that "&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3b4;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c2; is the nobler word and implies the nobler motive. In it is involved an innate moral repugnance to the doing of the dishonorable act, which moral repugnance scarcely or not at all exists in the &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;. Let the man who is restrained by &#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; alone be insured against the outward disgrace which he fears his act will entail, and he will refrain from it no longer." The A.V. shamefacedness is a corruption of the old English shamefastness. So Chaucer:<p>"Schamefast chastite."<p>Knight's T. 2057.<p>Shakespeare:<p>"'Tis a blushing shamefast spirit that mutinies in a man's bosom."<p>Richard III. i. 4.<p>It is one of a large class of words, as steadfast, soothfast, rootfast, masterfast, handfast, bedfast, etc. Shamefaced changes and destroys the original force of the word, which was bound or made fast by an honorable shame. &#x3a3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; sobrietys oP. Once in Acts, <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/26-25.htm">Acts 26:25</a>. The kindred verb &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd; to be of sound mind, <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/12-3.htm">Romans 12:3-5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/5-13.htm">2 Corinthians 5:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-6.htm">Titus 2:6</a>. Several representatives of this family of words appear in the Pastorals, and with the exception of &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; and &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3bd;, nowhere else in N.T.

The word is compounded of &#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; or &#x3c3;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2; safe, sound, and &#x3c6;&#x3c1;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; mind. It signifies entire command of the passions and desires; a self-control which holds the rein over these. So Aristotle (Rhet. i.:9): The virtue by which we hold ourselves toward the pleasures of the body as. the law enjoins." Comp. 4 Macc. 1:31. Euripides calls it "the fairest gift of the gods" (Med. 632). That it appears so rarely in N.T. is, as Trench remarks, "not because more value was attached to it in heathen ethics than in Christian morality, but because it is taken up and transformed into a condition yet higher still, in which a man does not command himself, which is well, but, which is better still, is commanded by God." The words with shamefastness and sobriety may either be taken directly with adorn themselves, or better perhaps, as indicating moral qualities accompanying (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#768; with) the modest apparel. Let them adorn themselves in modest apparel, having along with this shamefastness and sobermindedness.<p>continued...</body></html>
