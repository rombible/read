The argument here is a singular one—Adam and Eve both sinned, but Adam was not deceived. He sinned, quite aware all the while of the magnitude of the sin he was voluntarily committing. Eve, on the other hand, was completely, thoroughly deceived (the preposition with which the Greek verb is compounded here conveying the idea of thoroughness)—she succumbed to the serpent’s deceit. Both were involved in the sin, but only one (Eve) allowed herself to be deluded. So Bengel, “<span class= "ital">Deceptio indicat minus robur in intellectu, atque hic nervus est cur mulieri non liceat docere.”</span> Prof. Reynolds thus comments on the argument of the Apostle:—“This may sound to our ears a far-fetched argument, when used to discountenance female usurpation of intellectual supremacy. It was, however, a method current at the time to look for and find in the Scriptures the concrete expressions of almost all philosophical judgments. At the present day we could hardly find a more vivid illustration of the essential difference between the masculine and feminine nature. If there be this distinction between the sexes, that distinction still furnishes the basis of an argument and a reason for the advice here rendered. The catastrophe of Eden is the beacon for all generations when the sexes repeat the folly of Eve and Adam, and exchange their distinctive position and functions.”<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>2:8-15 Under the gospel, prayer is not to be confined to any one particular house of prayer, but men must pray every where. We must pray in our closets, pray in our families, pray at our meals, pray when we are on journeys, and pray in the solemn assemblies, whether more public or private. We must pray in charity; without wrath, or malice, or anger at any person. We must pray in faith, without doubting, and without disputing. Women who profess the Christian religion, must be modest in apparel, not affecting gaudiness, gaiety, or costliness. Good works are the best ornament; these are, in the sight of God, of great price. Modesty and neatness are more to be consulted in garments than elegance and fashion. And it would be well if the professors of serious godliness were wholly free from vanity in dress. They should spend more time and money in relieving the sick and distressed, than in decorating themselves and their children. To do this in a manner unsuitable to their rank in life, and their profession of godliness, is sinful. These are not trifles, but Divine commands. The best ornaments for professors of godliness, are good works. According to St. Paul, women are not allowed to be public teachers in the church; for teaching is an office of authority. But good women may and ought to teach their children at home the principles of true religion. Also, women must not think themselves excused from learning what is necessary to salvation, though they must not usurp authority. As woman was last in the creation, which is one reason for her subjection, so she was first in the transgression. But there is a word of comfort; that those who continue in sobriety, shall be saved in child-bearing, or with child-bearing, by the Messiah, who was born of a woman. And the especial sorrow to which the female sex is subject, should cause men to exercise their authority with much gentleness, tenderness, and affection.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>And Adam was not deceived - This is the second reason why the woman should occupy a subordinate rank in all things. It is, that in the most important situation in which she was ever placed she had shown that she was not qualified to take the lead. She had evinced a readiness to yield to temptation; a feebleness of resistance; a pliancy of character, which showed that she was not adapted to the situation of headship, and which made it proper that she should ever afterward occupy a subordinate situation. It is not meant here that Adam did not sin, nor even that he was not deceived by the tempter, but that the woman opposed a feebler resistance to the temptation than he would have done, and that the temptation as actually applied to her would have been ineffectual on him. To tempt and seduce him to fall, there were needed all the soft persuasions, the entreaties, and example of his wife.<p>Satan understood this, and approached man not with the specious argument of the serpent, but through the allurements of his wife. It is undoubtedly implied here that man in general has a power of resisting certain kinds of temptation superior to that possessed by woman, and hence that the headship properly belongs to him. This is, undoubtedly, the general truth, though there may be many exceptions, and many noble cases to the honor of the female sex, in which they evince a power of resistance to temptation superior to man. In many traits of character, and among them those which are most lovely, woman is superior to man; yet it is undoubtedly true that, as a general thing, temptation will make a stronger impression on her than on him. When it is said that "Adam was not deceived," it is not meant that when he partook actually of the fruit he was under no deception, but that he was not deceived by the serpent; he was not first deceived, or first in the transgression. The woman should remember that sin began with her, and she should therefore be willing to occupy an humble and subordinate situation.<p>But the woman being deceived - She was made to suppose that the fruit would not injure her, but would make her wise, and that God would not fulfil his threatening of death. Sin, from the beginning, has been a process of delusion. Every man or woman who violates the law of God is deceived as to the happiness which is expected from the violation, and as to the consequences which will follow it. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. Adam was not deceived&#8212;as Eve was deceived by the serpent; but was persuaded by his wife. Ge 3:17, "hearkened unto &#8230; voice of &#8230; wife." But in Ge 3:13, Eve says, "The serpent beguiled me." Being more easily deceived, she more easily deceives [Bengel], (2Co 11:3). Last in being, she was first in sin&#8212;indeed, she alone was deceived. The subtle serpent knew that she was "the weaker vessel" (1Pe 3:7). He therefore tempted her, not Adam. She yielded to the temptations of sense and the deceits of Satan; he, to conjugal love. Hence, in the order of God's judicial sentence, the serpent, the prime offender, stands first; the woman, who was deceived, next; and the man, persuaded by his wife, last (Ge 3:14-19). In Ro 5:12, Adam is represented as the first transgressor; but there no reference is made to Eve, and Adam is regarded as the head of the sinning race. Hence, as here, 1Ti 2:11, in Ge 3:16, woman's "subjection" is represented as the consequence of her being deceived.<p>being deceived&#8212;The oldest manuscripts read the compound Greek verb for the simple, "Having been seduced by deceit": implying how completely Satan succeeded in deceiving her.<p>was in the transgression&#8212;Greek, "came to be in the transgression": became involved in the existing state of transgression, literally, "the going beyond a command"; breach of a positive precept (Ro 4:15).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Besides, Adam was not first deceived, nor indeed at all deceived immediately by the serpent, but only enticed, and deceived by the woman, who was the tempter’s agent; so as that she was both first in the transgression in order of time, and also principal in it, contributing to the seduction or transgression of the man; which ought to be a consideration to keep the woman humble, in a low opinion of herself, and that lower order wherein God hath fixed her. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And Adam was not deceived,.... There is no need to say with interpreters, that he was not deceived first; and that he was not deceived immediately by the serpent, but by Eve; and that he is never said in Scripture to be deceived, as Melchizedek is never said to have a father or mother. The apostle's positive assertion is to be taken without any such limitations or qualifications; Adam never was deceived at all; neither by the serpent, with whom he never conversed; nor by his wife, he knew what he did, when he took the fruit of her, and ate; he ate it not under any deception, or vain imagination, that they should not die, but should be as gods, knowing good and evil. He took and ate out of love to his wife, from a fond affection to her, to bear her company, and that she might not die alone; he knew what he did, and he knew what would be the consequence of it, the death of them both; and inasmuch as he sinned wilfully, and against light and knowledge, without any deception, his sin was the greater: and hereby death came in, and passed on all men, who sinned in him: <p>but the woman being deceived was in the transgression: and the serpent really beguiled her; she owned it herself, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-13.htm">Genesis 3:13</a>. And this is elsewhere said of her, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm">2 Corinthians 11:3</a> which never is of Adam. She really thought the serpent spoke truth, that she and her husband should not die, if they ate of the fruit; but that it was good to make them wise; and that, upon eating it, they should be as gods, knowing good and evil; and under this deception she fell into the transgression, and was the cause and means, by her persuasions and example, of bringing her husband into the same sin; which involved him and all his posterity in ruin and destruction. And therefore she is called by the Jews (p) , "the mother of iniquity and sin"; to which they refer, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/51-5.htm">Psalm 51:5</a>. And they say, (q) she was the cause of death to Adam, and to all the world: See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm">Romans 5:12</a>. And they observe (r) the order of the punishment of the serpent, Eve, and Adam, as of their sin; the serpent was first accursed, then Eve, and last of all Adam. They say <p>"(s) Samael (the devil) could not subvert Adam, till the serpent came and turned the heart of Eve, and Eve turned his heart, and they both sinned; wherefore it is said, "the woman which thou gavest me"; Samael had no power to turn him, till Eve came, and she was the cause of his eating.'' <p>Now inasmuch as the serpent did not attack Adam, he being the stronger and more knowing person, and less capable of being managed and seduced; but made his attempt on Eve, in which he succeeded; and since not Adam, but Eve, was deceived, it appears that the man is the more proper person to bear rule and authority, as in civil and domestic, so in ecclesiastic affairs; and it is right for the woman to learn, and the man to teach: and seeing that Eve was the cause of transgression to Adam, and of punishment to him and his posterity, the subjection of the woman to the man was confirmed afresh: and she was brought into a more depressed state of dependence on him, and subjection to him; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-16.htm">Genesis 3:16</a>.

So Theodoret; Tertullian, too (<span class="ital">De Hab. Mul.</span>), says, perhaps alluding to this passage: tu divinae legis prima es desertrix. Others, again, supply <span class="greekheb">ὑπὸ τοῦ ὄφεως</span> (Matthies: “As the apostle remembers the O. T. story of the fall, there comes into his thoughts the cunning serpent by which Eve, not Adam, let herself be ensnared”). De Wette thinks that the author is insisting on the notion <span class="ital">be charmed, betrayed</span> (by sinful desire), as opposed to some other motive to sin. Hofmann arbitrarily supplies with <span class="greekheb">Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη</span> the thought: “so long as he was alone.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The apparent difficulty is solved when we remember the peculiarity of allegorical interpretation, which lays stress on the definite expression as such. This here is the word <span class="greekheb">ἀπατᾷν</span> (or <span class="greekheb">ἐξαπατᾷν</span>). On this word the whole emphasis is laid, as is clearly shown by the very repetition of it. This word, however, in the Mosaic account of the fall, is used only of the woman, not of the man, for in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-13.htm" title="And the LORD God said to the woman, What is this that you have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat.">Genesis 3:13</a> the woman expressly says: <span class="greekheb">ὁ ὄφις ἠπάτησέ με</span>; the man, however, uses no such expression. And in the story there is no indication that as the woman was deceived or betrayed through the promises of the serpent, so was the man through the woman.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Adam did certainly also transgress the command, but not, as the woman, influenced by <span class="greekheb">ἀπάτη</span>. Paul, remembering this, says: <span class="greekheb">Ἀδὰμ οὐκ ἠπατήθη</span>, <span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα</span>. Bengel: serpens mulierem decepit, mulier virum non decepit, sed ei persuasit. To supply anything whatever, only serves therefore to conceal the apostle’s real meaning.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">ἡ δὲ γυνὴ ἐξαπατηθεῖσα ἐν παραβάσει γέγονε</span>] This betrayal of the woman by the serpent is mentioned by Paul also in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/11-3.htm" title="But I fear, lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.">2 Corinthians 11:3</a>, where he employs the same word: <span class="greekheb">ἐξαπατᾷν</span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The emphasis, as is apparent from what precedes, is not on the last words, but on <span class="greekheb">ἐξαπατηθεῖσα</span>; hence it is not right to supply <span class="greekheb">πρώτη</span> with <span class="greekheb">ἐν παρ</span>. <span class="greekheb">γεγ</span>. <span class="greekheb">Παράβασις</span> here, as elsewhere (<span class="greekheb">οὗ οὐκ ἔστι νόμος</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐδὲ παράβασις</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/4-15.htm" title="Because the law works wrath: for where no law is, there is no transgression.">Romans 4:15</a>), is used in regard to a definite law.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The construction <span class="greekheb">γεγονέναι ἐν</span> occurs frequently in the N. T. in order to denote the entrance into a certain condition, a certain existence. De Wette: “fell into transgression.” Luther wrongly: “and brought in transgression.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>As to the thought itself, expositors find the force of this second reason to lie in the fact that in the fall the weakness of the woman, her proneness to temptation, was manifested, and that consequently it is not seemly for the woman to have mastery over the man. But did the man resist the temptation more stoutly than the woman? Paul nowhere gives any hint of that. The significant part of the Mosaic narrative to him is rather this, that the judgment of God was passed upon the woman because she had let herself be <span class="ital">betrayed</span> by the serpent, and it is in accordance with this judgment that the husband is made lord over the wife.[107]<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[107] The right interpretation of this passage does not even in appearance contradict <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/5-12.htm" title="Why, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed on all men, for that all have sinned:">Romans 5:12</a>.
