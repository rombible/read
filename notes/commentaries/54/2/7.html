These fiery and earnest words had no private reference to <span class= "ital">him, </span>St. Paul, or to <span class= "ital">his</span> especial claims to be heard, but were uttered solely in view of the surpassing magnitude of the message with which he was charged—solely to bear a weighty and imposing testimony to the truth of his assertion, which so many were ready and eager to dispute—the assertion that the gospel of Jesus Christ was a message of glad tidings, was an offer of salvation, not to a <span class= "ital">people, </span>but to a <span class= "ital">world.</span><p><span class= "bld">A teacher of the Gentiles.</span>—This specifies more clearly the especial duties of his apostleship, not perhaps without some reference to the peculiar fitness which marked him out as the declarer of the divine will in respect to this gracious offer of redemption to the isles of the scattered countless Gentiles.<p><span class= "bld">In faith and verity.</span>—Better rendered, <span class= "ital">in faith and truth.</span> These words specify the sphere in which the Apostle performed his great mission.

Or, in other words, St. Paul carried on his ceaseless labours, <span class= "ital">within</span> gathering fresh and ever fresh strength from the exhaustless spring of his own loving, mighty faith in Jesus, and <span class= "ital">without</span> appealing to the generally well-known incidents of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, the truth of which all might test.

Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Whereunto - Greek, "Unto which;" that is, to the bearing of which testimony I am appointed.<p>I am ordained - Greek, "I am placed or constituted" -  &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd;  etethe&#772;n.

He was ordained or appointed to be a preacher of the Gospel from all eternity, and was separated or set apart unto it in time, and was put into the ministry of it by Christ himself, and was not a common or ordinary preacher of the word, but an apostle, an extraordinary officer in the Gospel church. <p>I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not; which are a sort of an oath, or an appeal to Christ the omniscient God, for the truth of what he said, concerning his ordination to the Gospel; see a like phrase in <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm">Romans 9:1</a>. The phrase, "in Christ", is left out in the Alexandrian copy, and in three of Beza's ancient copies, and in some others, and in the Vulgate Latin, Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions; <p>a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity; the Gospel of the uncircumcision, or which was to be preached to the uncircumcised Gentiles, was committed to this apostle; and his work and ministry lay among them, and therefore he is called the apostle of the Gentiles: and so he was in faith and verity; which may regard the subject matter of his teachings and ministry; it was the faith and truth of the Gospel, even the whole of it, the faith which was once delivered to the saints, and the truth as it is in Jesus; or else the character of the apostle, as a teacher, that he was a true and faithful one, who with all integrity and veracity, fully and faithfully preached the Gospel; and since he was appointed a teacher of it to the Gentiles, this is another argument why they, as well as the Jews, should be prayed for. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, <i>and</i> lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in <span class="cverse3">{c}</span> faith and verity.</span><p>(c) Faithfully and sincerely: and by faith he means wholesome and sound doctrine, and by truth, an upright and sincere handling of it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm" title="Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.">1 Timothy 2:7</a>.

In order to direct attention to his peculiar apostolic authority, Paul adds to the general idea of <span class="greekheb">κήρυξ</span>, the more specific expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολος</span>. By the addition of <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθειαν λέγω</span>, <span class="greekheb">οὐ ψεύδομαι</span>, the truth of the <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὅ</span> is confirmed;[95] he explains himself sufficiently on account of the heretics who wished that Paul should not be considered an apostle by the appointment of God.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The further definition: <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔΆΣΚΑΛΟς ἘΘΝῶΝ</span></span></span>, is to be taken in apposition to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΚΉΡΥΞ Κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΠΌΣΤΟΛΟς</span></span></span>. It was added to make clearer the reference to the heathen already indicated in <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΕἸς Ὅ</span></span></span>, not, as Hofmann thinks, to form an apposition to the subject of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἈΛΉΘΕΙΑΝ ΛΈΓΩ</span></span></span>; had that been so, we should have had an emphatic <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΓΏ</span></span></span>. The connected words <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ ΚΑῚ ἈΛΗΘΕΊᾼ</span></span></span> do not form the object of <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΔΙΔ</span></span></span>. (Heydenreich takes it as “equivalent to <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ Τῇ ἈΛΗΘΙΝῇ</span></span></span>, a teacher of the Gentiles who is to instruct them in the true religion”); they are loosely added, according to a common usage of the N. T., and denote here the sphere in which he was appointed to discharge his office as teacher of the Gentiles. The peculiar point of view must not be lost by arbitrarily changing the words into <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἘΝ Τῇ ΠΊΣΤΕΙ Τ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἈΛΗΘΙΝῇ</span></span></span>, or, as Leo does, into <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ΠΙΣΤῸς ΚΑῚ ἈΛΗΘΙΝΌς</span></span></span>.

Otto (p. 117) unjustifiably uses this asseveration of the apostle to confirm his assertion that the epistle was written during the apostle’s stay at Ephesus, insisting that Paul, after he was put in prison in Jerusalem, was acknowledged an apostle in all Christian churches, and from that time, therefore, had no occasion for this asseveration. Apart from other points, Otto errs in referring the words <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθειαν κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. only to the expression <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολος</span>, whereas they apply to the entire thought in <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. Paul does not make asseveration that he was appointed an apostle, but that he was appointed an apostle of the <span class="greekheb">μαρτύριον</span>, the subject of which he had already mentioned. Comp. on this the passages quoted above.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>[96] Bengel seems to take the words in a sense corresponding to the formula of asseveration, <span class="greekheb">ἀληθ</span>. <span class="greekheb">λέγω κ</span>.<span class="greekheb">τ</span>.<span class="greekheb">λ</span>. He says in regard to this formula: “pertinet haec affirmatio ad comma praecedens; nam subsequenti additur parallela: <span class="greekheb">ἐν π</span>. <span class="greekheb">καὶ ἀληθ</span>.;” a view for which there is no justification.—Matthies expresses himself somewhat obscurely; for while he in the first place mentions faith and truth not only as the elements, but also as the aims of the teaching, he says at the end of the discussion: “The apostle is teacher of the Gentiles in such a way that he knows himself to be impregnably established thereby in faith and truth.”<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/egt/1_timothy/2.htm">Expositor's Greek Testament</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-7.htm" title="Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle, (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not;) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.">1 Timothy 2:7</a>. <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ</span>: scil. <span class="greekheb">τὸ μαρτύριον</span>, or <span class="greekheb">τὸ εὐαγγέλιον</span>, as in the parallel passage, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm" title="Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.">2 Timothy 1:11</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The phrase <span class="greekheb">εἰς ὃ ἐτέθην ἐγὼ κῆρυξ κ</span>. <span class="greekheb">ἀπόστολος</span> [<span class="greekheb">καὶ</span>] <span class="greekheb">διδάσκαλος</span> is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_timothy/1-11.htm" title="Whereunto I am appointed a preacher, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles.">2 Timothy 1:11</a>, as <span class="greekheb">ἀλήθειαν</span> … <span class="greekheb">ψεύδομαι</span> occurs again <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/9-1.htm" title="I say the truth in Christ, I lie not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost,">Romans 9:1</a>; but there we have the significant addition [<span class="greekheb">λέγω</span>] <span class="greekheb">ἐν Χριστῷ</span>.

It combines the idea of authority in the preacher who is the authorized herald (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-15.htm">Romans 10:15</a>), and publicity for his message (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/10-27.htm">Matthew 10:27</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/12-3.htm">Luke 12:3</a>). <span class="cmt_word">I speak the truth</span>, etc. The reason for this strong asseveration of his office as the apostle of the Gentiles is not at first sight apparent. But it was probably made in view of the antagonism of the Judaizing teachers referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/1-3.htm">1 Timothy 1:3, 19, 20</a> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/11-13.htm">Romans 11:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/15-15.htm">Romans 15:15, 16</a>). <a name="vws" id="vws"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/vws/1_timothy/2.htm">Vincent's Word Studies</a></div>I am ordained (&#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3b3;&#x3c9;)<p>Better, I was appointed.

Paul does not use the noun, but the kindred verb &#x3ba;&#x3b7;&#x3c1;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3c3;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#x3bd; to proclaim or preach is very common in his writings. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/10-8.htm">Romans 10:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/1-23.htm">1 Corinthians 1:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/4-5.htm">2 Corinthians 4:5</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/philippians/1-15.htm">Philippians 1:15</a>, etc.<p>I speak the truth in Christ and lie not<p>Omit in Christ.

He expressly distinguishes between teacher and apostle. See <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-28.htm">1 Corinthians 12:28</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-11.htm">Ephesians 4:11</a>.

The combination only here. Paul has sincerity and truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/5-8.htm">1 Corinthians 5:8</a>), and sanctification of the Spirit and faith of the truth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_thessalonians/2-13.htm">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>). The phrase must not be explained in true faith, nor faithfully and truly. It means that faith and truth are the element or sphere in which the apostolic function is discharged: that he preaches with a sincere faith in the gospel, and with a truthful representation of the gospel which he believes. </body></html>
