Josephus especially mentions how a refusal on the part of the Jews to pray for Roman magistrates led to the great war with the empire which ended in their destruction as a separate nation.<p>A well-known passage in the <span class= "ital">Apology</span> of Tertullian, written about a century and a quarter after St. Paul sent his first letter to Timothy, shows how well and carefully this charge of the great teacher, written to the Church in Ephesus, was kept in distant Carthage:—“We Christians. . . . do intercede for all the emperors that their lives may be prolonged, their government be secured to them, that their families may be preserved in safety, their senates faithful to them, their armies brave, their people honest, and that the whole empire may be at peace, and for whatever other things are desired by the people or the Cæsar.”<p>Early in the second century, Polycarp of Smyrna bears similar testimony to this practice in the early Church of praying publicly for their heathen rulers:—“Pray for all the saints; pray, too, for all kings and powers and rulers, and for your persecutors, and those that hate you, and for your cruel enemies.”<p><span class= "bld">That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life.</span>—What now is the special object of this prayer for those in high authority and power? First, that through <span class= "ital">their</span> wise rule the Christians might enjoy peace; and, second, that the temper of the people who prayed thus for the ruling powers might be so affected the constant repetition of such prayers: that all thoughts of revolt and resistance would be gradually stamped out.<p>St. Paul knew whom he was addressing. The Christian congregations of his age were largely made up of Jews. An intense longing to throw off the yoke of Rome pervaded the whole nation. The terrible events of the year 70 (only four or five years at most from the time of writing this Epistle) show how deep-seated was their hatred of the stranger. No Christian, however, was implicated in that fatal rebellion; so thoroughly had the teaching of St. Paul and his fellow Apostles done its work among the Jewish followers of the Crucified.<p><span class= "bld">In all godliness and honesty.</span>—The word rendered “honesty” is better translated <span class= "ital">gravity, </span>or decorum. These words are only used by St. Paul in his Pastoral Epistles, where “godliness” occurs nine times, and “gravity” three times. The sphere, so to speak, in which St. Paul’s ideal Christian must walk during his quiet, unobtrusive pilgrimage, was reverence and decorum.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/1_timothy/2.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty....">1 Timothy 2:2-4</a>. </span><span class="ital">For kings </span>— Especially; <span class="ital">and for all that are in authority </span>— “That is, for the ministers and counsellors of kings, and for the inferior magistrates, by whatever name they may be called, seeing even the lowest country magistrates frequently do much good or much harm. In the early times the Jews prayed for the heathen princes, who held them in captivity, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/6-10.htm" title="That they may offer sacrifices of sweet smells to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.">Ezra 6:10</a>; <a href="http://apocrypha.org/baruch/1-10.htm" title="And they said, Behold, we have sent you money to buy you burnt offerings, and sin offerings, and incense, and prepare ye manna, and offer upon the altar of the Lord our God;...">Bar 1:10-11</a>,) being directed by God so to do, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm" title="And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall you have peace.">Jeremiah 29:7</a>. But afterward becoming more bigoted, they would not pray for any heathen ruler whatever. Nay, the zealots among them held that no obedience was due from the people of God to idolatrous princes, and often raised seditions in the heathen countries, as well as in Judea, against the heathen magistrates. This malevolent disposition some of the Jewish converts brought with them into the Christian Church. The apostle, therefore, agreeably to the true spirit of the gospel, commanded the brethren at Ephesus to pray, both in public and private, for all men, whatever their nation, their religion, or their character might be, and especially for kings. <span class="ital">That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life </span>— God supports the power of magistracy for the sake of his own people, when, in the present state of men, it could not otherwise be kept up in any nation whatever. And we should pray that our rulers may exercise their power in such a wise and equitable manner, that, under the protection of their government, we may live in peace with our neighbours, and undisturbed by foreign enemies. <span class="ital">In all godliness </span>— In the genuine fear, love, worship, and service of God; <span class="ital">and honesty </span>— A comprehensive word, taking in the whole duty we owe to our neighbour. “In the first age, when the disciples of Christ were liable to be persecuted for their religion by their heathen neighbours, it was highly necessary, by praying for kings and all in authority, to make the heathen rulers sensible that they were good subjects. For thus they might expect to be less the object of their hatred.” <span class="ital">For this</span> — That we should pray for them and all men; <span class="ital">is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour </span>— Who has actually saved us, and is willing to save all. For the disciples of Christ thus to pray for all men, especially for their heathen enemies and persecutors, was of excellent use to make the latter sensible how good, how patient, and how benevolent the disciples of Jesus were, and that their religion led them to no seditious practices. Indeed, as Macknight observes, this display of the Christian character was then peculiarly necessary, in that the heathen were apt to confound the Christians with the Jews, and to impute to them the odious spirit and wicked practices of the Jews, who, confining their benevolence to those of their own religion, cherished a most rancorous hatred of all the rest of mankind. <span class="ital">Who will have all men </span>— Not a part only, much less the smallest part; <span class="ital">to be saved </span>— Eternally.

Our duty as Christians, is summed up in two words; godliness, that is, the right worshipping of God; and honesty, that is, good conduct toward all men. These must go together: we are not truly honest, if we are not godly, and do not render to God his due; and we are not truly godly, if not honest. What is acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour, we should abound in. There is one Mediator, and that Mediator gave himself a ransom for all. And this appointment has been made for the benefit of the Jews and the Gentiles of every nation; that all who are willing may come in this way, to the mercy-seat of a pardoning God, to seek reconciliation with him. Sin had made a quarrel between us and God; Jesus Christ is the Mediator who makes peace. He is a ransom that was to be known in due time. In the Old Testament times, his sufferings, and the glory that should follow, were spoken of as things to be revealed in the last times. Those who are saved must come to the knowledge of the truth, for that is God's appointed way to save sinners: if we do not know the truth, we cannot be ruled by it.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/1_timothy/2.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>For kings - On the respect due to rulers, see the notes on <a href="http://biblehub.com/romans/13-1.htm">Romans 13:1-7</a>. The meaning here is, that while all people should be the subjects of prayer, those should be particularly remembered before the throne of grace who are in authority. The reason is, that so much depends on their character and plans; that the security of life, liberty, and property, depends so much on them. God has power to influence their hearts, and to incline them to what is just and equal; and hence we should pray that a divine influence may descend upon them. The salvation of a king is of itself of no more importance than that of a peasant or a slave; but the welfare of thousands may depend on him, and hence he should be made the special subject of prayer.<p>All that are in authority - Margin, or, "eminent place." This does not necessarily mean those who hold office, but refers to any of elevated rank. The happiness of all who are under their control depends greatly on them, and hence we should pray for them that they may be converted people, and inclined to do that which is right.<p>That we may lead a quiet and peaceable life - That their hearts may be so inclined to what is right that they may protect us in the enjoyment of religion, and that we may not be opposed or harassed by persecution. This does not mean that their protection would dispose us to lead quiet and peaceful lives, but that under their protection we may be saved from oppression on account of our religion. Christians are disposed of themselves to be peaceful and orderly; they ask of their rulers only that they may not be harassed in the enjoyment of their rights.<p>In all godliness and honesty - In the practice of all our duties toward God, and of all the duties which we owe to people. The word godliness here denotes piety - or the duty which we owe to God; the word honesty refers to our duties to our fellow-men. The Christian asks from civil rulers such protection that; he maybe enabled quietly to perform both these classes of duties. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/1_timothy/2.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2.

The "quiet" of Christians was often more dependent on subordinate rulers, than on the supreme king; hence, "all &#8230; in authority" are to be prayed for.<p>that we may lead&#8212;that we may be blessed with such good government as to lead &#8230; ; or rather, as Greek, "to pass" or "spend."

A distinct Greek word, 1Ti 2:10, expresses "godliness."<p>honesty&#8212;Greek, "gravity" (Tit 2:2, 7), "decorum," or propriety of conduct. As "piety" is in relation to God, "gravity" is propriety of behavior among men. In the Old Testament the Jews were commanded to pray for their heathen rulers (Ezr 6:10; Jer 29:7). The Jews, by Augustus' order, offered a lamb daily for the Roman emperor, till near the destruction of Jerusalem. The Jewish Zealots, instigated by Eleazar, caused this custom to cease [Josephus, Wars of the Jews, 2.17], whence the war originated, according to Josephus.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/1_timothy/2.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">For kings, and for all that are in authority:</span> the kings of the earth at that time were all heathens, and enemies to the Christian religion, so (generally) were those who were in a subordinate authority to them, yet the apostle commands that prayers should be made in the Christian congregations for them. What the matter of their petitions was to be is not expressed, but doubtless not to be limited by the next words, for that were not to have prayed for them but for themselves. Prayers for magistrates ought to be directed by their circumstances. If magistrates were idolaters and persecutors, they were to pray for their conversion, and the change of their hearts. However, they were to pray for their life and health so far forth as might be for God’s glory, and for God’s guidance of them in the administration of their government, and their success in their lawful counsels and undertakings, &c. The latter words, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty, </span> contain the reason why prayers should be made for governors, and the good effect of them. For it is for this end that the supreme Lord hath ordained the office and dignity of kings and governors, that, being armed with authority and power, they may perserve public order and peace, by punishing evil-doers, and protecting and encouraging those that do well. Thus, under the Old Testament, the Jews were commanded to pray for the peace of the nation or city whither they should be carried captives, for in their peace they should have peace, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-7.htm" title="And seek the peace of the city where I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace thereof shall you have peace.">Jeremiah 29:7</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/1_timothy/2.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>For kings, and for all that are in authority,.... For supreme governors, as the emperor of Rome, and kings of particular nations; and for all sub-governors, or inferior magistrates, as procurators or governors of provinces, and proconsuls, and the like; all that were in high places, and acted under the authority of those that were supreme; these are particularly mentioned, the then governors, whether supreme or subordinate, who were avowed enemies, and violent persecutors of the saints; and it might be a scruple with some of them, whether they should pray for them, and therefore the apostle enjoins it; and this in opposition to the notions and practices of the Jews, who used to curse the Heathens, and pray for none but for themselves, and those of their own nation: <p>that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty; which does not merely design the end of civil government by kings and magistrates, which is to preserve the peace and quiet of the commonwealth; to protect the persons and properties of men, that they may possess their own undisturbed; and to secure to them their civil and religious rights and liberties, that they may have the free use and exercise of religion, signified by "all godliness"; and to encourage morality and virtue, expressed by "honesty"; and so is an argument for prayer, taken from the advantage of civil government: nor does this clause only point out the duty of saints to live peaceably under the government they are, and not disturb it; to mind only their religious exercises among themselves, and behave honestly and morally among men, as they generally speaking are, the quiet in the land; but also expresses the thing to be prayed for; and the sense is, that since the hearts of kings are in the hands of the Lord, and he can turn them as he pleases, prayer should be made to him for them, that he would either convert them, and bring them to the knowledge of the truth, they now persecuted; or at least so dispose their hearts and minds, that they might stop the persecution, and so saints might live peaceably under them, enjoy their religious liberty, and be encouraged in their moral conversation. The Arabic version renders it, "that they may be preserved": that is, kings, and all in authority. It is a saying of R. Hananiah, or Ananias, the sagan of the priests (s), <p>"pray for the peace or safety of the kingdom (one of their commentators on it adds (t), even of the nations of the world, which is remarkable, and agrees with the exhortation of the apostle); for if there was no fear of that, men would devour one another alive.'' <p>(s) Pirke Abot, c. 3. sect. 2.((t) Bartenora in Pirke Abot, c. 3. sect. 2.<a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/1_timothy/2.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For kings, and <i>for</i> all that are in authority; <span class="cverse3">{2}</span> that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and <span class="cverse3">{a}</span> honesty.</span><p>(2) An argument taken of the end: that is, because magistrates are appointed to this end, that men might peaceably and quietly live in all godliness and honesty: and therefore we must commend them especially to God, that they may faithfully execute so necessary an office.<p>(a) This word includes every type of duty, which is to be used by men in all their affairs.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/meyer/1_timothy/2.htm">Meyer's NT Commentary</a></div><a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/2-2.htm" title="For kings, and for all that are in authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.">1 Timothy 2:2</a>. <span class="greekheb">Ὑπὲρ βασιλέων</span>] <span class="greekheb">βασιλεῖς</span> are not merely the Roman emperors, the apostle using the plural because of the emperor’s colleagues (Baur); the word is to be taken, in a more general sense, as denoting the <span class="ital">highest</span> authorities in the state.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="greekheb">καὶ πάντων τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ ὄντων</span>] not only denoting the governors in the provinces, but all who hold the office of magistrate anywhere.

Josephus calls the magistrates simply <span class="greekheb">αἱ ὑπεροχαί</span> (<span class="ital">Antiq.</span> vi. 4. 3). In the old liturgies we find, in express accordance with this passage, the <span class="greekheb">δέησις ὑπὲρ βασιλέων καὶ τῶν ἐν ὑπεροχῇ</span>, <span class="greekheb">ὑπὲρ τῆς εἰρήνης τοῦ σύμπαντος κόσμου</span>. The purpose for which intercession is specially to be made for all men in authority is given in the words that follow: <span class="greekheb">ἵνα ἤρεμον καὶ ἡσύχιον βίον δίαγωμεν</span>, which, as de Wette rightly remarks, denotes the objective and not the subjective purpose. Paul does not mean here to direct attention to the value which intercession has for our own inner life, and by means of this for outward peace, as Heydenreich (“Christians are to pray also for heathen rulers, that by this prayer they may keep alive within themselves the quiet submissive spirit of citizens”), Matthies (“animated with loving thoughts towards the representatives of the government, they are to be blameless in their walk, and to strive after the undisturbed enjoyment of outward peace”), and others think; but the apostle is speaking of the still, quiet life as a blessing which the church obtains by prayer to God for the rulers.[84] The prayer is directed, as Wiesinger rightly remarks, not for the conversion of the heathen rulers, but for the divine blessing necessary to them in the discharge of their office (<a href="https://biblehub.com/romans/13-14.htm" title="But put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfill the lusts thereof.">Romans 13:14</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The adj. <span class="greekheb"><span class="bld"><span class="ital">ἬΡΕΜΟς</span></span></span> occurs only here[85] in the N.

The plural <span class="ital">kings</span> has occasioned some difficulty; since in St. Paul’s time, Timothy and the Ephesian Church were concerned with one king only, the Emperor. Consequently those who deny the Pauline authorship of the Pastorals suppose that the writer here betrays his consciousness of the associated emperors under the Antonines. But, in the first place, he would have written <span class="greekheb">τῶν βασιλέων</span>: and again, the sentiment was intended as a perfectly general one, applicable to all lands.

It is another characteristic word of the Pastoral Epistles. ‘Honesty’ appears to have the same sense as in the Marriage Service, ‘that they may live together in godly love and honesty,’ that is, purity and fidelity to the marriage vow, and therefore well to represent the Greek word which only occurs here and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_timothy/3-4.htm" title="One that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity;">1 Timothy 3:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/titus/2-7.htm" title="In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works: in doctrine showing soundness, gravity, sincerity,">Titus 2:7</a>.
