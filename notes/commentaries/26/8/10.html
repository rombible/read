Creature worship was indeed practised among other nations, and the painting of idolatrous objects upon walls is expressly mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/23-14.htm" title="And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,">Ezekiel 23:14-16</a>, as introduced by the Jews from Chaldæa; yet the combination is so thoroughly Egyptian, and the political relations of the time also point so strongly in the same direction, that the origin seems settled. It was during this period that Jeremiah was obliged to contend strenuously against the desire of a considerable part of the court to enter into an alliance with Egypt against Chaldæa. The party among the Jews who sought an Egyptian alliance, as abundantly appears from Jeremiah, was also the party most unwilling to submit to the Divine commandments. They were the persons who engaged in this creature-worship; and they are here represented as constituting the leaders of the nation. As if this were not enough, “all the idols of the house of Israel,” gathered from every quarter, were also portrayed upon the walls.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>8:7-12 A secret place was, as it were, opened, where the prophet saw creatures painted on the walls, and a number of the elders of Israel worshipped before them. No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>There is clearly a reference to the idolatry of Egypt. Many subterranean chambers in rocks upon the shores of the Nile exhibit ornamentation and hieroglyphical characters, some of which are representative of the objects of idolatrous worship. Such chambers fitted them for the scene of the ideal picture by which Ezekiel represented Egyptian idolatry. The Egyptian worship of animals is well known. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. creeping things &#8230; beasts&#8212;worshipped in Egypt; still found portrayed on their chamber walls; so among the Troglodyt&aelig;.<p>round about&#8212;On every side they surrounded themselves with incentives to superstition.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/8.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">So I went in, </span> according to the vision. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of creeping things; </span> of such creatures as the Egyptians, or any others with whom the Jews had acquaintance, did worship. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Abominable beasts; </span> the beasts are here called abominable, because idolaters had abused them to unlawful uses, making idols of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The idols of the house of Israel; </span> the Jews had multiplied to themselves idols of their own, besides those borrowed from their neighbours.

The construction is difficult: lit. “and behold every likeness (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a></span>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/deuteronomy/4-17.htm" title="The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged fowl that flies in the air,...">Deuteronomy 4:17-18</a>) of creeping things and beasts (cattle), abomination, and all,” &c., the term “abomination” being descriptive both of creeping things and beasts. The term “beasts” is employed of the larger domestic animals, though also of the beasts of prey; it seems nowhere used of the smaller vermin. On the other hand the word “abomination” is chiefly used in regard to the smaller creatures that swarm, whether in the waters or on the land, in the latter case winged and creeping things being included (Leviticus 11), and nowhere of the animals called “beasts.” LXX. omits “likeness of creeping things and beasts,” and it is possible that these words are a marginal gloss explanatory of “abomination.” It has usually been supposed that the reference is to the debased forms of Egyptian superstition. This is possible, for the other practices mentioned, the lamentation for Tammuz and the sun-worship came from abroad. Israel appears to have fallen into the idolatries of the nations about her when she came under their influence, particularly when they became paramount over her, and their gods were thought to be stronger than her own God. The Egyptian influence had been powerful from the days of Isaiah downwards, and even after the battle of Carchemish (b.c. 604) the hope of Egyptian support induced Jehoiakim in his last years and Zedekiah toward the close of his reign to renounce their allegiance to Babylon. On the other hand the practices here mentioned may be rather a revival of ancient superstitions which, during the prosperity of the kingdom and amidst the vigour of the national religion, had fallen into disuse or maintained themselves only as a secret cult, but which, amidst the disasters of the time, when Jehovah appeared to have forsaken the land and men looked to every quarter for aid, again became prevalent (see W. R. Smith, <span class="ital">Religion of the Semites</span>, p. 338). If the LXX. reading be followed the passage may have less significance than has been attributed to it.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and all the idols</span>] the block-gods, see ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm" title="And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.">Ezekiel 6:4</a>.

The alliance between Jehoiakim and Pharaoh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24.htm">2 Kings 24</a>:33-35), and which Zedekiah was endeavouring to renew, would naturally bring about a revival of that cultus.

The king will mourn, and the prince will clothe himself in horror, and the hands of the common people will tremble. I will deal with them according to their way, and according to their judgments will I judge them, that they may learn that I am Jehovah. - Those who have escaped death by sword or famine at the conquest of Jerusalem have captivity and exile awaiting them. This is the meaning of the command to make the chain, i.e., the fetters needed to lead the people into exile. This punishment is necessary, because the land is full of mishpat da&#770;mim, judgment of blood. This cannot mean, there is a judgment upon the shedding of blood, i.e., upon murder, which is conducted by Jehovah, as Hvernick supposes. Such a thought is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, and with the parallel &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be explained after the same manner as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (a matter for sentence of death, a capital crime) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> -22, as signifying a matter for sentence of bloodshed, i.e., a crime of blood, or capital crime, as the Chaldee has already rendered it. Because the land is filled with capital crime, the city (Jerusalem) with violence, the Lord will bring &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, evil ones of the heathen, i.e., the worst of the heathen, to put an end to the pride of the Israelites. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not "pride of the insolents;" for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not stand for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>, etc.). The expression is rather to be explained from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;, pride of strength, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>), and embraces everything on which a man (or a nation) bases his power and rests his confidence. The Israelites are called &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because they thought themselves strong, or, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>, based their strength upon the possession of the temple and the holy land. This is indicated by &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  which follows. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, Niphal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, not a participle Piel, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, with the Dagesh dropped, but an unusual form, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (vid., Ew. 215a). - The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1495;&#1492;&#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1496;&#894;, with the tone drawn back on account of the tone-syllable which follows (cf. Ges. 29, 3. 6), signifies excidium, destruction (according to the Rabbins), from &#1511;&#1508;&#1491;, to shrink or roll up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is a prophetic perfect. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-25.htm">Ezekiel 7:25</a> the ruin of the kingdom is declared to be certain, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a> the occurrence of it is more minutely depicted. Stroke upon stroke does the ruin come; and it is intensified by reports, alarming accounts, which crowd together and increase the terror, and also by the desperation of the spiritual and temporal leaders of the nation - the prophets, priests, and elders - whom God deprives of revelation, knowledge, and counsel; so that all ranks (king and princes and the common people) sink into mourning, alarm, and horror. That it is to no purpose that visions or prophecies are sought from the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>), is evident from the antithetical statement concerning the priests and elders which immediately follows. The three statements serve as complements of one another. They seek for predictions from prophets, but the prophets receive no vision, no revelation. They seek instruction from priests, but instruction is withdrawn from the priests; and so forth. T&#772;o&#772;ra&#770;h signifies instruction out of the law, which the priests were to give to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>, the three classes into which the people were divided are mentioned - viz. king, prince (i.e., tribe-princes and heads of families), and, in contradistinction to both, &#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the common people, the people of the land, in distinction from the civil rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, literally from their way, their mode of action, will I do to them: i.e., my action will be derived from theirs, and regulated accordingly. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>, etc. (See the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>.) </body></html>
