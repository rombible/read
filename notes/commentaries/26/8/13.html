The Lord appeals to the prophet concerning the heinousness of the crime; and lo, they put the branch to their nose, denoting some custom used by idolaters in honour of the idols they served. The more we examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>In the dark - Hidden in the secret places which the seer dug through the wall to discover.<p>Chambers of his imagery - i. e., chambers painted with images. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. every man in &#8230; chambers of &#8230; imagery&#8212;The elders ("ancients") are here the representatives of the people, rather than to be regarded literally. Mostly, the leaders of heathen superstitions laughed at them secretly, while publicly professing them in order to keep the people in subjection. Here what is meant is that the people generally addicted themselves to secret idolatry, led on by their elders; there is no doubt, also, allusion to the mysteries, as in the worship of Isis in Egypt, the Eleusinian in Greece, &c., to which the initiated alone were admitted. "The chambers of imagery" are their own perverse imaginations, answering to the priests' chambers in the vision, whereon the pictures were portrayed (Eze 8:10).<p>Lord &#8230; forsaken &#8230; earth&#8212;They infer this because God has left them to their miseries, without succoring them, so that they seek help from other gods.

The king will mourn, and the prince will clothe himself in horror, and the hands of the common people will tremble. I will deal with them according to their way, and according to their judgments will I judge them, that they may learn that I am Jehovah. - Those who have escaped death by sword or famine at the conquest of Jerusalem have captivity and exile awaiting them. This is the meaning of the command to make the chain, i.e., the fetters needed to lead the people into exile. This punishment is necessary, because the land is full of mishpat da&#770;mim, judgment of blood. This cannot mean, there is a judgment upon the shedding of blood, i.e., upon murder, which is conducted by Jehovah, as Hvernick supposes. Such a thought is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, and with the parallel &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be explained after the same manner as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (a matter for sentence of death, a capital crime) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> -22, as signifying a matter for sentence of bloodshed, i.e., a crime of blood, or capital crime, as the Chaldee has already rendered it. Because the land is filled with capital crime, the city (Jerusalem) with violence, the Lord will bring &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, evil ones of the heathen, i.e., the worst of the heathen, to put an end to the pride of the Israelites. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not "pride of the insolents;" for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not stand for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>, etc.). The expression is rather to be explained from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;, pride of strength, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>), and embraces everything on which a man (or a nation) bases his power and rests his confidence. The Israelites are called &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because they thought themselves strong, or, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>, based their strength upon the possession of the temple and the holy land. This is indicated by &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  which follows. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, Niphal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, not a participle Piel, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, with the Dagesh dropped, but an unusual form, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (vid., Ew. 215a). - The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1495;&#1492;&#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1496;&#894;, with the tone drawn back on account of the tone-syllable which follows (cf. Ges. 29, 3. 6), signifies excidium, destruction (according to the Rabbins), from &#1511;&#1508;&#1491;, to shrink or roll up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is a prophetic perfect. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-25.htm">Ezekiel 7:25</a> the ruin of the kingdom is declared to be certain, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a> the occurrence of it is more minutely depicted. Stroke upon stroke does the ruin come; and it is intensified by reports, alarming accounts, which crowd together and increase the terror, and also by the desperation of the spiritual and temporal leaders of the nation - the prophets, priests, and elders - whom God deprives of revelation, knowledge, and counsel; so that all ranks (king and princes and the common people) sink into mourning, alarm, and horror. That it is to no purpose that visions or prophecies are sought from the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>), is evident from the antithetical statement concerning the priests and elders which immediately follows. The three statements serve as complements of one another. They seek for predictions from prophets, but the prophets receive no vision, no revelation. They seek instruction from priests, but instruction is withdrawn from the priests; and so forth. T&#772;o&#772;ra&#770;h signifies instruction out of the law, which the priests were to give to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>, the three classes into which the people were divided are mentioned - viz. king, prince (i.e., tribe-princes and heads of families), and, in contradistinction to both, &#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the common people, the people of the land, in distinction from the civil rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, literally from their way, their mode of action, will I do to them: i.e., my action will be derived from theirs, and regulated accordingly. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>, etc. (See the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>.) </body></html>
