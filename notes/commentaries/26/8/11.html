The seventy elders were not the sanhedrin, which was not constituted until after the return from Babylon; but the number has probable reference to the seventy chosen to enjoy with Moses the Theophany of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/exodus/24-9.htm" title="Then went up Moses, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel:">Exodus 24:9-10</a>, and the other seventy selected to share with him in the gifts of the Spirit (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a>). In contrast with those selected for especial nearness to God, these seventy are engaged in abominations most abhorrent to Him.<p><span class= "bld">Jaazaniah, the son of Shaphan.</span>—<span class= "ital">Son </span>is perhaps used here, as often in Scripture, in the sense of <span class= "ital">grandson. </span>In this case he may have been the same with “Jaazaniah, the son of Azur,” mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm" title="Moreover the spirit lifted me up, and brought me to the east gate of the LORD's house, which looks eastward: and behold at the door of the gate five and twenty men; among whom I saw Jaazaniah the son of Azur, and Pelatiah the son of Benaiah, princes of the people.">Ezekiel 11:1</a> as one of the wicked princes of the people, against whom Ezekiel was directed to prophesy. It is hardly probable that two persons of the same character and the same (not very common) name should have been among the leaders of the people at the same time. The mention of his grandfather here would be appropriate, as bringing out the contrast in their characters, and showing the change for the worse that had been going on among the people. Shaphan was an officer of the court of King Josiah, and active in the reformation instituted by him (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm" title="And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,">2Kings 22:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>); while his son (Elasah) was one of the messengers by whom Jeremiah sent his prophecies to the Captivity (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm" title="By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying,">Jeremiah 29:3</a>); and another son, Gemariah, was a scribe, having a chamber “in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the Lord’s house,” in the fourth year of Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>). At the same time his grandson, Michaiah, was sufficiently prominent at court to join in the intercession of the princes against the destruction of Jeremiah’s prophecies (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-11.htm" title="When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD,">Jeremiah 36:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-25.htm" title="Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them.">Jeremiah 36:25</a>); and a little later, in the general captivity of the ninth year of Zedekiah, another grandson, Gedaliah, had the person of Jeremiah given into his charge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm" title="Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.">Jeremiah 39:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-5.htm" title="Now while he was not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon has made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seems convenient to you to go. So the captain of the guard gave him victuals and a reward, and let him go.">Jeremiah 40:5</a>), and was made governor over the remnant of the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/40-11.htm" title="Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan;">Jeremiah 40:11</a>). Such being the family connections of Jaazaniah, the corruption which could make him a leader of idolatry is strongly shown.<p><span class= "bld">With every man his censer in his hand.</span>—The burning of incense was the exclusive function of the priesthood (Numbers 16; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/2_chronicles/26-16.htm" title="But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense on the altar of incense.">2Chronicles 26:16-18</a>); and it was alike the necessity and the choice of the idolaters of Israel to devolve this office upon those who were not of the Aaronic family. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/12-31.htm" title="And he made an house of high places, and made priests of the lowest of the people, which were not of the sons of Levi.">1Kings 12:31</a>.)

No superiority in worldly matters will preserve men from lust, or idolatries, when they are left to their own deceitful hearts; and those who are soon wearied in the service of God, often grudge no toil nor expense when following their superstitions. When hypocrites screen themselves behind the wall of an outward profession, there is some hole or other left in the wall, something that betrays them to those who look diligently. There is a great deal of secret wickedness in the world. They think themselves out of God's sight. But those are ripe indeed for ruin, who lay the blame of their sins upon the Lord.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Seventy men - Compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9-10</a>. The vision may have pointed to the contrast between the times. The number "seven" is symbolic of the covenant between Yahweh and His people, and so the "seventy" men exhibit forcibly the breach of the covenant. It is a figure of the covert idolatry of the whole people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/8.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. seventy men&#8212;the seventy members composing the Sanhedrim, or great council of the nation, the origination of which we find in the seventy elders, representatives of the congregation, who went up with Moses to the mount to behold the glory of Jehovah, and to witness the secret transactions relating to the establishment of the covenant; also, in the seventy elders appointed to share the burden of the people with Moses. How awfully it aggravates the national sin, that the seventy, once admitted to the Lord's secret council (Ps 25:14), should now, "in the dark," enter "the secret" of the wicked (Ge 49:6), those judicially bound to suppress idolatry being the ringleaders of it!<p>Jaazaniah&#8212;perhaps chief of the seventy: son of Shaphan, the scribe who read to Josiah the book of the law; the spiritual privileges of the son (2Ki 22:10-14) increased his guilt. The very name means, "Jehovah hears," giving the lie to the unbelief which virtually said (Eze 9:9), "The Lord seeth us not," &c. (compare Ps 10:11, 14; 50:21; 94:7, 9).

The seventy were not any court such as the later Sanhedrim, but merely seventy men representing the elders of Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-1.htm" title="And he said to Moses, Come up to the LORD, you, and Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel; and worship you afar off.">Exodus 24:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-16.htm" title="And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with you.">Numbers 11:16</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/numbers/11-24.htm" title="And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them round about the tabernacle....">Numbers 11:24-25</a>). The elders were the leaders of the people, and probably here represent them. Prominent among these elders was Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan. There is no reason to suppose the name fictitious. Shaphan the scribe was the person who read the Book of the Law found in the temple to king Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-10.htm" title="And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.">2 Kings 22:10</a>). A son of his son Ahikam acted along with him and was a protector of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm" title="Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelled among the people.">Jeremiah 39:14</a>), and another son is mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm" title="Then read Baruch in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD's house, in the ears of all the people.">Jeremiah 36:10</a>) as having a chamber in the upper court where Baruch read Jeremiah’s roll in the ears of the people. If Jaazaniah was a son of this Shaphan he pursued a different course from his father and brothers.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Seventy men</span>, etc. The number was probably chosen with reference to the "elders" who had seen the Divine glory in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/24-9.htm">Exodus 24:9, 10</a>. The Sanhedrin, or council of seventy, did not exist till after the Captivity. The number can scarcely have been accidental, and may imply that the elders were formally representative. Another Jaazaniah, the son of Jeremiah, appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/35-3.htm">Jeremiah 35:3</a>; yet another, the son of Azur, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>. If the Shaphan mentioned is the scribe, the son of Azaliah, under Josiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-3.htm">2 Kings 22:3</a>), the father of Ahikam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-12.htm">2 Kings 22:12</a>), of Elasah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-3.htm">Jeremiah 29:3</a>), and of Gemariah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/36-10.htm">Jeremiah 36:10, 11, 12</a>), and the grandfather of Gedaliah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-14.htm">Jeremiah 39:14</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>), all of whom were prominent in the reform movement under Josiah, or as friends of Jeremiah, and no other Shaphan appears in history, the fact that one of his sons is the leader of the idolatrous company must have had for Ezekiel a specially painful significance. He could scarcely have forgotten the meaning of his name, "The Lord is listening," and probably refers to it in ver. 12. As the climax of this chamber of horrors, the seventy elders were all acting as priests, and were offering to their pictured idols the incense which none but the sons of Aaron had a right to use, and which they offered to Jehovah only. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fourth Strophe<p>Still worse is coming, namely, the captivity of the people, and overthrow of the kingdom. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-23.htm">Ezekiel 7:23</a>.

The king will mourn, and the prince will clothe himself in horror, and the hands of the common people will tremble. I will deal with them according to their way, and according to their judgments will I judge them, that they may learn that I am Jehovah. - Those who have escaped death by sword or famine at the conquest of Jerusalem have captivity and exile awaiting them. This is the meaning of the command to make the chain, i.e., the fetters needed to lead the people into exile. This punishment is necessary, because the land is full of mishpat da&#770;mim, judgment of blood. This cannot mean, there is a judgment upon the shedding of blood, i.e., upon murder, which is conducted by Jehovah, as Hvernick supposes. Such a thought is irreconcilable with &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;, and with the parallel &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492; &#1495;&#1502;&#1505;. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501; is to be explained after the same manner as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; (a matter for sentence of death, a capital crime) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-6.htm">Deuteronomy 19:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/19-21.htm">Deuteronomy 19:21</a> -22, as signifying a matter for sentence of bloodshed, i.e., a crime of blood, or capital crime, as the Chaldee has already rendered it. Because the land is filled with capital crime, the city (Jerusalem) with violence, the Lord will bring &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;, evil ones of the heathen, i.e., the worst of the heathen, to put an end to the pride of the Israelites. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; is not "pride of the insolents;" for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; does not stand for &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-50.htm">Deuteronomy 28:50</a>, etc.). The expression is rather to be explained from &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;, pride of strength, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>), and embraces everything on which a man (or a nation) bases his power and rests his confidence. The Israelites are called &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, because they thought themselves strong, or, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>, based their strength upon the possession of the temple and the holy land. This is indicated by &#1493;&#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;  which follows. &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, Niphal of &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, not a participle Piel, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, with the Dagesh dropped, but an unusual form, from &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; for &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (vid., Ew. 215a). - The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1495;&#1492;&#1510;&#1504;&#1510;&#1496;&#894;, with the tone drawn back on account of the tone-syllable which follows (cf. Ges. 29, 3. 6), signifies excidium, destruction (according to the Rabbins), from &#1511;&#1508;&#1491;, to shrink or roll up (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-12.htm">Isaiah 38:12</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1488; is a prophetic perfect. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-25.htm">Ezekiel 7:25</a> the ruin of the kingdom is declared to be certain, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a> the occurrence of it is more minutely depicted. Stroke upon stroke does the ruin come; and it is intensified by reports, alarming accounts, which crowd together and increase the terror, and also by the desperation of the spiritual and temporal leaders of the nation - the prophets, priests, and elders - whom God deprives of revelation, knowledge, and counsel; so that all ranks (king and princes and the common people) sink into mourning, alarm, and horror. That it is to no purpose that visions or prophecies are sought from the prophets (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-26.htm">Ezekiel 7:26</a>), is evident from the antithetical statement concerning the priests and elders which immediately follows. The three statements serve as complements of one another. They seek for predictions from prophets, but the prophets receive no vision, no revelation. They seek instruction from priests, but instruction is withdrawn from the priests; and so forth. T&#772;o&#772;ra&#770;h signifies instruction out of the law, which the priests were to give to the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/malachi/2-7.htm">Malachi 2:7</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-27.htm">Ezekiel 7:27</a>, the three classes into which the people were divided are mentioned - viz. king, prince (i.e., tribe-princes and heads of families), and, in contradistinction to both, &#1506;&#1501; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the common people, the people of the land, in distinction from the civil rulers, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-24.htm">2 Kings 21:24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-30.htm">2 Kings 23:30</a>. &#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1501;, literally from their way, their mode of action, will I do to them: i.e., my action will be derived from theirs, and regulated accordingly. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1501;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-22.htm">Ezekiel 3:22</a>, etc. (See the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a>.) </body></html>
