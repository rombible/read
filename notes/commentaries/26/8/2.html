That vision bursts again on the prophet after he has been carried in the spirit to the Temple at Jerusalem (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-4.htm" title="And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.">Ezekiel 8:4</a>). This is not expressly described as a human form, but from the mention of the loins, and of “the form of an hand,” in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm" title="And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.">Ezekiel 8:3</a> it is implied that it was so. No further description is given, except that it was something bright and glorious like fire; and by the repetition of the words “likeness,” “appearance,” and “form of an hand,” the prophet here, as in Ezekiel 1, takes pains to show that it was only a vision, not an outward reality. It is also to be remembered that this and the subsequent vision occurred while the elders were sitting before the prophet. They saw nothing themselves, but must have witnessed his ecstasy, and thus have been prepared for his telling them at its close (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-25.htm" title="Then I spoke to them of the captivity all the things that the LORD had showed me.">Ezekiel 11:25</a>) “all the things that the Lord had showed” him. “The colour of amber” is the same as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm" title="And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.">Ezekiel 1:4</a>, where see Note.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/8.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-2.htm" title="Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.">Ezekiel 8:2</a>. </span><span class="ital">I beheld, and lo a likeness — </span>Namely, of a man; the man whom he had seen upon the throne; <span class="ital">as the appearance of fire — </span>This seems to have been the same appearance as that mentioned before, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm" title="And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.">Ezekiel 1:27</a>, signifying that God was about to inflict heavy judgments on the Jewish nation, but so as not entirely to destroy it.

The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "behold the likeness of a man"; reading  "a man", for  "fire"; but without supposing such a reading, for which there is no foundation, this likeness may very well be understood of the likeness of a man; since mention is made of his joins in the next clause, and of his hand in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-3.htm">Ezekiel 8:3</a>; and the description agrees with the appearance of a man in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-26.htm">Ezekiel 1:26</a>; it was usual for the Son of God, who doubtless is here meant, to appear in a human form; and so Junius and Tremellius supply the words, <p>"and lo a likeness "of a man", as in the appearance of fire:'' <p>it was the form of a fiery man that was seen, as he is further described: <p>from the appearance of his loins, even downward, fire; his lower parts, thighs, legs, and feet; expressive either of the light of grace communicated from Christ to his people; or of his fervent love towards them, or flaming zeal for God and his house; or rather of his wrath against an idolatrous people; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/1-15.htm">Revelation 1:15</a>; a like description is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-27.htm">Ezekiel 1:27</a>; <p>and from his loins, even upward, as the appearance of brightness; his upper parts, back, belly, breast, shoulders, arms, head, &amp;c. which may denote his incomprehensible majesty and glory; his glory being the glory of the only begotten, the brightness of his Father's glory, and the express image of his person. The Targum renders both the one and the other part of the description thus, <p>"and I saw, and twelve a likeness as the look of fire, the look of glory, which the eye cannot see, nor is it possible to look upon it; and beneath the look of fire, and the look of glory, which the eye cannot behold, nor is it possible to contemplate it; and above, as the look of brightness:'' <p>as the colour of amber: or "chasmal": which some take to be the name of an angel.

The prophet speaks with reverential vagueness of God—“a likeness as the appearance of a man,” and “he put forth the likeness of a hand.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/8.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I beheld, and lo a likeness,</span> etc. The vision opens with a theophany like that of ch. 1; but here, as there, Ezekiel uses the word which emphasizes the fact that what he had seen was but a "likeness" of the ineffable glory, an image of the Unseen. (For "amber," see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-4.htm">Ezekiel 1:4, 27</a>.) In this case we note the absence of the cherubic figures. It is simply the "appearance of the likeness of the glory of Jehovah," seen now in the glow of fire, without the milder, more hopeful brightness of the rainbow (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-28.htm">Ezekiel 1:28</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/7.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Third strophe<p>Thus will they fall into irresistible destruction; even their silver and gold they will not rescue, but will cast it away as useless, and leave it for the enemy. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a>.

They will throw their silver into the streets, and their gold will be as filth to them. Their silver and their gold will not be able to rescue them in the day of Jehovah's wrath; they will not satisfy their souls therewith, nor fill their stomachs thereby, for it was to them a stumbling-block to guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a>.

And I shall give it into the hand of foreigners for prey, and to the wicked of the earth for spoil, that they may defile it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-22.htm">Ezekiel 7:22</a>. I shall turn my face from them, that they defile my treasure; and oppressors shall come upon it and defile it. - The chastisement of God penetrates everywhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-15.htm">Ezekiel 7:15</a> compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>); even flight to the mountains, that are inaccessible to the foe (compare 1 Macc. 2:28; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-16.htm">Matthew 24:16</a>), will only bring misery. Those who have fled to the mountains will coo - i.e., mourn, moan - like the doves of the valleys, which (as Bochart has correctly interpreted the simile in his Hieroz. II. p. 546, ed. Ros.), "when alarmed by the bird-catcher or the hawk, are obliged to forsake their natural abode, and fly elsewhere to save their lives. The mountain doves are contrasted with those of the valleys, as wild with tame." In &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1501; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; the figure and the fact are fused together. The words actually relate to the men who have fled; whereas the gender of &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; is made to agree with that of &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;. The cooing of doves was regarded by the ancients as a moan (ha&#770;ga&#770;h), a mournful note (for proofs, see Gesen. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/38-14.htm">Isaiah 38:14</a>); for which Ezekiel uses the still stronger expression ha&#770;ma&#770;h fremere, to howl or growl (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a>). The low moaning has reference to their iniquity, the punishment of which they are enduring. When the judgment bursts upon them, they will all (not merely those who have escaped, but the whole nation) be overwhelmed with terror, shame, and suffering. The words, "all knees flow with water" (for ha&#770;lak in this sense, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/4-18.htm">Joel 4:18</a>), are a hyperbolical expression used to denote the entire loss of the strength of the knees (here, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-17.htm">Ezekiel 7:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-12.htm">Ezekiel 21:12</a>), like the heart melting and turning to water in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-5.htm">Joshua 7:5</a>. With this utter despair there are associated grief and horror at the calamity that has fallen upon them, and shame and pain at the thought of the sins that have plunged them into such distress. For &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492; &#1508;&#1500;&#1468;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-6.htm">Psalm 55:6</a>; for &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/7-10.htm">Micah 7:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/51-51.htm">Jeremiah 51:51</a>; and for &#1511;&#1512;&#1495;&#1492;  '&#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1512;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/15-2.htm">Isaiah 15:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-10.htm">Amos 8:10</a>. On the custom of shaving the head bald on account of great suffering or deep sorrow, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>.<p>In this state of anguish they will throw all their treasures away as sinful trash (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>.). By the silver and gold which they will throw away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a>), we are not to understand idolatrous images particularly - these are first spoken of in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-20.htm">Ezekiel 7:20</a> - but the treasures of precious metals on which they had hitherto set their hearts. They will not merely throw these away as worthless, but look upon them as nidda&#770;h, filth, an object of disgust, inasmuch as they have been the servants of their evil lust. The next clause, "silver and gold cannot rescue them," are a reminiscence from <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>. But Ezekiel gives greater force to the thought by adding, "they will not appease their hunger therewith," - that is to say, they will not be able to protect their lives thereby, either from the sword of the enemy (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-18.htm">Zephaniah 1:18</a>) or from death by starvation, because there will be no more food to purchase within the besieged city. The clause '&#1499;&#1468;&#1497; assigns the reason for that which forms the leading thought of the verse, namely, the throwing away of the silver and gold as filth; &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500; &#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, a stumbling-block through which one falls into guilt and punishment; &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1506;&#1491;&#1497;&#1493;, the beauty of his ornament, i.e., his beautiful ornament. The allusion is to the silver and gold; and the singular suffix is to be explained from the fact that the prophet fixed his mind upon the people as a whole, and used the singular in a general and indefinite sense. The words are written absolutely at the commencement of the sentence; hence the suffix attached to &#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, Jerome has given the true meaning of the words: "what I((God) gave for an ornament of the possessors and for their wealth, they turned into pride." And not merely to ostentatious show (in the manner depicted in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-16.htm">Isaiah 3:16</a>.), but to abominable images, i.e., idols, did they apply the costly gifts of God (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-4.htm">Hosea 8:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/13-2.htm">Hosea 13:2</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;, to make of (gold and silver); &#1489; denoting the material with which one works and of which anything is made (as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-4.htm">Exodus 31:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/38-8.htm">Exodus 38:8</a>). God punishes this abuse by making it (gold and silver) into nidda&#770;h to them, i.e., according to v. 19, by placing them in such circumstances that they cast it away as filth, and (v. 21) by giving it as booty to the foe. The enemy is described as "the wicked of the earth" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-9.htm">Psalm 75:9</a>), i.e., godless men, who not only seize upon the possession of Israel, but in the most wicked manner lay hands upon all that is holy, and defile it. The Chetib &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is to be retained, notwithstanding the fact that it was preceded by a masculine suffix. What is threatened will take place, because the Lord will turn away His face from His people (&#1502;&#1492;&#1501;, from the Israelites), i.e., will withdraw His gracious protection from them, so that the enemy will be able to defile His treasure. Tsa&#770;phuun, that which is hidden, the treasure (<a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a>). Tsephuunii is generally supposed to refer to the temple, or the Most Holy Place in the temple. Jerome renders it arcanum meum, and gives this explanation: "signifying the Holy of Holies, which no one except the priests and the high priest dared to enter." This interpretation was so commonly adopted by the Fathers, that even Theodoret explains the rendering given in the Septuagint, &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3c3;&#x3ba;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd; &#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;, as signifying the Most Holy Place in the temple. On the other hand, the Chaldee has &#1488;&#1512;&#1506;&#1488; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1497;&#1504;&#1514;&#1497;, "the land of the house of my majesty;" and Calvin understands it as signifying "the land which was safe under His (i.e., God's) protection." But it is difficult to reconcile either explanation with the use of the word tsa&#770;phuun. The verb tsa&#770;phan signifies to hide, shelter, lay up in safety. These meanings do not befit either the Holy of Holies in the temple or the land of Israel. It is true that the Holy of Holies was unapproachable by the laity, and even by the ordinary priests, but it was not a secret, a hidden place; and still less was this the case with the land of Canaan.We therefore adhere to the meaning, which is so thoroughly sustained by <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/20-26.htm">Job 20:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-6.htm">Obadiah 1:6</a> - namely, "treasure," by which, no doubt, the temple-treasure is primarily intended. This rendering suits the context, as only treasures have been referred to before; and it may be made to harmonize with &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468; which follows. &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488; &#1489; signifies not merely intrare in locum, but also venire in (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-23.htm">2 Kings 6:23</a>; possibly <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-4.htm">Ezekiel 30:4</a>), and may therefore be very properly rendered, "to get possession of," since it is only possible to obtain possession of a treasure by penetrating into the place where it is laid up or concealed. There is nothing at variance with this in the word &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;, profanare, since it has already occurred in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-21.htm">Ezekiel 7:21</a> in connection with the defiling of treasures and jewels. Moreover, as Calvin has correctly observed, the word is employed here to denote "an indiscriminate abuse, when, instead of considering to what purpose things have been entrusted to us, we squander them rashly and without selection, in contempt and even in scorn." </body></html>
