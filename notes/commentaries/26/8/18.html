The more we examine human nature and our own hearts, the more abominations we shall discover; and the longer the believer searches himself, the more he will humble himself before God, and the more will he value the fountain open for sin, and seek to wash therein.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/8.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>"Violence" represents sin against man, "abominations" sins against God.

The fact that the things described were seen in the “visions of God,” the symbolical form in which Jehovah appeared, and the analogy of ch. 9, 10, lead to the conclusion that there is at least an ideal and symbolical element in the representation of the idolatries practised in the temple. The view of Hitz., Kuen. (<span class="ital">Onders</span>. ii. 278) that the idolatrous practices are to be taken literally but referred to the time of Manasseh is not natural. The prophet would hardly be shewn things once but no longer in existence, though of course he might take a continuous view of Israel’s practice, as he often does. The tense in <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm" title="Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, see, they put the branch to their nose.">Ezekiel 8:17</a></span> “which they have committed here” is scarcely evidence for a former generation. It is not easy to say how far the representation that the idolatrous usages were practised <span class="ital">in</span> the temple is to be taken literally. Such practices are not referred to by Jeremiah nor other prophets of the time. It is possible that the chambers and cells about the gateways, which appear in some cases to have belonged to private persons, may have been used for illegitimate purposes, but that sun-worship was actually practised between the temple and the altar has little probability. And the scene in the chamber of imagery is obviously ideal. The prophet certainly desires to shew that idolatry both public and in private was practised by all classes, the elders representing the nation, the women, and perhaps also the priests; and that at these idolatries were not only the old native ones of Israel, but new imports at this period from all the nations around. The representation, however, that such things were done <span class="ital">in</span> the temple may rather be ideal. The temple was the dwelling-place of Jehovah, and every impurity done not only there but in the land and in the houses of the people was felt in the place of his abode, which it defiled, causing him to withdraw from it (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm" title="He said furthermore to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.">Ezekiel 8:6</a></span>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-31.htm" title="Thus shall you separate the children of Israel from their uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they defile my tabernacle that is among them.">Leviticus 15:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-3.htm" title="And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he has given of his seed to Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.">Leviticus 20:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-13.htm" title="Whoever touches the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifies not himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet on him.">Numbers 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/19-20.htm" title="But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the congregation, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD: the water of separation has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean.">Numbers 19:20</a>; and the elaborate precautions to guard against defilement adopted in ch. 40–48). On the other hand those privileged to dwell in the land or have access to the temple are spoken of as dwelling <span class="ital">in</span> the house, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/23-6.htm" title="Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.">Psalm 23:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/27-4.htm" title="One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple.">Psalm 27:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/84-5.htm" title="Blessed is the man whose strength is in you; in whose heart are the ways of them.">Psalm 84:5</a> &c.

And He said to me, Son of man, lift up thine eyes now towards the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the north, and, behold, to the north of the gate of the altar was this image of jealousy at the entrance. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-6.htm">Ezekiel 8:6</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, seest thou what they do? great abominations, which the house of Israel doeth here, that I may go far away from my sanctuary; and thou shalt yet again see greater abominations still. - As Ezekiel had taken his stand in the inner court at the entrance of the north gate, and when looking thence towards the north saw the image of jealousy to the north of the altar gate, the image must have stood on the outer side of the entrance, so that the prophet saw it as he looked through the open doorway. The altar gate is the same as the northern gate of the inner court mentioned in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3.htm">Ezekiel 3</a>. But it is impossible to state with certainty how it came to be called the altar gate. Possibly from the circumstance that the sacrificial animals were taken through this gate to the altar, to be slaughtered on the northern side of the altar, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-4.htm">Leviticus 1:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-11.htm">Leviticus 5:11</a>, etc. &#1502;&#1492;&#1501;, contracted from &#1502;&#1492;&#1470;&#1492;&#1501;, like &#1502;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492; from &#1502;&#1492; &#1494;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-2.htm">Exodus 4:2</a>. The words "what they are doing here" do not force us to assume that at that very time they were worshipping the idol. They simply describe what was generally practised there. The setting up of the image involved the worship of it. The subject to &#1500;&#1512;&#1495;&#1511;&#1492; is not the house of Israel, but Jehovah. They perform great abominations, so that Jehovah is compelled to go to a distance from His sanctuary, i.e., to forsake it (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>), because they make it an idol-temple. </body></html>
