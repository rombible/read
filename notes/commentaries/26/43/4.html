When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>By this gate the glory of the Lord had departed.

This was six cubits (sc., measured) by the cubit and handbreadth - that is to say, six cubits, each of which was of the length of a (common) cubit and a handbreadth (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-13.htm">Ezekiel 43:13</a>); in all, therefore, six cubits and six handbreadths. The ordinary or common cubit, judging from the statement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/3-3.htm">2 Chronicles 3:3</a>, that the measure of Solomon's temple was regulated according to the earlier measure, had become shorter in the course of time than the old Mosaic or sacred cubit. Fro the new temple, therefore, the measure is regulated according to a longer cubit, in all probability according to the old sacred cubit of the Mosaic law, which was a handbreadth longer than the common cubit according to the passage before us, or seven handbreadths of the ordinary cubit. &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1503;, the masonry, is the building of the wall, which was one rod broad, i.e., thick, and the same in height. The length of this wall is not given, and can only be learned from the further description of the whole wall (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>). </body></html>
