Nothing is here said of the pouring the rest of the blood at the foot of the altar, as required in the law, and nothing of the burning of the fat upon the altar, because the prophet throughout supposes the ritual of the sacrifices to be well known, and only mentions a few particulars to indicate the whole, and also a few others now introduced, peculiar to the new ceremonial.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>43:1-27 After Ezekiel had surveyed the temple of God, he had a vision of the glory of God. When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The seed of Zadok - See <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-46.htm">Ezekiel 40:46</a> note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/43.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>20. cleanse&#8212;literally, "make expiation for."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/43.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt take; </span> appoint it to be taken. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the blood thereof; </span> of the slain bullock. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Put it, </span> not all, but some of the blood, on the horns of the altar, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-30.htm" title="And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.">Leviticus 4:30</a></span> prescribeth, and as Moses did, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/8-15.htm" title="And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make reconciliation on it.">Leviticus 8:15</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of the settle, </span> on which the altar stood, which was two cubits high, and set upon one of a cubit high from the ground. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Upon the border:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-17.htm" title="And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.">Ezekiel 43:17</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Cleanse and purge it; </span> make it legally clean, that it may be fit for so sacred a use as this of sacrificing was. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/43.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And thou shalt take of the blood thereof,.... Ezekiel being a priest. This must be understood in a visionary way; for, as Kimchi observes, Ezekiel did not live to come up out of the captivity, but died, and was buried in the land of Babylon, and so did not actually do this: though it is a mere dream of the same writer, that this is to be understood of the resurrection of the dead, when he supposes Ezekiel will be high priest, though Aaron be present; or however be the second, or deputy to him. <p>And put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about; that is, on the four horns of the altar, and on the four corners of the settle which went round it, for the priests to walk on, and do their business; either the uppermost, or as others the lowermost, and as some both; and also on the border or ledge that enclosed the settle. The prophet's doing this, putting the blood on these several things, represents the nature of the Gospel ministry, and the business of it; which is to hold forth the blood of Christ, and the blessings of grace through it, as redemption, peace, pardon, righteousness, and life. <p>Thus shall thou cleanse and purge it; the altar; thus Christ, though without sin, and needed no cleansing and purging for himself, yet was sanctified by his own blood; that he might sanctify his people, and perfect by his sacrifice them that were sanctified, <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-19.htm">John 17:19</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/43.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge it.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/43.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>.

To “cleanse” is to purify from sin, to “un-sin,” if such a word could be formed; and to “purge” is usually rendered “to make atonement for.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/43.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 20.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it</span>. The application of the victim's blood to and upon the altar formed an integral part of every expiatory offering; but "whereas in all the other kinds of sacrifice the blood was poured indifferently round about the altar of the fore court, in the sin offering it was not to be <span class="accented">sprinkled</span>, lest the intention should be overlooked, but <span class="accented">smeared</span> with the finger upon the horns of the altar ('And the priest shall put of the blood upon the horns,' <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-7.htm">Leviticus 4:7, 18, 25, 30, 34</a>) (Kurtz, 'Sacrificial Worship of the Old Testament,' &sect; 107). In the present instance the blood was to be carefully put upon <span class="cmt_word">the four horns</span> of the altar - the only part to be smeared with blood in the Mosaic  consecration (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-12.htm">Exodus 29:12</a>) - <span class="cmt_word">the four corners of the settle</span>, or azarah, but whether the greater or lesser is left undecided, though in all probability it was the under, if not both, and <span class="cmt_word">the border round about</span>, that mentioned in ver. 17; and the effect of this smearing with blood should be to <span class="cmt_word">cleanse and purge</span>, or, <span class="accented">make atonement</span> for, the altar; not for the people, as Havernick interprets, saying, "without an atoned-for altar, no atoned-for people (<span class="accented">ohne entsuhnten Altar</span>, <span class="accented">kein entsuhntes Volk</span>)," but for the altar, either, as Kliefoth suggests, because, being made out of a part of the sinful earth and world, it required to be sanctified, or because, as Plumptre prefers, the sins of the people having been, as it were, transferred to it, it stood in need of cleansing. </body></html>
