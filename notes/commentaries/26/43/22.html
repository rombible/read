When Christ crucified, and the things freely given to us of God, through Him, are shown to us by the Holy Ghost, they make us ashamed for our sins. This frame of mind prepares us for fuller discoveries of the mysteries of redeeming love; and the whole of the Scriptures should be opened and applied, that men may see their sins, and repent of them. We are not now to offer any atoning sacrifices, for by one offering Christ has perfected for ever those that are sanctified, Heb 10:14; but the sprinkling of his blood is needful in all our approaches to God the Father. Our best services can be accepted only as sprinkled with the blood which cleanses from all sin.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/43.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>They shall cleanse - By sprinkling the blood <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-18.htm">Ezekiel 43:18</a>.

The substitution of a "he-goat," the offering for a ruler who sins (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-23.htm">Leviticus 4:23, 24</a>), instead of a "young bullock," which formed the first day's offering, was a deviation from the ritual prescribed for the consecration of the Mosaic altar and priesthood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/29-36.htm">Exodus 29:36</a>). The object of the offering of the "he-goat" was the same as that of the offering of the "bullock," viz. <span class="cmt_word">to cleanse the altar</span>; not, however, as if the previous day's cleansing had been insufficient and required to be supplemented, or had already become inefficient so as to call for renewal, but in the sense of recalling the meaning and impression of the previous day's ceremonial, and so in a manner linking it on with the several rites of the succeeding days. </body></html>
