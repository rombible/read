The measuring angel conducts the prophet still farther to the porch of the temple, and measures its breadth and length. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>. And he led me to the porch of the house, and measured the pillar of the porch, five cubits on this side and five cubits on that side; and the breadth of the gate, three cubits on this side and three cubits on that side. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>. The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits, and that by the steps by which one went up; and columns were by the pillars, one on this side and one on that side. - &#1492;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; is the temple in the more restricted sense of the word, the temple-house, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-2.htm">1 Kings 6:2</a>, etc.; and &#1488;&#1500;&#1501;, the porch before the entrance into the holy place (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a>). The measurements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>, which are apparently irreconcilable with one another, led the lxx to the adoption of arbitrary interpolations and conjectures in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a>, in accordance with which Bttcher, Hitzig, and others have made corrections in the text, which have a plausible justification in the many artificial and for the most part mistaken interpretations that have been given of the text. The measures in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> are perfectly plain, namely, the length of the porch twenty cubits, and the breadth eleven cubits; and there is no question that these measurements are to be understood in the clear, that is to say, as referring to the internal space, excluding the side-walls, as in the case of the holy place, the most holy place, and the inner court. The only question is whether the length signifies the dimension from east to west, i.e., the distance which had to be traversed on entering the temple, and therefore the breadth, the extent from north to south; or whether we are to understand by the length the larger dimension, and by the breadth the smaller, in which case the measurement from north to south, which formed the breadth of the house, would be designated the length of the porch, and that from east to west the breadth. Nearly all the commentators have decided in favour of the latter view, because, in the porch of Solomon's temple, the length of twenty cubits was measured according to the breadth of the house. But the fact has been overlooked, that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-3.htm">1 Kings 6:3</a> the length given is more precisely defined by the clause, "in front of the breadth of the house." There is no such definition here, and the analogy of the building of Solomon's temple is not sufficient in itself to warrant our regarding the construction of the porch in the temple seen by Ezekiel as being precisely the same; since it was only in the essential portions, the form of which was of symbolical significance (the holy place and the most holy), that this picture of a temple resembled the temple of Solomon, whereas in those which were less essential it differed from that temple in various ways. At the very outset, therefore, the more probable assumption appears to be, that just as in the case of the holy place and the holy of holies, so also in that of the porch, we are to understand by the length, the distance to be traversed (from east to west), and by the breadth, the extension on either side (i.e., from south to north).<p>If, then, we understand the measurements in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-49.htm">Ezekiel 40:49</a> in this way, the measures given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> may also be explained without any alterations in the text. The measuring of the pillar of the porch on either side, and of the gate on this side and that (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>), is sufficient of itself to lead to the conclusion that the front turned toward a person entering is the breadth from south to north. This breadth presented to the eye a pillar on this side and one on that - two pillars, therefore, each five cubits broad (c c), and a breadth of gate of three cubits on this side and three on that, six cubits in all (b), that is to say, a total breadth (k-k) of 5 + 3 + 3 + 5  equals  16 cubits. The only thing that can surprise one here is the manner in which the breadth of the gate is defined: three cubits on this side and that, instead of simply six cubits. But the only reason in all probability is, that the pillars on either side are mentioned just before, and the gate of six cubits' breadth consisted of two halves, which had their hinges fastened to the adjoining pillars, so that each half was measured by itself from the pillar to which it was attached. The breadth of front mentioned, viz., sixteen cubits, agrees very well with the breadth of the porch inside, i.e., eleven cubits (m-m), for it allows a thickness of two cubits and a half for each side wall (a), and this was sufficient for the walls of a porch. The pillars, which were five cubits broad on the outer face, were therefore only half that breadth (2 1/2 cubits) in the inner side within the porch, the other two cubits and a half forming the side wall. All the particulars given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a> may be explained in this way without any artifice, and yield a result the proportions of which are in harmony with those of the entire building. For the porch, with an external breadth of sixteen cubits, was half as broad as the house, which had a breadth of twenty cubits in the clear, and side walls of six cubits in thickness (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-5.htm">Ezekiel 41:5</a>), so that when measured on the outside it was 6 + 20 + 6  equals  32 cubits broad. The breadth of the interior also is apparently perfectly appropriate, as the porch was not intended either for the reception of vessels or for the abode of individuals, but was a simple erection in front of the entrance into the holy place, the door of which (d) was ten cubits broad (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-2.htm">Ezekiel 41:2</a>), that is to say, half a cubit narrower on either side than the porch-way leading to it. And lastly, the length of the porch was also in good proportion to the holy place, which followed the porch; the porch being twenty cubits long, and the holy place forty cubits. If we add to this the front wall, with a thickness of two cubits and a half, corresponding to that of the side walls, we obtain an external length of twenty-two cubits and a half for the porch. In front were the steps by which one went up to the porch (l). It is generally supposed that there were ten steps, the &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; after &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; being changed into &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512; (ten) after the example of the lxx. But however this alteration may commend itself when the facts of the case are considered, ten steps in front of the porch answering very well to the eight steps before the gateway of the inner court, and to the seven steps in front of the gateway of the outer court, it is not absolutely necessary, and in all probability is merely a conjecture of the Seventy, who did not know what to do with &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, and possibly it is not even correct (see at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a>). The words &#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1502;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; can be attached without difficulty to the preceding account of the breadth: "the breadth was eleven cubits, and that at the steps by which they went up to it," i.e., when measured on the side on which the flight of steps stood. If the words are taken in this way, they serve to remove all doubt as to the side which is designated as the breadth, with special reference to the fact that the porch of Solomon's temple was constructed in a different manner. The number of steps, therefore, is not given, as was also the case with the east gate of the outer court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>), because it was of no essential importance in relation to the entire building. The last statement, "and there were columns by the pillars on this side and on that," is free from difficulty, although there is also a difference of opinion among the commentators as to the position of these columns. &#1492;&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501; points back to &#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1500;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-48.htm">Ezekiel 40:48</a>). The preposition &#1488;&#1500; does not imply that the columns stood close to the pillars, and had the form of half-columns, but simply that they stood near the pillars (see Plate III K), like the columns Jachin and Boaz in Solomon's temple, to which they correspond. </body></html>
