The following is the description of the north gate. -  <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a>. And the gate, whose direction was toward the north, touching the outer court, he measured its length and its breadth, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>. And its guard-rooms, three on this side and three on that, and its pillars and its wall-projections. It was according to the measure of the first gate, fifty cubits its length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. And its windows and its wall-projections and its palms were according to the measure of the gate, whose direction was toward the east; and by seven steps they went up, and its wall-projections were in front of it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>. And a gate to the inner court was opposite the gate to the north and to the east; and he measured from gate to gate a hundred cubits. - With the measuring of the breadth of the court the measuring man had reached the north gate, which he also proceeded to measure now. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-20.htm">Ezekiel 40:20</a> the words &#1493;&#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; to &#1492;&#1495;&#1497;&#1510;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492; are written absolutely; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a> the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; does not belong to the objects previously enumerated, viz., guard-rooms, pillars, etc., but these objects are governed by &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491; yb denrevog e, and &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; points back to the principal subject of the two verses, &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;: it (the gate) was according to the measure... (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-15.htm">Ezekiel 40:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-13.htm">Ezekiel 40:13</a>). For the use of &#1489; in definitions of measurement, "25 &#1489;&#1468;&#1488;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;" (by the cubit, sc. measured), as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/27-18.htm">Exodus 27:18</a>, etc., see Gesenius, 120. 4, Anm. 2. The "first gate" is the east gate, the one first measured and described. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> the number of steps is given which the flight leading into the gateway had; and this of course applies to the flight of steps of the east gate also (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm">Ezekiel 40:6</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1491;&#1468;&#1514; is not to be regarded as doubtful, as Hitzig supposes, or changed into &#1499;&#1468;; for even if the windows of the east gate were not measured, they had at all events a definite measurement, so that it might be affirmed with regard to the windows of the north gate that their dimensions were the same. This also applies to the palm-decorations. With regard to the &#1488;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>), however, it is simply stated that they were measured; but the measurement is not given. &#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>, end) is not to be altered in an arbitrary and ungrammatical way into &#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492;, as Bttcher proposes. The suffix &#1492;&#1501; refers to the steps. Before the steps there were the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate-building. This "before," however, is not equivalent to "outside the flight of steps," as Bttcher imagines; for the measuring man did not go out of the inside of the gate, or go down the steps into the court, but came from the court and ascended the steps, and as he was going up he saw in front (vis--vis) of the steps the &#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; of the gate, i.e., the wall-projections on both sides of the threshold of the gate. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a> it is observed for the first time that there was a gate to the inner court opposite to the northern and the eastern gate of the outer court already described, so that the gates of the outer and inner court stood vis--vis. The distance between these outer and inner gates is then measured, viz., 100 cubits, in harmony with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24-27</a> the south gate is described with the same brevity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-24.htm">Ezekiel 40:24</a>. And he led me toward the south, and behold there was a gate toward the south, and he measured its pillars and its wall-projections according to the same measures. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>. And there were windows in it and its wall-projections round about like those windows; fifty cubits was the length, and the breadth five and twenty cubits. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>. And seven steps were its ascent and its wall-projections in the front of them, and it had palm-work, one upon this side and one upon that on its pillars. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>. And there was a gate to the inner court toward the south, and he measured from gate to gate toward the south a hundred cubits. - This gate also was built exactly like the two others. The description simply differs in form, and not in substance, from the description of the gate immediately preceding. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;, "like those measures," is a concise expression for "like the measures of the pillars already described at the north and east gates." For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-25.htm">Ezekiel 40:25</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-21.htm">Ezekiel 40:21</a>; and for <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a>, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-22.htm">Ezekiel 40:22</a>. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-26.htm">Ezekiel 40:26</a> is clearly explained from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-16.htm">Ezekiel 40:16</a>, as compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-9.htm">Ezekiel 40:9</a>. And lastly, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> answers to the 23rd verse, and completes the measuring of the breadth of the court, which was also a hundred cubits upon the south side, from the outer gate to the inner gate standing opposite, as was the case according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a> upon the eastern side. Hvernick has given a different explanation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, and would take the measurement of a hundred cubits as referring to the distance between the gates of the inner court which stood opposite to each other, because in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a> we have &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in the text, and not &#1502;&#1503; &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512;; so that we should have to render the passage thus, "he measured from a gate to the gate toward the south a hundred cubits," and not "from the gate (already described) of the outer court," but from another gate, which according to the context of the verse must also be a gate of the inner court. But it is precisely the context which speaks decidedly against this explanation. For since, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-18.htm">Ezekiel 40:18</a>, the measuring man did not take the prophet into the inner court, for the purpose of measuring it before his eyes, till after he had measured from (a) gate to the south gate of the inner court, the distance which he had previously measured and found to be a hundred cubits is not to be sought for within the inner court, and therefore cannot give the distance between the gates of the inner court, which stood opposite to one another, but must be that from the south gate of the outer court to the south gate of the inner. This is the case not only here, but also in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where the north gate is mentioned. We may see how little importance is to be attached to the omission of the article in &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; from the expression &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; &#1488;&#1500; &#1513;&#1473;&#1506;&#1512; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, where neither the one gate nor the other is defined, because the context showed which gates were meant. Hvernick's explanation is therefore untenable, notwithstanding the fact that, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a>, the size of the inner court was a hundred cubits both in breadth and length. - From the distance between the gates of the outer court and the corresponding gates of the inner, as given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-27.htm">Ezekiel 40:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-23.htm">Ezekiel 40:23</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-19.htm">Ezekiel 40:19</a>, we find that the outer court covered a space of two hundred cubits on every side, - namely, fifty cubits the distance which the outer court building projected into the court, and fifty cubits for the projection of the gate-building of the inner court into the outer court, and a hundred cubits from one gate-porch to the opposite one (50 + 50 + 100  equals  200).<p>Consequently the full size of the building enclosed by the wall (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-5.htm">Ezekiel 40:5</a>), i.e., of the temple with its two courts, may also be calculated, as it has been by many of the expositors. If we proceed, for example, from the outer north gate to the outer south gate upon the ground plan (Plate I), we have, to quote the words of Kliefoth, "first the northern breadth of the outer court (D) with its two hundred cubits; then the inner court, which measured a hundred cubits square according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-47.htm">Ezekiel 40:47</a> (E), with its hundred cubits; and lastly, the south side of the outer court with two hundred cubits more (D); so that the sanctuary was five hundred cubits broad from north to south. And if we start from the entrance of the east gate of the court (A), we have first of all the eastern breadth of the outer court, viz., two hundred cubits; then the inner court (e) with its hundred cubits; after that the temple-buildings, which also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, including the open space around them (G), with another hundred cubits; and lastly, the &#1490;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1492; (J), which was situated to the west of the temple-buildings, and also covered a space of a hundred cubits square according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-13.htm">Ezekiel 41:13-14</a>, with another hundred cubits; so that the sanctuary was also five hundred cubits long from east to west, or, in other words, formed a square of five hundred cubits." </body></html>
