True prophetesses, as in the case of Miriam (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-20.htm" title="And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand; and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dances.">Exodus 15:20</a>), Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/4-4.htm" title="And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged Israel at that time.">Judges 4:4</a>), and, at this very time, Huldah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm" title="So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.">2Kings 22:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm" title="And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath, the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college:) and they spoke to her to that effect.">2Chronicles 34:22</a>), and somewhat later, Noadiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm" title="My God, think you on Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.">Nehemiah 6:14</a>), are frequently spoken of, and continued to exist in New Testament times, as in the case of Anna (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm" title="And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Aser: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;">Luke 2:36</a>). It was naturally to be expected that as false prophets dogged the steps of the true, the same thing would happen with the other sex, and we find express mention of a false prophetess in <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>. Their course, in prophesying “out of their own heart” deceiving the people, was essentially the same as that of the false prophets; but they are described as doing this in ways suited to their sex. Of the general meaning of this description there can be no doubt; but it is difficult to follow it with certainty in the details, because of the occurrence of some words of uncertain meaning, found nowhere else, and of some others in an unusual sense. Without attempting a discussion of each single word, (which would be useless except with a careful examination of the original), the following is given as the most probable translation of <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-18.htm" title="And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?">Ezekiel 13:18-21</a>; but it is to be remembered that several of the words, like the similar ones in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/3-16.htm" title="Moreover the LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet:">Isaiah 3:16-24</a>, are so uncertain that there is a difference of opinion in regard to their exact meaning :—“Woe to those who fasten charms on every finger-joint, that place kerchiefs on heads of every height to snare souls. Will ye snare the souls of my people, and keep your own souls alive? (19) And will ye profane me with my people for handfuls of barley, and for pieces of bread, to slay souls that should not die, and to make live souls that should not live, by your lying to my people who hearken to a lie? (20) Therefore, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I am against your charms, when ye snare the souls like birds, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, the souls that ye are snaring like birds. (21) Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be snared; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.” (<span class= "ital">See Excursus 8 </span>at the end of this book, on <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-6.htm" title="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.">Ezekiel 13:6-7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-14.htm" title="So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the middle thereof: and you shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 13:14</a>.)<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/13.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-17.htm" title="Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,...">Ezekiel 13:17-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Likewise, set thy face against the daughters of thy people — </span>Direct thy discourse against the female pretenders to prophecy.

This encouraged others of that sex to pretend to the same gift: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm" title="Notwithstanding I have a few things against you, because you suffer that woman Jezebel, which calls herself a prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.">Revelation 2:20</a>. <span class="ital">Wo to the women that sew pillows, </span>&c. — As the prophet compares the deceitful practices of the false prophets to the daubing of a wall, so he represents the artifices of these female seducers by sewing pillows under the hearers’ arms, that they might rest securely in their evil ways. “The eastern mode of sitting,” says Harmer, chap. 6. observ. 35, “supported by pillows, explains this representation of Ezekiel. Dr. Russel has given us a print representing a fine eastern lady reposing herself on one of these bolsters, or pillows, by leaning with one of her arms on one of them, while she is smoking.” In Barbary and the Levant they “always cover the floors of their houses with carpets; and along the sides of the wall, or floor, a range of narrow beds, or mattresses, is often placed upon these carpets; and, for their further ease and convenience, several velvet or damask bolsters are placed upon these carpets or mattresses: indulgences that seem to be alluded to by the <span class="ital">stretching of themselves upon couches, </span>and by the sewing of pillows to arm-holes.” — Shaw’s <span class="ital">Travels, </span>p. 209, second edition. Sir John Chardin also mentions “a mattress, with large cushions, placed at the back and sides” of the person who uses it as a bed, Harm., vol. 2., chap. 6. observ. 46. See also, to the same purpose, Lady M. W. Montague’s description of a Turkish lady’s apartment, let. 32, vol. 2. p. 55. <span class="ital">And make kerchiefs upon the head of every stature — </span>Rather, <span class="ital">Upon every head, </span><span class="greekheb">כל ראשׁ</span>, <span class="ital">of every stature, </span>the false prophetess doing this without distinction of stature or age. “This,” says Bishop Newcome, “may be a strong, eastern manner of expressing that these women <span class="ital">hoodwinked </span>their votaries, and kept them in spiritual darkness.” In the same light the passage is considered by Lowth and many others. “Or the covering of the head may have been of the ornamental kind, to denote prosperity or victory, as pillows denoted tranquillity and plenty; and both may have been significantly applied to the heads and arms of those who consulted the prophetesses.” Thus we are told by Dr. Shaw, p. 221, and Lady M. W. Montague, vol. 2. p. 30, that the eastern women bind on their other ornaments for the head with a handkerchief, which the latter calls “a rich embroidered handkerchief.” These prophetesses, therefore, Harmer thinks, “did the same thing by their flattering words, as would have been best expressed, if they had thought fit to signify the same thing by actions only, (as the prophets sometimes did,) by making bolsters for the arms, and presenting them to the Israelitish women, whom they wanted to assure of the continuance of their prosperity; and embroidering handkerchiefs, proper to bind over the ornaments of females in a state of honour, and afterward putting them on their heads. Whereas, the true prophets of God gave them to understand, in direct contradiction to all this, that if the Jews would not yield up themselves to the Chaldeans, great numbers of their men should perish, and their women should be brought down from those elevated places in which they sat supported by rich bolsters, and should be forced to sit on the ground; and, instead of a rich attire for their heads, should have their hair miserably dishevelled, strongly marking out grief in a despairing neglect of their persons. Such is the description Isaiah gives of the state of captives, (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/47-1.htm" title="Afterward he brought me again to the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar....">Ezekiel 47:1-2</a>,) which every one must see is just the reverse of what these prophetesses are represented as doing: <span class="ital">Come down and sit in the dust, </span>&c.” — Harmer, chap. 6., observ. 35.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">To hunt souls — </span>To allure, draw, or drive men into those nets and snares that they have laid for them, and thereby to make them their prey. Or to destroy men, to expose them to the divine vengeance, by lulling them into security, and enticing them to commit sin in following their directions. <span class="ital">Will ye hunt the souls of my people? — </span>Will ye make a prey of men’s souls by deluding them with fair promises and vain hopes? Will ye draw my people into destruction, by promising them safety and happiness, while they continue in sin? “This verse,” says Secker, “should seem to mean, that these women made every body easy to their ruin, for their own profit.” <span class="ital">Will ye pollute me among my people? — </span>Will ye profane my name, by making use of it to give credit to your own dreams and lies? Or, Will ye dishonour it by employing it to the vilest use, the encouraging of wickedness, and the discouraging of piety and virtue? <span class="ital">For handfuls of barley, </span>&c. — For the sake of gain to yourselves, even for the meanest presents? It is well known how customary gifts were, and still are, in the East. These false prophets and prophetesses being chiefly, if not solely, consulted by the corrupt and wicked part of the Jews, who made them presents for their answers; and those presents being generally the larger the more agreeable the answers were, therefore these prophets and prophetesses always uttered what was pleasing, and gave encouragement to the wicked, and what tended to disgrace and discourage the truly good. <span class="ital">To slay the souls that should not die — </span>To denounce or prophesy death and destruction to those that shall be preserved. Thus they denounced death to those who yielded themselves to the Chaldeans in Jeconiah’s captivity, whom God had determined to preserve alive, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/29-5.htm" title="Build you houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them;...">Jeremiah 29:5-6</a>. And they encouraged those who remained at Jerusalem, with promises of peace and safety, who, God had foretold, should perish: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm" title="A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.">Ezekiel 5:12</a>. Or the words may be understood, in a more general sense, of discouraging the godly, and confirming the wicked in their evil ways: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-22.htm" title="Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:">Ezekiel 13:22</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-17.htm" title="They say still to them that despise me, The LORD has said, You shall have peace; and they say to every one that walks after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come on you.">Jeremiah 23:17</a>.

Their prophesying was by some species of divination, which they used in order to obtain oracles. The methods of divination practised are somewhat obscure: they bound fillets upon the joints and threw cloths or veils over the heads of those who consulted them.

The section which follows (vers. 17-23) throws an interesting side light on the position of women in the religious life of Israel. For good as for evil, their influence was stronger there than in most other nations. Miriam had led the way (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-21.htm">Exodus 15:21</a>), and had been followed by Deborah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/5-4.htm">Judges 5:4</a>). Huldah had been almost as prominent in Josiah's reformation as Hilkiah the high priest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/22-14.htm">2 Kings 22:14-20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/34-22.htm">2 Chronicles 34:22</a>). It was but natural that there should be women on the other side also, guiding their own sex; and it is probable that Ezekiel had in his thoughts some special leaders who headed the women of Jerusalem in their opposition to Jeremiah, as afterwards at Pathros (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-15.htm">Jeremiah 44:15</a>). So, later on, we have the prophetess Noadiah heading the opposition to Nehemiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/6-14.htm">Nehemiah 6:14</a>); and in the New Testament, on the one hand, Anns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/2-36.htm">Luke 2:36</a>) and the daughters of Philip (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/21-9.htm">Acts 21:9</a>), and on the other, the ill-regulated prophetesses of Corinth (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/11-5.htm">1 Corinthians 11:5</a>) and the woman Jezebel, who called herself a prophetess (<a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/2-20.htm">Revelation 2:20</a>). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/13.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Against the False Prophets<p>Their conduct. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-1.htm">Ezekiel 13:1</a>.

Ezekiel is not to direct his words against the prophets as a body, but against those who follow the vocation of prophet in Israel without being called to it by God on receiving a divine revelation, but simply prophesying out of their own heart, or according to their own subjective imagination. In the name of the Lord he is to threaten them with woes, as fools who follow their own spirit; in connection with which we must bear in mind that folly, according to the Hebrew idea, was not merely a moral failing, but actual godlessness (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/14-1.htm">Psalm 14:1</a>). The phrase "going after their spirit" is interpreted and rendered more emphatic by &#1500;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, which is to be taken as a relative clause, "that which they have not seen," i.e., whose prophesying does not rest upon intuition inspired by God. Consequently they cannot promote the welfare of the nation, but (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-4.htm">Ezekiel 13:4</a>) are like foxes in ruins or desolate places. The point of comparison is to be found in the undermining of the ground by foxes, qui per cuniculos subjectam terram excavant et suffodiunt (Bochart). For the thought it not exhausted by the circumstance that they withdraw to their holes instead of standing in front of the breach (Hitzig); and there is no force in the objection that, with this explanation, &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is passed over and becomes in fact tautological (Hvernick). The expression "in ruins" points to the fall of the theocracy, which the false prophets cannot prevent, but, on the contrary, accelerate by undermining the moral foundations of the state. For (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-5.htm">Ezekiel 13:5</a>) they do not stand in the breaches, and do not build up the wall around the house of Israel (&#1500;&#1488; belongs to both clauses). He who desires to keep off the enemy, and prevent his entering the fortress, will stand in the breach. For the same purpose are gaps and breaches in the fortifications carefully built up. The sins of the people had made gaps and breaches in the walls of Jerusalem; in other words, had caused the moral decay of the city. But they had not stood in the way of this decay and its causes, as the calling and duty of prophets demanded, by reproving the sins of the people, that they might rescue the people and kingdom from destruction by restoring its moral and religious life. &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, to stand, or keep ground, i.e., so that ye might have kept your ground in the war. The subject is the false prophets, not Israel, as Hvernick supposes. "In the day of Jehovah," i.e., in the judgment which Jehovah has decreed. Not to stand, does not mean merely to avert the threatening judgment, but not to survive the judgment itself, to be overthrown by it. This arises from the fact that their prophesying is a life; because Jehovah, whose name they have in their mouths, has not sent them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-6.htm">Ezekiel 13:6</a>). &#1493;&#1497;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is dependent upon &#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;: God has not sent them, so that they could hope for the fulfilment of the word which they speak.The rendering adopted by others, "and they cause to hope," is untenable; for &#1497;&#1495;&#1500; with &#1500; does not mean "to cause to hope," or give hope, but simply to hope for anything. This was really the case; and it is affirmed in the declaration, which is repeated in the form of a direct appeal in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-7.htm">Ezekiel 13:7</a>, to the effect that their visions were vain and lying soothsaying. For this they are threatened with the judgment described in the verses which follow. </body></html>
