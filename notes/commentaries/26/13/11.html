The figure of this prophecy may be compared with the parable of <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/7-27.htm" title="And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat on that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.">Matthew 7:27</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>13:10-16 One false prophet built the wall, set up the notion that Jerusalem should be victorious, and made himself acceptable by it. Others made the matter yet more plausible and promising; they daubed the wall which the first had built; but they would, ere long, be undeceived when their work was beaten down by the storm of God's just wrath; when the Chaldean army desolated the land. Hopes of peace and happiness, not warranted by the word of God, will cheat men; like a wall well daubed, but ill built.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/13.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Wall - A partition wall; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-12.htm">Ezekiel 13:12</a>, the word used is the usual word for the outer wall of a house or city.

The three most destructive agents shall co-operate against the wall&#8212;wind, rain, and hailstones. These last in the East are more out of the regular course of nature and are therefore often particularly specified as the instruments of God's displeasure against His foes (Ex 9:18; Jos 10:11; Job 38:22; Ps 18:12, 13; Isa 28:2; 30:30; Re 16:21). The Hebrew here is, literally, "stones of ice." They fall in Palestine at times an inch thick with a destructive velocity. The personification heightens the vivid effect, "O ye hail stones." The Chaldeans will be the violent agency whereby God will unmask and refute them, overthrowing their edifice of lies.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Unto them; </span> the meaner and less noted, who follow the arch false prophets, and are as under-workers in this wall. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">It shall fall; </span> most certainly its fall shall be the shame and loss of the builders, and those that hoped its duration. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">An overflowing shower; </span> abundant, violent, and continued showers shall soak into your wall and dissolve the cement; and this shower is the Babylonish invasion, which all your provision shall be no more able to withstand, than mire in a wall can keep the stones together when drenched with showers.

And when the disaster comes men will turn to those who professed to be master builders and repairers of the breach, with derision, and ask, "Where is the daubing wherewith ye have daubed?" And then men shall see that through all this it is Jehovah's hand that has been working. It is he who "rends" the wall; he who "brings it down to the ground;" he who "accomplishes his wrath" (vers. 13-15).

Some altogether denied that the prophecies would ever be fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>); others, who did not go so far as this, thought that it would be a long time before they came to pass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>). These doubts were fed by the lying statements of false prophets. For this reason the refutation of these sceptical opinions (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21-28</a>) is followed in the next chapter by a stern reproof of the false prophets and prophetesses who led the people astray. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>. Son of man, what kind of proverb have ye in the land of Israel, that ye say, The days become long, and every prophecy comes to nothing? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-23.htm">Ezekiel 12:23</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will put an end to this saying, and they shall say it no more in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the word of every prophecy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. For henceforth there shall be no vain prophecy and flattering soothsaying in the midst of the house of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. For I am Jehovah; I speak; the word which I speak will come to pass, and no longer be postponed; for in your days, O refractory generation, I speak a word and do it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. -  Ma&#770;sha&#770;l, a proverb, saying current among the people, and constantly repeated as a truth. "The days become long," etc., i.e., the time is lengthening out, and yet the prophecy is not being fulfilled. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, perire, to come to nothing, to fail of fulfilment, is the opposite of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to come, to be fulfilled. God will put an end to these sayings, by causing a very speedy fulfilment of the prophecy. The days are near, and every word of the prophecy, i.e., the days in which every word predicted shall come to pass. The reason for this is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>, in two co-ordinate sentences, both of which are introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. First, every false prophecy shall henceforth cease in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>); secondly, God will bring about the fulfilment of His own word, and that without delay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>). Different explanations have been given of the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. Kliefoth proposes to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; as the predicate to &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;: no prophecy in Israel shall be vain and flattering soothsaying, but all prophecy shall become true, i.e., be fulfilled. Such an explanation, however, is not only artificial and unnatural, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; would be inserted as a predicate in a most unsuitable manner, but it contains this incongruity, that God would apply the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501;, soothsaying, to the predictions of prophets inspired by Himself. On the other hand, there is no force in the objection raised by Kliefoth to the ordinary rendering of the words, namely, that the statement that God was about to put an end to false prophecy in Israel would anticipate the substance of the sixth word of God (i.e., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>). It is impossible to see why a thought should not be expressed here, and then still further expanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, smooth, i.e., flattering (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>; and for the prediction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4-5</a>). The same reply serves also to overthrow the sceptical objection raised by the frivolous despisers of the prophet's words. Hence there is only a brief allusion made to them in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26-28</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel saith, The vision that he seeth is for many days off, and he prophesies for distant times. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, All my words shall be no longer postponed: the word which I shall speak shall come to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah. - The words are plain; and after what has already been said, they need no special explanation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a> compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. </body></html>
