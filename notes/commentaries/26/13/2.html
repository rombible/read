The people wished to be deceived, and so were deceived. They were inexcusable, for they had among them true prophets (who spoke not their own thoughts, but as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, 2Pe 1:21), whom they might have known to be such, but they did not wish to know (Joh 3:19).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Prophesy; </span> declare aforehand what I will do. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Against the prophets; </span> against prince and people first, next against prophets and prophetesses; against the former in the foregoing chapters, against the latter in this chapter. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Of Israel, </span> because approved of Israel, encouraged by Israel, and followed; but not prophets of the Lord, he sent them not.

And the inhabited cities become desolate, and the land will be laid waste; that ye may learn that I am Jehovah. - The carrying out of this sign is not mentioned; not that there is any doubt as to its having been done, but that it is simply taken for granted. The trouble and trembling could only be expressed by means of gesture. &#1512;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;, generally an earthquake or violent convulsion; here, simply shaking, synonymous with &#1512;&#1490;&#1494;&#1492;, trembling. "Bread and water" is the standing expression for food; so that even here the idea of scanty provisions is not to be sought therein. This idea is found merely in the signs of anxiety and trouble with which Ezekiel was to eat his food. &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1502;&#1514;  equals  '&#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;, "upon the land," equivalent to "in the land."
