A true prophet (like Ezekiel) spoke "the word of the Lord," and declared what he had seen "in the visions of God."

A threefold distinction lay between the false and the true prophets: (1) The source of their messages respectively; of the false, "their own hearts"; of the true, an object presented to the spiritual sense (named from the noblest of the senses, a seeing) by the Spirit of God as from without, not produced by their own natural powers of reflection. The word, the body of the thought, presented itself not audibly to the natural sense, but directly to the spirit of the prophet; and so the perception of it is properly called a seeing, he perceiving that which thereafter forms itself in his soul as the cover of the external word [Delitzsch]; hence the peculiar expression, "seeing the word of God" (Isa 2:1; 13:1; Am 1:1; Mic 1:1). (2) The point aimed at; the false "walking after their own spirit"; the true, after the Spirit of God. (3) The result; the false saw nothing, but spake as if they had seen; the true had a vision, not subjective, but objectively real [Fairbairn]. A refutation of those who set the inward word above the objective, and represent the Bible as flowing subjectively from the inner light of its writers, not from the revelation of the Holy Ghost from without. "They are impatient to get possession of the kernel without its fostering shell&#8212;they would have Christ without the Bible" [Bengel].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/13.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> They shall be doubly miserable, suffering with the deceived, and suffering by the enraged, when their lies are detected. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Foolish prophets; </span> either in a moral sense, i. e. wicked; or in a literal sense, unwise.

Jeremiah charges the prophets of his day with shameful vices, “They commit adultery with their neighbours’ wives” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-23.htm" title="Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, said the LORD.">Jeremiah 29:23</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-14.htm" title="I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem an horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evildoers, that none does return from his wickedness; they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.">Jeremiah 23:14</a>, and <span class="ital">pass</span>.); but, without supposing that all the “false” prophets were so bad, it characterized them in general that they were superficial men in a moral sense. Their notions of religion and life were not high or strict, and hence they saw nothing in the condition of the people or the state calling for the judgment of God, and prophesied “peace.” This was what distinguished them from Jeremiah and other prophets whom we call “true.” Micah says in opposition to them: “I am full of power by the spirit of the Lord to declare unto Jacob his transgression and to Israel his sin” (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-8.htm" title="Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.">Ezekiel 3:8</a>); and Jeremiah goes so far as to declare it to be the mark of a true prophet that he threatens judgment upon the nation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/28-8.htm" title="The prophets that have been before me and before you of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence....">Jeremiah 28:8-9</a>). A true prophet is one by whom the Lord speaks, and a “false” prophet (the expression is not used in the Old Testament, though the prophets are said to speak “falsely”) is one by whom he does not speak. This is true: but the converse has also its truth—the Lord did not speak by these prophets because they were “false” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-6.htm" title="Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up; for the LORD shall deliver it into the hand of the king.">1 Kings 22:6</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.). There is a spirit of false prophecy as well as a spirit of true prophecy. The spirit of true prophecy is the spirit of the theocracy and of the religion of Jehovah, the spirit that comprehends its principles, sympathises with its lofty morality, understands its aims, and therefore can perceive the true means to be used for fulfilling them. The spirit of false prophecy is the untheocratic spirit, which, even when speaking in the name of Jehovah, has not entered with any profoundness into the nature and aims of his kingdom, and consequently misapprehends the means needful to further it. In his encounters with the prophets of his day Jeremiah opposes them in three spheres: that of policy; that of morals; and that of personal experience. In policy the genuine prophets had some fixed principles, all arising out of the idea that the kingdom of the Lord was not a kingdom of this world. Hence they opposed military preparation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/20-7.htm" title="Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will remember the name of the LORD our God.">Psalm 20:7</a>), riding on horses and building of fenced cities (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/14-3.htm" title="Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride on horses: neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, You are our gods: for in you the fatherless finds mercy.">Hosea 14:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/micah/5-10.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, said the LORD, that I will cut off your horses out of the middle of you, and I will destroy your chariots:...">Micah 5:10-11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/31-1.htm" title="Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!">Isaiah 31:1</a>), and counselled trust in Jehovah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-9.htm" title="And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.">Isaiah 7:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/10-20.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall no more again stay on him that smote them; but shall stay on the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth....">Isaiah 10:20-21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-7.htm" title="At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel.">Isaiah 17:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/30-15.htm" title="For thus said the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In returning and rest shall you be saved; in quietness and in confidence shall be your strength: and you would not.">Isaiah 30:15</a>). These prophets were moving forward (often unconsciously) towards that conception of the kingdom of God which has been realized in the “Church;” and external providence was shaping the history of the nation on lines parallel to this conception, which eventually received form by the destruction of the state and the reduction of the people to be a mere religious community. The false prophets, on the other hand, desired their country to be a military power among the powers around, they advocated alliances with the Eastern empires and with Egypt, and relied on their national strength (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-13.htm" title="You which rejoice in a thing of nothing, which say, Have we not taken to us horns by our own strength?">Amos 6:13</a>). Again, the true prophets had a stringent personal and state morality (see above). In their view the true cause of the destruction of the state was its immoralities. But the false prophets had no such deep moral convictions, and seeing nothing unwonted or alarming in the condition of things, prophesied of “peace.” They were not necessarily irreligious men, but their religion had no truer insight into the nature of the God of Israel than that of the common people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm" title="Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.">Amos 5:18</a>); hence they pointed to the Temple as the house of the Lord, which he must protect; while Jeremiah told them that they had made it “a cave of robbers,” in which they thought themselves safe after committing their crimes, and threatened it with the fate of Shiloh (Jeremiah 7, 26). And finally Jeremiah expresses his conviction that the prophets whom he opposed did not stand in the same relation to the Lord as he did; they had not his experiences of the word of the Lord, into whose counsel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-7.htm" title="Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he reveals his secret to his servants the prophets.">Amos 3:7</a>) they had not been admitted, and they were without that fellowship of mind with the mind of Jehovah which was the true source of prophecy (Jeremiah 23 <span class="ital">pass</span>.). Hence he satirizes their pretended supernatural “dreams,” and charges them from conscious want of any true prophetic word with “stealing” words from one another. Cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/13-6.htm" title="They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word....">Ezekiel 13:6-7</a></span> and ch. 14.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">their own spirit</span>] The term is used in opposition to the “spirit” of the Lord which inspired the true prophet, who is called “a man of the spirit” (<a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/9-7.htm" title="The days of visitation are come, the days of recompense are come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of your iniquity, and the great hatred.">Hosea 9:7</a>). As distinct from heart “spirit” is rather the force or power moving the prophet. In early times the prophets were the subjects of considerable excitation; and looking on them thus powerfully affected men recognised the influence of the spirit of God upon them.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">and have seen nothing</span>] Rather: and (go after) <span class="bld">that which they have not seen.</span> They did not see, though no doubt they thought they saw.
