What they delivered was not what they had seen or heard, as that is which the ministers of Christ deliver. They were not praying prophets, had no intercourse with Heaven; they contrived how to please people, not how to do them good; they stood not against sin. They flattered people into vain hopes.

So the Targum, <p>"and the stroke of my power shall be upon the false prophets, &amp;c.'' <p>The sense is, that they should feel the weight of his hand, and the lighting down of his arm with the indignation of his wrath, by inflicting punishment upon them: <p>they shall not be in the assembly of my people; shall have no place in the church of God, nor fellowship with the saints; they shall not join with them in religious worship here; but either shall be left by the righteous judgment of God to separate themselves from them, or shall be excluded their communion; and much less shall they stand in the congregation of the righteous hereafter: or, "they shall not be in the secret", or "council of my people" (g); shall not be consulted by them on any account, civil or religious; or not be let into the secret counsels of the Lord, as the Lord's people be, who are his favourites and his friends; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/25-14.htm">Psalm 25:14</a>. The Targum is, <p>"in the good secret which is hidden for my people they shall not be:'' <p>neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel; their names shall not be in the roll or register of those that return from captivity, as in Ezra it but shall die in their exile; they shall not be in the list and catalogue of the citizens of any city in the land of Israel, particularly of Jerusalem, the chief city; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; and it should appear that their names were never written in the Lamb's book of life; or that they ever were among the number of God's elect, the true and spiritual Israel of God.

The punishment is described in three steps, which form a climax. At present these prophets possess influence, they are counsellors and leaders; when Israel is a nation again upon her own land they shall have no place in the council of the people—read <span class="bld">council</span> for assembly as marg. Now they occupy a high place in the roll of citizens, and have names distinguished; then their names shall not be written in the writing (i.e. the book or register-roll) of the house of Israel; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm" title="These sought their register among those that were reckoned by genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as polluted, put from the priesthood.">Ezra 2:62</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm" title="And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:">Isaiah 4:3</a>. And finally, they shall not have a place in the land at all—Israel shall return, while they shall perish. Jeremiah had already used the same language in regard to Shemaiah, a prophet who misled the exiles, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-32.htm" title="Therefore thus said the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, said the LORD; because he has taught rebellion against the LORD.">Jeremiah 29:32</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/13.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 9.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Mine hand shall be,</span> etc. After Ezekiel's manner, the thought of ver. 6 is repeated in an altered form in vers. 7, 8. What had been a statement appears as a question to which there could be but one answer. The prophet, as it were, cross examines his rivals. Could they deny the charge? Was not every word of it true? Then, after the statement of the sin of the false prophets, comes the proclamation of the punishment. The hand of Jehovah would be upon them for evil and not for good. <span class="cmt_word">In the assembly of my people.</span> The Hebrew word indicates not a large popular gathering, but a secret council of those who deliberate together to carry out their plans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/89-7.htm">Psalm 89:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/111-1.htm">Psalm 111:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-11.htm">Jeremiah 6:11</a>). The prophets who had acted together, and been looked up to by the people as forming such a council, should lose that position of authority. The words that follow point to a yet lower degradation. They should be in the strictest sense of the word excommunicated. The city of Jerusalem, perhaps every city of Judah, had its register of citizens. In such a register were inscribed also the names of proselytes of other races (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/87-6.htm">Psalm 87:6</a>), and so men came to think of a like register as kept by the King of kings, containing the names of those who were heirs of the "life" of the true Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/32-32.htm">Exodus 32:32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/4-3.htm">Isaiah 4:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/12-1.htm">Daniel 12:1</a>). In neither of those registers, the earthly and the heavenly (but stress is probably laid upon the former), shall the false prophets find a place. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezra/2-62.htm">Ezra 2:62</a> gives an example of the use made of such registers on the return from the Captivity. One notes the contrast between the "<span class="accented">my</span> people" which recognizes Israel as still the heritage of Jehovah, and the "<span class="accented">thy</span> people" used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-11.htm">Ezekiel 3:11</a> of the rebellious house of the Captivity. For the false prophets there should be no return to the <span class="cmt_word">land of Israel</span> such as that which the prophet anticipated for the faithful and the penitent (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/37-21.htm">Ezekiel 37:21</a>; comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-13.htm">Isaiah 57:13</a>). Here there is no specific mention of the name being struck out. The prophet contemplates a new register, in which their names will never even have appeared. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/12.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Declarations to Remove all Doubt as to the Truth of the Threat<p>The scepticism of the people as to the fulfilment of these threatening prophecies, which had been made still more emphatic by signs, manifested itself in two different ways. Some altogether denied that the prophecies would ever be fulfilled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>); others, who did not go so far as this, thought that it would be a long time before they came to pass (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>). These doubts were fed by the lying statements of false prophets. For this reason the refutation of these sceptical opinions (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21-28</a>) is followed in the next chapter by a stern reproof of the false prophets and prophetesses who led the people astray. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-21.htm">Ezekiel 12:21</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-22.htm">Ezekiel 12:22</a>. Son of man, what kind of proverb have ye in the land of Israel, that ye say, The days become long, and every prophecy comes to nothing? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-23.htm">Ezekiel 12:23</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I will put an end to this saying, and they shall say it no more in Israel; but say to them, The days are near, and the word of every prophecy. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. For henceforth there shall be no vain prophecy and flattering soothsaying in the midst of the house of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. For I am Jehovah; I speak; the word which I speak will come to pass, and no longer be postponed; for in your days, O refractory generation, I speak a word and do it, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. -  Ma&#770;sha&#770;l, a proverb, saying current among the people, and constantly repeated as a truth. "The days become long," etc., i.e., the time is lengthening out, and yet the prophecy is not being fulfilled. &#1488;&#1489;&#1491;, perire, to come to nothing, to fail of fulfilment, is the opposite of &#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1488;, to come, to be fulfilled. God will put an end to these sayings, by causing a very speedy fulfilment of the prophecy. The days are near, and every word of the prophecy, i.e., the days in which every word predicted shall come to pass. The reason for this is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>, in two co-ordinate sentences, both of which are introduced with &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;. First, every false prophecy shall henceforth cease in Israel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>); secondly, God will bring about the fulfilment of His own word, and that without delay (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>). Different explanations have been given of the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-24.htm">Ezekiel 12:24</a>. Kliefoth proposes to take &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1488; and &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; as the predicate to &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503;: no prophecy in Israel shall be vain and flattering soothsaying, but all prophecy shall become true, i.e., be fulfilled. Such an explanation, however, is not only artificial and unnatural, since &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501; would be inserted as a predicate in a most unsuitable manner, but it contains this incongruity, that God would apply the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1505;&#1501;, soothsaying, to the predictions of prophets inspired by Himself. On the other hand, there is no force in the objection raised by Kliefoth to the ordinary rendering of the words, namely, that the statement that God was about to put an end to false prophecy in Israel would anticipate the substance of the sixth word of God (i.e., <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>). It is impossible to see why a thought should not be expressed here, and then still further expanded in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>. &#1495;&#1500;&#1511;, smooth, i.e., flattering (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/10-2.htm">Hosea 10:2</a>; and for the prediction, <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/13-4.htm">Zechariah 13:4-5</a>). The same reply serves also to overthrow the sceptical objection raised by the frivolous despisers of the prophet's words. Hence there is only a brief allusion made to them in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26-28</a>. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-26.htm">Ezekiel 12:26</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-27.htm">Ezekiel 12:27</a>. Son of man, behold, the house of Israel saith, The vision that he seeth is for many days off, and he prophesies for distant times. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-28.htm">Ezekiel 12:28</a>. Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, All my words shall be no longer postponed: the word which I shall speak shall come to pass, saith the Lord Jehovah. - The words are plain; and after what has already been said, they need no special explanation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-20.htm">Ezekiel 12:20</a> compare with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-25.htm">Ezekiel 12:25</a>. </body></html>
