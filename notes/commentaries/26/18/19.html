Doth not the son bear?</span>—It would be clearer to read this as a single question, “Why doth not the son, &c?<span class= "ital">” </span>It is the question proposed by the people in objection to what has been declared. To them it seemed the law of nature, the necessity of the case, the teaching of history, that the son should bear the iniquity of his father. Their ideas had not risen to the conception of man’s individual responsibility to God; to them the individual was still but a part of the nation or the family. They ask, therefore, why this universal law should now be reversed. It was not true that any law was reversed, it was only that the superior prevailed over the inferior law; but, as usual in such cases, the Divine word does not reason with the human objection, but in this and the following verse only reiterates most emphatically the law of individual responsibility.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/18.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father?

Is it not plain and undeniable, notwithstanding your fine discourse to the contrary? To be sure, we feel the truth of it in our own cases. To this cavil God makes answer in the following words, affirming that this was no otherwise so than when the son followed the example of his father’s iniquity; for that, when the son did that which was lawful and right, and kept God’s statutes, or lived a life of true piety and virtue, he should <span class="ital">surely live, </span>that is, should not be punished, or cut off, on account of the iniquity of his father. <span class="ital">The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him — </span>That is, the righteous shall receive the reward of his righteousness. <span class="ital">And the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him — </span>That is, the reward of his wickedness.

As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Why?... - Rather, "Why doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?" <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/18.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>19. Here the Jews object to the prophet's word and in their objection seem to seek a continuance of that very thing which they had originally made a matter of complaint. Therefore translate, "Wherefore doth not the son bear the iniquity of his father?" It now would seem a consolation to them to think the son might suffer for his father's misdeeds; for it would soothe their self-love to regard themselves as innocent sufferers for the guilt of others and would justify them in their present course of life, which they did not choose to abandon for a better. In reply, Ezekiel reiterates the truth of each being dealt with according to his own merits [Fairbairn]. But Grotius supports English Version, wherein the Jews contradict the prophet, "Why (sayest thou so) doth not the son (often, as in our case, though innocent) bear (that is, suffer for) the iniquity of their father?" Ezekiel replies, It is not as you say, but as I in the name of God say: "When the son hath done," &c. English Version is simpler than that of Fairbairn.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> Notwithstanding this method of the Divine justice, which renders to every one his own work, and gives to every one the fruit of his own doings, ye, proud, quarrelling, self-justifying debauchees, idolaters, adulterers, murderers, usurers, oppressors, will not see your own sins, for which you are punished, but cry you are innocent, that your fathers sinned and you suffer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father?</span> The prophet here brings in what he met with among them; still every where they insist on it that they deserved not by any sin of their own what they now suffered, and so would cast the sin and guilt on their fathers, and the rigour and severity on God, and clear themselves to all; which the prophet answers by a recapitulation of what he had more largely spoken, and avows it, that the righteous son of an unrighteous father shall live, and not die. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Kept all my statutes; </span> as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/119-44.htm" title="So shall I keep your law continually for ever and ever.">Psalm 119:44</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/18.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yet say ye, why?....

Walketh in my statutes, and keepeth my rights to execute truth; he is righteous, he shall live, is the saying of the Lord "Jehovah." - The exposition of the assertion, that God only punishes the sinner, not the innocent, commences with a picture of the righteousness which has the promise of life. The righteousness consists in the fulfilment of the commandments of the law: viz., (1) those relating to religious duties, such as the avoidance of idolatry, whether of the grosser kind, such as eating upon the mountains, i.e., observing sacrificial festivals, and therefore sacrificing to idols (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>.), or of a more refined description, e.g., lifting up the eyes to idols, to look to them, or make them the object of trust, and offer supplication to them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a>), as Israel had done, and was doing still (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>); and (2) those relating to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-14.htm">Exodus 20:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>; and for &#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/34-5.htm">Genesis 34:5</a>), and of conjugal intercourse with a wife during menstruation, which was a defilement of the marriage relation (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-18.htm">Leviticus 20:18</a>). All these sins were forbidden in the law on pain of death. To these there are appended duties to a neighbour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>.), viz., to abstain from oppressing any one (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-28.htm">Exodus 22:28</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-14.htm">Leviticus 15:14</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-17.htm">Leviticus 15:17</a>), to restore the pledge to a debtor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-25.htm">Exodus 22:25</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-6.htm">Deuteronomy 24:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-10.htm">Deuteronomy 24:10</a>.). &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is hardly to be taken in any other sense than as in apposition to &#1495;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;, "his pledge, which is debt," equivalent to his debt-pledge or security, like &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1498; &#1494;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The supposition of Hitzig, that &#1495;&#1493;&#1489; is a participle, like &#1511;&#1493;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/16-7.htm">2 Kings 16:7</a>, in the sense of debtor, is a far less natural one, and has no valid support in the free rendering of the lxx, &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd;&#x3b5;&#x3c7;&#x3c5;&#x3c1;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3bc;&#x3bf;&#768;&#x3bd; &#x3bf;&#787;&#x3c6;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bb;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;. The further duties are to avoid taking unlawful possession of the property of another (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-23.htm">Leviticus 5:23</a>); to feed the hungry, clothe the naked (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/58-5.htm">Isaiah 58:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/25-26.htm">Matthew 25:26</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/james/2-15.htm">James 2:15-16</a>); to abstain from practising usury (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-20.htm">Deuteronomy 23:20</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-24.htm">Exodus 22:24</a>) and taking interest (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm">Leviticus 25:36-37</a>); in judicial sentences, to draw back the hand from wrong, and promote judgment of truth, - a sentence in accordance with the true nature of the case (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-9.htm">Zechariah 7:9</a>); and, lastly, to walk in the statutes and rights of the Lord, - an expression which embraces, in conclusion, all that is essential to the righteousness required by the law. - This definition of the idea of true righteousness, which preserves from death and destruction, and ensures life to the possessor, is followed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>. by a discussion of the attitude which God sustains towards the sons. </body></html>
