God threatens, it must be acknowledged, <span class="ital">to visit the sins of the fathers upon the children, </span>both in the Old Testament and the New: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-5.htm" title="You shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them: for I the LORD your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;">Exodus 20:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/23-35.htm" title="That on you may come all the righteous blood shed on the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zacharias son of Barachias, whom you slew between the temple and the altar.">Matthew 23:35</a>.

And although those persons on whom this vengeance falls suffer no more than their own personal sins deserved, yet, because the sins of former generations, which they equal or outdo, make it time for God utterly to destroy them, the punishments due to the sins of many ages and generations are said to fall upon them.” — Dr. Sherlock.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:1-20 The soul that sinneth it shall die. As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Concerning the land of Israel - Rather, "in the land of Israel," i. e., upon Israel's soil, the last place where such a paganish saying should be expected.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12</a>. Say to the refractory race: Do ye not know what this is? Say, Behold, the king of Babel came to Jerusalem and took its king and its princes, and brought them to himself to Babel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>. And he took of the royal seed, and made a covenant with him, and caused him to enter into an oath; and he took the strong ones of the land: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-14.htm">Ezekiel 17:14</a>. That it might be a lowly kingdom, not to lift itself up, that he might keep his covenant, that it might stand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>. But he rebelled against him by sending his messengers to Egypt, that it might give him horses and much people. Will he prosper? will he that hath done this escape? He has broken the covenant, and should he escape? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>. As I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place of the king, who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke with him, in Babel he will die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>. And not with great army and much people will Pharaoh act with him in the war, when they cast up a rampart and build siege-towers, to cut off many souls. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>. He has despised an oath to break the covenant, and, behold, he has given his hand and done all this; he will not escape. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, As   I live, surely my oath which he has despised, and my covenant which he has broken, I will give upon his head. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-20.htm">Ezekiel 17:20</a>. I will spread out my net over him, so that he will be taken in my snare, and will bring him to Babel, and contend with him there on account of his treachery which he has been guilty of towards me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-21.htm">Ezekiel 17:21</a>. And all his fugitives in all his regiments, by the sword will they fall, and those who remain will be scattered to all winds; and ye shall see that I Jehovah have spoken it.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12-17</a> the parable in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-2.htm">Ezekiel 17:2-10</a> is interpreted; and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19-21</a> the threat contained in the parable is confirmed and still further expanded. We have an account of the carrying away of the king, i.e., Jehoiachin, and his princes to Babel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-11.htm">2 Kings 24:11</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>. The king's seed (&#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-13.htm">Ezekiel 17:13</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/41-1.htm">Jeremiah 41:1</a>  equals  &#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-14.htm">1 Kings 11:14</a>) is Jehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah, whom Nebuchadnezzar made king under the name of Zedekiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-17.htm">2 Kings 24:17</a>), and from whom he took an oath of fealty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-13.htm">2 Chronicles 36:13</a>). The strong of the land (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>), whom Nebuchadnezzar took (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;), i.e., took away to Babel, are not the heads of tribes and families (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>); but the expression is used in a wide sense for the several classes of men of wealth, who are grouped together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> under the one term &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1495; (&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), including masons, smiths, and carpenters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), whereas the heads of tribes and families are classed with the court officials (&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>) under the title &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; (princes) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12</a>. The design of these measures was to make a lowly kingdom, which could not raise itself, i.e., could not revolt, and to deprive the vassal king of the means of breaking of the covenant. the suffix attached to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; is probably to be taken as referring to &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; rather than &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, although both are admissible, and would yield precisely the same sense, inasmuch as the stability of the kingdom was dependent upon the stability of the covenant. But Zedekiah rebelled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>). The Egyptian king who was to give Zedekiah horses and much people, in other words, to come to his assistance with a powerful army of cavalry and fighting men, was Hophrah, the Apries of the Greeks, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a> (see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-19.htm">2 Kings 24:19-20</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; points back to &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>; but here it is applied to the rebellious king, and is explained in the clause '&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The answer is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a> as a word of God confirmed by a solemn oath: he shall die in Babel, the capital of the king, who placed him on the throne, and Pharaoh will not render him any effectual help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a> :59, to act with him, that is to say, assist him, come to his help. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Zedekiah, not to Pharaoh, as Ewald assumes in an inexplicable manner. For '&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; , compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21-22</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, according to which, although an Egyptian army came to the rescue of Jerusalem at the time when it was besieged by the Chaldeans, it was repulsed by the Chaldeans who marched to meet it, without having rendered any permanent assistance to the besieged.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, the main thought that breach of faith can bring no deliverance is repeated for the sake of appending the further expansion contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19-21</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, he gave his hand, i.e., as a pledge of fidelity. The oath which Zedekiah swore to the king of Babel is designated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a> as Jehovah's oath (&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;), and the covenant made with him as Jehovah's covenant, because the oath had been sworn by Jehovah, and the covenant of fidelity towards Nebuchadnezzar had thereby been made implicite with Jehovah Himself; so that the breaking of the oath and covenant became a breach of faith towards Jehovah. Consequently the very same expressions are used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>, to designate this breach of oath, which are applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a> to the treacherous apostasy of Jerusalem (Israel) from Jehovah, the covenant God. And the same expressions are used to describe the punishment as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13-14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is construed with the accusative of the thing respecting which he was to be judged, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>. Jehovah regards the treacherous revolt from Nebuchadnezzar as treachery against Himself (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;); not only because Zedekiah had sworn the oath of fidelity by Jehovah, but also from the fact that Jehovah had delivered up His people and kingdom into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, so that revolt from him really became rebellion against God. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; is nota accus., and is used in the sense of quod adtinet ad, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, his fugitives, is rendered both by the Chaldee and Syriac "his brave men," or "heroes," and is therefore identified with &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; (his chosen ones), which is the reading in some manuscripts. But neither these renderings nor the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, where &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; apparently corresponds to it, will warrant our adopting this explanation, or making any alteration in the text. The Greek versions have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; Theodoret: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Vulgate: omnes profugi ejus; and therefore they all had the reading &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, which also yields a very suitable meaning. The mention of some who remain, and who are to be scattered toward all the winds, is not at variance with the statement that all the fugitives in the wings of the army are to fall by the sword. The latter threat simply declares that no one will escape death by flight. But there is no necessity to take those who remain as being simply fighting men; and the word "all" must not be taken too literally. </body></html>
