So they thought it a hard case for a man who had been righteous the far greater part of his life, if he did at last commit iniquity, that his former righteousness should avail him nothing.

In a word, that sin and wickedness are the sole objects of God’s aversion and indignation, and holiness and righteousness of his favour and approbation.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/18.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>18:21-29 The wicked man would be saved, if he turned from his evil ways. The true penitent is a true believer. None of his former transgressions shall be mentioned unto him, but in the righteousness which he has done, as the fruit of faith and the effect of conversion, he shall surely live. The question is not whether the truly righteous ever become apostates. It is certain that many who for a time were thought to be righteous, do so, while ver. 26,27 speaks the fulness of pardoning mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it is remembered no more. In their righteousness they shall live; not for their righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, but in their righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by the Mediator. What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hope for pardon and life according to this promise! In verse 28 is the beginning and progress of repentance. True believers watch and pray, and continue to the end, and they are saved.

Their plea for saying, "The way of the Lord is not equal," was that God treated different classes in a different way. But it was really their way that was unequal, since living in sin they expected to be dealt with as if they were righteous.

Notwithstanding these plain instances, which show the equity of God in his proceedings, and vindicate his justice in the dispensations of his providence; yet such was the blindness and stupidity of these people, or rather their stubbornness, obstinacy, and impudence, that they still insisted upon it that <p>the way of the Lord is not equal; just and right; is not even, according to the rules of justice and equity; or is not ordered aright, is not steady, and firm, and consistent with himself, and the declaration of his will; a very bold and blasphemous charge, and yet the Lord condescends to reason with them about it: <p>hear now, O house of Israel; the ten tribes that were now in captivity; or the Jews that were carried captive with Jeconiah, with those that were still in Jerusalem and Judea; these are called upon to hear the Lord, what he had to say in vindication of himself from this charge, as it was but just and reasonable they should: <p>is not my way equal? plain and even, constant and uniform, according to the obvious rules of justice and truth? can any instance be given to the contrary? what is to be said to support the charge against me? bring forth your strong reasons if you cart, and prove what is asserted: <p>are not your ways unequal? it is plain they are; your actions, your course of life, are manifest deviations from my law, and from all the rules of righteousness and goodness; it is you that are in the wrong, and I in the right. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> equal.

The “way” of the Lord is the principle on which he acts, or his action on it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-8.htm" title="For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, said the LORD.">Isaiah 55:8</a>, cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm" title="Yet the children of your people say, The way of the Lord is not equal: but as for them, their way is not equal.">Ezekiel 33:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-20.htm" title="Yet you say, The way of the Lord is not equal.

The objection of the people may really have been expressed (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm" title="Yet say you, Why? does not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son has done that which is lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes, and has done them, he shall surely live.">Ezekiel 18:19</a></span>). The prophet’s principle of the freedom of the individual and his independence was a novelty running counter to cherished notions of that age, notions corroborated by much that is seen in history and life. The instance of Korah, whose children perished with him for his sin, the case of Achan, whose transgression was imputed to the whole camp, the history of Jonathan, and no doubt multitudes of instances were familiar to the people where men were treated as bodies and the individuals shared the fate of the mass though personally innocent. To us now the prophet’s principle is self-evident. Still even to us it is only a theoretical principle, and can be maintained against facts only by drawing a distinction, which the people in Israel had not yet learned to draw, between the spiritual relation of the mind to God and the external history of the individual.

If, however, he begetteth a violent son, who sheddeth blood, and doeth only one of these things, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-11.htm">Ezekiel 18:11</a>.

Giveth upon usury, and taketh interest: should he live? He shall not live! He hath done all these abominations; he shall be put to death; his blood shall be upon him. - The subject to &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-10.htm">Ezekiel 18:10</a>, is the righteous man described in the preceding verses. &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1509;, violent, literally, breaking in or through, is rendered more emphatic by the words "shedding blood" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-2.htm">Hosea 4:2</a>). We regard &#1488;&#1495; in the next clause as simply a dialectically different form of writing and pronouncing, for  &#1488;&#1498;, "only," and he doeth only one of these, the sins previously mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>.). &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491;, with a partitive &#1502;&#1503;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/4-2.htm">Leviticus 4:2</a>, where it is used in a similar connection; the form &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; is also met with in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/15-7.htm">Deuteronomy 15:7</a>. The explanation given by the Targum, "and doeth one of these to his brother," is neither warranted by the language nor commended by the sense. &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is never construed with the accusative of the person to whom anything is done; and the limitation of the words to sins against a brother is unsuitable in this connection. The next clause, &#1500;&#1488; &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492;...&#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;, which has also been variously rendered, we regard as an adversative circumstantial clause, and agree with Kliefoth in referring it to the begetter (father): "and he (the father) has not committed any of these sins." For it yields no intelligible sense to refer this clause also to the son, since &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492; cannot possibly refer to different things from the preceding &#1502;&#1488;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;, and a man cannot at the same time both do and not do the same thing. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; which follows signifies "if," as is frequently the case in the enumeration of particular precepts or cases; compare, for example, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-1.htm">Exodus 21:1</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-7.htm">Exodus 21:7</a>,<a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/21-17.htm">Exodus 21:17</a>, etc., where it is construed with the imperfect, because the allusion is to things that may occur. Here, on the contrary, it is followed by the perfect, because the sins enumerated are regarded as committed. The emphatic &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; (even) forms an antithesis to &#1488;&#1495; &#1502;&#1488;&#1495;&#1491; (&#1488;&#1498;), or rather an epanorthosis of it, inasmuch as &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1490;&#1468;&#1501; resumes and carries out still further the description of the conduct of the wicked son, which was interrupted by the circumstantial clause; and that not only in a different form, but with a gradation in the thought. The thought, for instance, is as follows: the violent son of a righteous father, even if he has committed only one of the sins which the father has not committed, shall die. And if he has committed even the gross sins named, viz., idolatry, adultery, violent oppression of the poor, robbery, etc., should he then continue to live? The &#1493; in &#1493;&#1495;&#1497; introduces the apodosis, which contains a question, that is simply indicated by the tone, and is immediately denied. The antique form &#1495;&#1497; for &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1492;, 3rd pers. perf., is taken from the Pentateuch (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-22.htm">Genesis 3:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/21-8.htm">Numbers 21:8</a>). The formulae &#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1497;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1514; and &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; &#1489;&#1468;&#1493; dna  are also derived from the language of the law (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-9.htm">Leviticus 20:9</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-11.htm">Leviticus 20:11</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-13.htm">Leviticus 20:13</a>, etc.). </body></html>
