These particulars have reference, first, to religious duties (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm" title="And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,">Ezekiel 18:6</a> a), then to moral obligations, such as the avoidance of adultery (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm" title="And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor's wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,">Ezekiel 18:6</a> b), and finally to duties negative and positive towards one’s neighbour (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/18-7.htm" title="And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;">Ezekiel 18:7-8</a>).

Idolatrous worship was commonly performed upon mountains or high places; and eating part of the sacrifice was properly maintaining communion with the idol to which it was offered. <span class="ital">Neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols — </span>In prayer and adoration. <span class="ital">And hath restored to the debtor his pledge — </span>That is, what he could not be in want of without great inconvenience; such as clothes, bedding, and the like. God forbade the Jews to detain all night any pledge of this kind which they took from a poor man, (see the margin,) which was, in effect, to enjoin them to lend to the poor, without either pawn or usury. <span class="ital">Hath given his bread to the hungry — </span>After the offices of <span class="ital">justice, </span>come those of <span class="ital">charity </span>or <span class="ital">beneficence: </span>see margin. <span class="ital">That hath not given forth upon usury</span> — Usury, when exacted of the poor, has been generally condemned as no better than oppression, and is particularly forbidden by the law: see the margin. It is probable this sort of usury is chiefly here meant, because it is joined with oppression, violence, and want of charity. Every kind and degree of usury, however, was forbidden to the Israelites among one another, to promote a spirit of mutual kindness. But this law was peculiar to them: like their not reaping the corners of their fields, and their not gleaning their vines and olive-trees. <span class="ital">Neither hath taken any increase — </span>This seems to be meant of taking any advantage of the poor upon any occasion: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-36.htm" title="Take you no usury of him, or increase: but fear your God; that your brother may live with you.">Leviticus 25:36</a>. <span class="ital">Hath executed true judgment between man and man — </span>Whenever he has been appointed a judge or an arbiter of differences between men; or, according as he has opportunity of doing it. <span class="ital">Hath walked in my statutes, and kept my judgments — </span>My ordinances and commandments, attending diligently to the various institutions of my worship, and living in continual obedience to my will as revealed in my word, and that from a principle of faith in, and love to me, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/6-5.htm" title="And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.">Deuteronomy 6:5</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/30-20.htm" title="That you may love the LORD your God, and that you may obey his voice, and that you may hold to him: for he is your life, and the length of your days: that you may dwell in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.">Deuteronomy 30:20</a>; <span class="ital">to deal truly — </span>Uprightly and sincerely, according to the best of his knowledge; <span class="ital">he is just — </span>Righteous in a gospel sense.

As to eternity, every man was, is, and will be dealt with, as his conduct shows him to have been under the old covenant of works, or the new covenant of grace. Whatever outward sufferings come upon men through the sins of others, they deserve for their own sins all they suffer; and the Lord overrules every event for the eternal good of believers. All souls are in the hand of the great Creator: he will deal with them in justice or mercy; nor will any perish for the sins of another, who is not in some sense worthy of death for his own. We all have sinned, and our souls must be lost, if God deal with us according to his holy law; but we are invited to come to Christ. If a man who had shown his faith by his works, had a wicked son, whose character and conduct were the reverse of his parent's, could it be expected he should escape the Divine vengeance on account of his father's piety? Surely not. And should a wicked man have a son who walked before God as righteous, this man would not perish for his father's sins. If the son was not free from evils in this life, still he should be partaker of salvation. The question here is not about the meritorious ground of justification, but about the Lord's dealings with the righteous and the wicked.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>All souls are mine - Man is not simply to ascribe his existence to earthly parents, but to acknowledge as his Father Him who created man in His own image, and who gave and gives him the spirit of life.

Here begins the illustration of God's impartiality in a series of supposed cases. The first case is given in Eze 18:5-9, the just man. The excellencies are selected in reference to the prevailing sins of the age, from which such a one stood aloof; hence arises the omission of some features of righteousness, which, under different circumstances, would have been desirable to be enumerated. Each age has its own besetting temptations, and the just man will be distinguished by his guarding against the peculiar defilements, inward and outward, of his age.<p>just &#8230; lawful &#8230; right&#8212;the duties of the second table of the law, which flow from the fear of God.

It ads characteristic of Ezekiel that he starts from the avoidance of sins against the first table of the commandments. <span class="cmt_word">To eat upon the mountains</span> was to take part in the sacrificial feasts on the places, of which he had already spoken (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-16.htm">Ezekiel 16:16</a>; comp. 22:9; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>). The words, <span class="cmt_word">lifted up his eyes,</span> as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-19.htm">Deuteronomy 4:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/121-1.htm">Psalm 121:1</a>, implied every form of idolatrous adoration. The two sins that follow seem to us, as compared with each other, to stand on a very different footing. To Ezekiel, however, they both appeared as <span class="accented">mala prohibita</span>, to each of which the Law assigned the punishment of death (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-19.htm">Leviticus 18:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/20-10.htm">Leviticus 20:10, 18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-22.htm">Deuteronomy 22:22</a>), each involving the dominance of animal passions, in the one case, over the sacred rights of others; in the other, over a law of self-restraint which rested partly on physical grounds, the act condemned frustrating the final cause of the union of the sexes; partly, also, on its ethical significance. The prominence given to it implies that the sin was common, and that it brought with it an infinite degradation of the holiest ties. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/17.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Interpretation of the Riddle<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-11.htm">Ezekiel 17:11</a>.

That it might be a lowly kingdom, not to lift itself up, that he might keep his covenant, that it might stand. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-15.htm">Ezekiel 17:15</a>.

He has broken the covenant, and should he escape? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>. As I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, surely in the place of the king, who made him king, whose oath he despised, and whose covenant he broke with him, in Babel he will die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>.

We have an account of the carrying away of the king, i.e., Jehoiachin, and his princes to Babel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-11.htm">2 Kings 24:11</a>., <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-1.htm">Jeremiah 24:1</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/29-2.htm">Jeremiah 29:2</a>.

The strong of the land (&#1488;&#1497;&#1500;&#1497;  equals  &#1488;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>), whom Nebuchadnezzar took (&#1500;&#1511;&#1495;), i.e., took away to Babel, are not the heads of tribes and families (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>); but the expression is used in a wide sense for the several classes of men of wealth, who are grouped together in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> under the one term &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497; &#1495; (&#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1495;&#1497;&#1500;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), including masons, smiths, and carpenters (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-16.htm">2 Kings 24:16</a>), whereas the heads of tribes and families are classed with the court officials (&#1505;&#1512;&#1497;&#1505;&#1497;&#1501;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-15.htm">2 Kings 24:15</a>) under the title &#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1497;&#1492; (princes) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-12.htm">Ezekiel 17:12</a>. The design of these measures was to make a lowly kingdom, which could not raise itself, i.e., could not revolt, and to deprive the vassal king of the means of breaking of the covenant. the suffix attached to &#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491;&#1492;&#1468; is probably to be taken as referring to &#1502;&#1502;&#1500;&#1499;&#1492; rather than &#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514;&#1497;, although both are admissible, and would yield precisely the same sense, inasmuch as the stability of the kingdom was dependent upon the stability of the covenant. But Zedekiah rebelled (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-20.htm">2 Kings 24:20</a>). The Egyptian king who was to give Zedekiah horses and much people, in other words, to come to his assistance with a powerful army of cavalry and fighting men, was Hophrah, the Apries of the Greeks, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/44-30.htm">Jeremiah 44:30</a> (see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-19.htm">2 Kings 24:19-20</a>). &#1492;&#1497;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; points back to &#1514;&#1468;&#1510;&#1500;&#1495; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-9.htm">Ezekiel 17:9</a>; but here it is applied to the rebellious king, and is explained in the clause '&#1492;&#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1496; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The answer is given in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a> as a word of God confirmed by a solemn oath: he shall die in Babel, the capital of the king, who placed him on the throne, and Pharaoh will not render him any effectual help (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-17.htm">Ezekiel 17:17</a>). &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/15-1.htm">Ezekiel 15:1-8</a> :59, to act with him, that is to say, assist him, come to his help. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1493; refers to Zedekiah, not to Pharaoh, as Ewald assumes in an inexplicable manner. For '&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1498; &#1505;&#1500;&#1500;&#1492; , compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-2.htm">Ezekiel 4:2</a>; and for the fact itself, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-21.htm">Jeremiah 34:21-22</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/37-5.htm">Jeremiah 37:5</a>, according to which, although an Egyptian army came to the rescue of Jerusalem at the time when it was besieged by the Chaldeans, it was repulsed by the Chaldeans who marched to meet it, without having rendered any permanent assistance to the besieged.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, the main thought that breach of faith can bring no deliverance is repeated for the sake of appending the further expansion contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19-21</a>. &#1504;&#1514;&#1503; &#1497;&#1491;&#1493;, he gave his hand, i.e., as a pledge of fidelity. The oath which Zedekiah swore to the king of Babel is designated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a> as Jehovah's oath (&#1488;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;), and the covenant made with him as Jehovah's covenant, because the oath had been sworn by Jehovah, and the covenant of fidelity towards Nebuchadnezzar had thereby been made implicite with Jehovah Himself; so that the breaking of the oath and covenant became a breach of faith towards Jehovah. Consequently the very same expressions are used in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-16.htm">Ezekiel 17:16</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-18.htm">Ezekiel 17:18</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>, to designate this breach of oath, which are applied in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-59.htm">Ezekiel 16:59</a> to the treacherous apostasy of Jerusalem (Israel) from Jehovah, the covenant God. And the same expressions are used to describe the punishment as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-13.htm">Ezekiel 12:13-14</a>. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493; is construed with the accusative of the thing respecting which he was to be judged, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-7.htm">1 Samuel 12:7</a>. Jehovah regards the treacherous revolt from Nebuchadnezzar as treachery against Himself (&#1502;&#1506;&#1500;); not only because Zedekiah had sworn the oath of fidelity by Jehovah, but also from the fact that Jehovah had delivered up His people and kingdom into the power of Nebuchadnezzar, so that revolt from him really became rebellion against God. &#1488;&#1514; before &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493; is nota accus., and is used in the sense of quod adtinet ad, as, for example, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/6-5.htm">2 Kings 6:5</a>. &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, his fugitives, is rendered both by the Chaldee and Syriac "his brave men," or "heroes," and is therefore identified with &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512;&#1493; (his chosen ones), which is the reading in some manuscripts. But neither these renderings nor the parallel passage in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-14.htm">Ezekiel 12:14</a>, where &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; apparently corresponds to it, will warrant our adopting this explanation, or making any alteration in the text. The Greek versions have &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; Theodoret: &#x3b5;&#787;&#x3bd; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3c5;&#x3b3;&#x3b1;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834;; the Vulgate: omnes profugi ejus; and therefore they all had the reading &#1502;&#1489;&#1512;&#1495;&#1493;, which also yields a very suitable meaning. The mention of some who remain, and who are to be scattered toward all the winds, is not at variance with the statement that all the fugitives in the wings of the army are to fall by the sword. The latter threat simply declares that no one will escape death by flight. But there is no necessity to take those who remain as being simply fighting men; and the word "all" must not be taken too literally. </body></html>
