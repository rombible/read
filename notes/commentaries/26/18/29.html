The true penitent is a true believer. None of his former transgressions shall be mentioned unto him, but in the righteousness which he has done, as the fruit of faith and the effect of conversion, he shall surely live. The question is not whether the truly righteous ever become apostates. It is certain that many who for a time were thought to be righteous, do so, while ver. 26,27 speaks the fulness of pardoning mercy: when sin is forgiven, it is blotted out, it is remembered no more. In their righteousness they shall live; not for their righteousness, as if that were an atonement for their sins, but in their righteousness, which is one of the blessings purchased by the Mediator. What encouragement a repenting, returning sinner has to hope for pardon and life according to this promise! In verse 28 is the beginning and progress of repentance. True believers watch and pray, and continue to the end, and they are saved. In all our disputes with God, he is in the right, and we are in the wrong.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/18.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Equal - literally, "weighed out, balanced."

Though the case was put so many ways, and the thing was made so clear and plain, by the instances given; as, if a man was a just man, let his father be what he would, he should live; but, if his son was a wicked man, he should die; yet, if his son should do well, he should not die for his father's sins, his father only should suffer for his iniquity; and then again, on the one hand, if a seemingly righteous man become an apostate, he should be treated as such; but, on the other hand, if a wicked man repented and reformed, things would go well with him; by all which it most clearly appeared that God did not, and would not, punish children for the sins of their fathers, unless they themselves were guilty of the same; and that the methods of Providence in dealing with men in this world, as they were good or bad, were equal and right, and to be justified: <p>O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal?

And behold, he begetteth a son, who seeth all his father's sins which he doeth; he seeth them, and doeth not such things. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>. He eateth not upon the mountains, and lifteth not up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he defileth not his neighbour's wife, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-16.htm">Ezekiel 18:16</a>. And oppresseth no one; he doth not withhold a pledge, and committeth not robbery; giveth his bread to the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a>. He holdeth back his hand from the distressed one, taketh not usury and interest, doeth my rights, walketh in my statutes; he will not die for the sin of his father; he shall live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-18.htm">Ezekiel 18:18</a>. His father, because he hath practised oppression, committed robbery upon his brother, and hath done that which is not good in the midst of his people; behold, he shall die for his sin. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Ezekiel 18:19</a>. And do ye say, Why doth the son not help to bear the father's sin? But the son hath done right and righteousness, hath kept all my statutes, and done them; he shall live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. A son shall not help to bear the father's sin, and a father shall not help to bear the sin of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. - The case supposed in these verses forms the antithesis to the preceding one; the father is the transgressor in this instance, and the son a keeper of the law. The subject to &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not the righteous man described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>, but a man who is described immediately afterwards as a transgressor of the commandments of God. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; bite in the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, et timuerit, as it has been by the translators of the Septuagint and Vulgate; nor is it to be altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as it has been by the Masoretes, to make it accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>; but it is the apocopated form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, as in the preceding clause, and the object is to be repeated from what precedes, as in the similar case which we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, (18). Ewald and Hitzig propose to alter &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a> into &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, but without the slightest necessity. The lxx are not to be taken as an authority for this, since the Chaldee and Syriac have both read and rendered &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and Ezekiel, when repeating the same sentences, is accustomed to make variations in particular words. Holding back the hand from the distressed, is equivalent to abstaining from seizing upon him for the purpose of crushing him (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-12.htm">Ezekiel 18:12</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498;, in the midst of his countrymen  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, is adopted from the language of the Pentateuch. &#1502;&#1514; after &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a participle. The question, "Why does the son not help to bear?" is not a direct objection on the part of the people, but is to be taken as a pretext, which the people might offer on the ground of the law, that God would visit the sin of the fathers upon the sons in justification of their proverb. Ezekiel cites this pretext for the purpose of meeting it by stating the reason why this does not occur. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;, to carry, near or with, to join in carrying, or help to carry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>). This proved the proverb to be false, and confirmed the assertion made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, to which the address therefore returns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The righteousness of the righteous man will come upon him, i.e., upon the righteous man, namely, in its consequences. The righteous man will receive the blessing of righteousness, but the unrighteous man the curse of his wickedness. There is no necessity for the article, which the Keri proposes to insert before &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. </body></html>
