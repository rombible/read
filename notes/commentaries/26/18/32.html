On this is grounded an exhortation to repent, and to make them a new heart and a new spirit.

The sense is, that he takes no pleasure in the afflictions, calamities, and captivity of men, which are meant by death here; but rather that they would repent and reform, and live in their own land, and enjoy the good things of it; which shows the mercy and compassion of God to sinners: <p>wherefore, he renews his exhortation, <p>turn yourselves, and live ye; or, "ye shall live" (r); I take no delight in your present deaths, your captivity; it would be more agreeable to me would you turn from your evil ways to the Lord your God, and behave according to the laws I have given you to walk by, and so live in your own land, in the quiet possession of your goods and estates. <p>(r) "et vivetis", Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/18.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the Lord GOD: wherefore turn yourselves, and live ye.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/18.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">32</span>. The appeal to turn from evil sustained by reference to the prevailing nature of God. He is the God of salvation; his will is that men should live. The A.V. marg. to “turn yourselves (cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm" title="Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, said the Lord GOD. Repent, and turn yourselves from all your transgressions; so iniquity shall not be your ruin.">Ezekiel 18:30</a></span>) <span class="ital">or others</span>” is altogether false. The active form “turn” is either used intransitively, or yourselves (lit. your faces) is understood, cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm" title="Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Repent, and turn yourselves from your idols; and turn away your faces from all your abominations.">Ezekiel 14:6</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(1) The place of the present chapter may be explained by connecting it with the Messianic prophecy immediately preceding (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-22.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; I will also take of the highest branch of the high cedar, and will set it; I will crop off from the top of his young twigs a tender one, and will plant it on an high mountain and eminent:...">Ezekiel 17:22-24</a>); the passage enunciates the principles and conditions of entering the perfect kingdom. The same principles are stated in two other passages, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/3-16.htm" title="And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 3:16-21</a>, and ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-1.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,...">Ezekiel 33:1-20</a>. They are properly in place in the last passage. The prophet feels himself, however, essentially a prophet of the new age, and writing his Book after the fall of Jerusalem he may have expanded principles less fully developed at an earlier time. The age before which he stands is an ideal one, and principles realized but imperfectly now shall then have full prevalence (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-16.htm" title="But I will leave a few men of them from the sword, from the famine, and from the pestilence; that they may declare all their abominations among the heathen where they come; and they shall know that I am the LORD.">Ezekiel 12:16</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-22.htm" title="Yet, behold, therein shall be left a remnant that shall be brought forth, both sons and daughters: behold, they shall come forth to you, and you shall see their way and their doings: and you shall be comforted concerning the evil that I have brought on Jerusalem, even concerning all that I have brought on it.">Ezekiel 14:22</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(2) The principle which the prophet insists upon is not the strict retributive righteousness of God, but the moral freedom and independence of the individual person. The individual is not involved in the destiny of his fathers or of his people; neither does he lie under an irrevocable doom pronounced over him by his past life. The immediate relation of every spirit to God and its moral freedom to break with its own past raises it above both these dooms. What Ezekiel teaches regarding God is that he hath no pleasure that the wicked should die. The prophet’s whole purpose is practical, to strike off from the people the shackles of a despair that was settling upon them, whether they looked to themselves or to God. What he says of men is that each stands in immediate relation to God and shall live or die according as he repents or continues in his sin; and what he teaches of God is that in spite of the dark clouds of judgment behind which he seems now hidden his prevailing will is that men should live.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>(3) The conception of the prophet is a complex or double one, having an internal and an external side. The inward element in the conception is the spiritual relation of the individual person to God; the outward element is the form “life” and “death” in which this internal relation is made manifest, rewarded or punished in God’s treatment of the individual person. We perceive a cleavage taking place between these two elements. The principles enunciated by the prophet refer to the spiritual relation of the individual to God, and are true when limited to this. The individual shall not, in this sense, suffer for the sins of his people, nor the child for the sins of his father; and even his own past life does not weave an inexorable fate around him from which there is no escape. In all cases consequences evil enough may descend upon the son from the father, or upon himself from his own past life, but not this particular consequence. His moral freedom and independence raises him above these consequences, and brings him as an independent person into direct relation with God, over against others and even over against his former self. And this is really all that the prophet is teaching of new truth here. It is truth which the New Testament teaches, and which is the foundation of all morals. To charge the prophet with cutting up the individual human life into sections which have no moral relation to one another, or with teaching that a man shall live or die according to the condition in which he shall be found “for the moment” when the judgment overtakes him, is grossly to distort his language.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>It may be true that the prophet has not yet been able fully to analyse his own complex conception and separate completely the spiritual relation of the mind to God from the person’s external conditions. No Old Testament writer probably has been able to do this consciously and formally, although it is often done in principle and in moments of spiritual elevation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/73-23.htm" title="Nevertheless I am continually with you: you have held me by my right hand.">Psalm 73:23</a> <span class="ital">seq.</span>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/17-14.htm" title="That the kingdom might be base, that it might not lift itself up, but that by keeping of his covenant it might stand....">Ezekiel 17:14-15</a>). But the ideal character of the age which the prophet feels to be about to dawn, and to which he applies his principles, marks an approach towards completing the distinction. This future though imminent ideal time, the time of the perfect kingdom of God, is that which corresponds to our idea of heaven, or another future world, in which external condition will perfectly correspond to spiritual state. The prophet’s ideal world, in which spiritual relation would be perfectly bodied out externally, was still the earth. “Life” and “death,” in the ordinary sense of these words, were the only means by which inward spiritual relations could find proper outward expression.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/18.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 32.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Turn yourselves,</span> etc. As in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>, but there is no ground for the rendering of "turn others," suggested in the margin of the Authorized Version. So we close what we may rightly speak of as among the noblest of Ezekiel's utterances, that which makes him take his place side by side with the greatest of the prophets as a preacher of repentance and forgiveness. In the next chapter he returns to his parables of history after the fashion of those of ch. 17. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/18.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The son who avoids his father's sin will live; but the father will die for his own sins. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a>. And behold, he begetteth a son, who seeth all his father's sins which he doeth; he seeth them, and doeth not such things. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>. He eateth not upon the mountains, and lifteth not up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel; he defileth not his neighbour's wife, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-16.htm">Ezekiel 18:16</a>. And oppresseth no one; he doth not withhold a pledge, and committeth not robbery; giveth his bread to the hungry, and covereth the naked with clothes. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a>. He holdeth back his hand from the distressed one, taketh not usury and interest, doeth my rights, walketh in my statutes; he will not die for the sin of his father; he shall live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-18.htm">Ezekiel 18:18</a>. His father, because he hath practised oppression, committed robbery upon his brother, and hath done that which is not good in the midst of his people; behold, he shall die for his sin. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-19.htm">Ezekiel 18:19</a>. And do ye say, Why doth the son not help to bear the father's sin? But the son hath done right and righteousness, hath kept all my statutes, and done them; he shall live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>. The soul that sinneth, it shall die. A son shall not help to bear the father's sin, and a father shall not help to bear the sin of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. - The case supposed in these verses forms the antithesis to the preceding one; the father is the transgressor in this instance, and the son a keeper of the law. The subject to &#1492;&#1493;&#1500;&#1497;&#1491; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not the righteous man described in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-15.htm">Ezekiel 18:15</a>, but a man who is described immediately afterwards as a transgressor of the commandments of God. The Chetib &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1488; bite in the last clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-14.htm">Ezekiel 18:14</a> is not to be read &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3c6;&#x3bf;&#x3b2;&#x3b7;&#x3b8;&#x3b7;&#834;&#837;, et timuerit, as it has been by the translators of the Septuagint and Vulgate; nor is it to be altered into &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;&#1492;, as it has been by the Masoretes, to make it accord with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>; but it is the apocopated form &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1512;&#1488;, as in the preceding clause, and the object is to be repeated from what precedes, as in the similar case which we find in <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/20-15.htm">Exodus 20:15</a>, (18). Ewald and Hitzig propose to alter &#1502;&#1506;&#1504;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-17.htm">Ezekiel 18:17</a> into &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; after <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, but without the slightest necessity. The lxx are not to be taken as an authority for this, since the Chaldee and Syriac have both read and rendered &#1506;&#1504;&#1497;; and Ezekiel, when repeating the same sentences, is accustomed to make variations in particular words. Holding back the hand from the distressed, is equivalent to abstaining from seizing upon him for the purpose of crushing him (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-12.htm">Ezekiel 18:12</a>); &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498;, in the midst of his countrymen  equals  &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493;&#1498; &#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;, is adopted from the language of the Pentateuch. &#1502;&#1514; after &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is a participle. The question, "Why does the son not help to bear?" is not a direct objection on the part of the people, but is to be taken as a pretext, which the people might offer on the ground of the law, that God would visit the sin of the fathers upon the sons in justification of their proverb. Ezekiel cites this pretext for the purpose of meeting it by stating the reason why this does not occur. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; &#1489;, to carry, near or with, to join in carrying, or help to carry (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-17.htm">Numbers 11:17</a>). This proved the proverb to be false, and confirmed the assertion made in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-4.htm">Ezekiel 18:4</a>, to which the address therefore returns (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20</a>). The righteousness of the righteous man will come upon him, i.e., upon the righteous man, namely, in its consequences. The righteous man will receive the blessing of righteousness, but the unrighteous man the curse of his wickedness. There is no necessity for the article, which the Keri proposes to insert before &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;. </body></html>
