The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare 1Ki 8:14, 22, Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also 2Ki 11:14; 23:3, "by a pillar": the customary place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than formerly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The burnt-offering; </span> this is different from that <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/42-13.htm" title="Then said he to me, The north chambers and the south chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy chambers, where the priests that approach to the LORD shall eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the trespass offering; for the place is holy.">Ezekiel 42:13</a></span>, as appears both from the kind of sacrifice and the occasion of it, or the time of each. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In the sabbath day; </span> or weekly, sabbath by sabbath; this was three times as much as was required, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm" title="And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:">Numbers 28:9</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Six lambs</span> of the first year, and males, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-13.htm" title="You shall daily prepare a burnt offering to the LORD of a lamb of the first year without blemish: you shall prepare it every morning.">Ezekiel 46:13</a></span>, and as the Hebrew implies. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without blemish; </span> unblemished sacrifices were ever required, and so this, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-3.htm" title="If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD.">Leviticus 1:3</a> <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/6-14.htm" title="And he shall offer his offering to the LORD, one he lamb of the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering, and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,">Numbers 6:14</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A ram; </span> when it was more than a year old, the Jews accounted it a ram. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the burnt offering the prince shall offer unto the Lord in the sabbath day,.... In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-17.htm">Ezekiel 45:17</a>, it is said to be the prince's part to give and prepare sacrifices in the feasts, new moons, sabbaths, and all solemnities; and there follows an account of them, for New Year's Day, and for the feasts of passover and tabernacles; and here an account is given of those for the sabbaths and new moons; which is very properly reserved for this place, to follow the account of the opening of the eastern gate at those seasons: and the burnt offering for the sabbath shall be <p>six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish; according to the law of Moses, only two lambs were the burnt offering for this day, besides the continual one, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-9.htm">Numbers 28:9</a>, here Jarchi confesses his ignorance; and Kimchi says it is a new thing; and indeed it is, and is a proof of the ceremonial law being now abolished. These seven denote the perfect sacrifice of Christ, by which he has perfected for ever them that are sanctified; and being without blemish, the purity and holiness of it; and as the people of God on the six working days commit much sin, and contract much guilt, the sacrifice of Christ is signified by six lambs, which it is necessary they should hear of, and it should be set before them in the ministry of the word on Lord's days, which is meant by the offering of it; that they may by faith apply it to themselves, to the removal of sin from their consciences, and take the comfort of it; as the one ram may denote the one sacrifice of Christ, though typified by many; and who, like the ram, is the leader and guide of the flock: now, more creatures being offered for this burnt offering than under the law, denotes the clearer knowledge of the sacrifice of Christ under the Gospel, and the more extensive efficacy of it, to the removal of the guilt of sin from the Lord's people. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4–6</span>.
