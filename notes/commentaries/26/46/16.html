According to <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/45-7.htm" title="And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length shall be over against one of the portions, from the west border to the east border.">Ezekiel 45:7-8</a>, he was to have a portion of land on each side of the “oblation,” which should be sufficiently ample to prevent any attempts on his part at violence and exaction. For the same purpose, it was necessary that this territory should remain inalienably in his family. He might therefore convey any portion of it to his sons in fee simple, for they would naturally inherit it; but a conveyance to any one else came under the Mosaic law (Leviticus 25), and reverted to him or his heirs in the year of Jubile, here called “the year of liberty.”<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/46.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/46-16.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift to any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance....">Ezekiel 46:16-18</a></span>. <span class="ital">If the prince give a gift, </span>&c. — By these verses we learn, that even gifts, or legacies of lands, could only be granted till the year of jubilee, except to a person’s own heirs; for at that period all such gifts or grants devolved again to the original possessors, or their heirs. <span class="ital">It shall be his to the year of liberty — </span>That is, <span class="ital">of jubilee, </span>called the year of <span class="ital">liberty, </span>because it freed men’s persons from the service of their masters, and their estates from any engagements by which the right of them was transferred from their proper owners. <span class="ital">After it shall return to the prince — </span>Or to his heirs, if he be dead. <span class="ital">But his inheritance shall be his sons’ for them — </span>Or, his inheritance shall belong to his sons; it shall be theirs so as not to be alienated. <span class="ital">The prince shall not take of the people’s inheritance — </span>As Ahab did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-16.htm" title="And it came to pass, when Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, that Ahab rose up to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.">1 Kings 21:16</a>. <span class="ital">That my people be not scattered </span>— Lest, being turned out of their own, they be forced to wander up and down the country for a livelihood.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>46:1-24 The ordinances of worship for the prince and for the people, are here described, and the gifts the prince may bestow on his sons and servants. Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The prince was robe provided with possessions of his own, in order to prevent exactions from his subjects; further enactments are added to prevent the alienation of the prince's land. Any gifts made to his servants must revert to the prince in the "year of liberty," or jubilee (see the marginal reference note). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16-18. The prince's possession is to be inalienable, and any portion given to a servant is to revert to his sons at the year of jubilee, that he may have no temptation to spoil his people of their inheritance, as formerly (compare Ahab and Naboth, 1Ki 21:1-29). The mention of the year of jubilee implies that there is something literal meant, besides the spiritual sense. The jubilee year was restored after the captivity [Josephus, Antiquities, 14.10,6; 1 Maccabees 6:49]. Perhaps it will be restored under Messiah's coming reign. Compare Isa 61:2, 3, where "the acceptable year of the Lord" is closely connected with the comforting of the mourners in Zion, and "the day of vengeance" on Zion's foes. The mention of the prince's sons is another argument against Messiah being meant by "the prince."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">A gift, </span> of houses or lands. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The inheritance thereof, </span> the right to those houses or lands, shall descend to children’s children; the fee simple shall be to the posterity of that son to whom it was first given.

Having finished the account of the sacrifices of the prince and people, the monthly, weekly, and daily ones; here his gifts are treated of, which are two fold; some given to his sons, others to his servants: <p>if the prince give a gift to any of his sons; Christ, the Prince, has sons; he that is the Prince, of peace is the everlasting Father; he has children given unto him, whom he preserves; a seed promised him in covenant, which shall always endure; a family he is master of, and cares for; for whose sake he became incarnate, suffered, and died: they are sons by adopting grace, and in their adoption he has a great concern; they are predestinated to it by him; they receive it through him; he gives them power to become the sons of God, and they are manifestatively so through faith in him; they appear to be his sons, or are evidenced as such by their regeneration, which also is of him: it is by his Spirit they are regenerated; it is his grace that is implanted in them; it is he himself that is formed in them, and his image that is stamped upon them; it is owing to his word and Gospel as the means and to his resurrection as the virtual cause of it; it is in his church they are born, yea, of her, to whom he stands in the relation of a husband, and so they are sons brought forth to him by her; and these are princes by birth, have a free and princely spirit, and are brought up and provided for as such: now to these Christ gives gifts; gifts of special grace, all sorts of grace; sanctifying grace, faith, hope, love, repentance, &amp;c.; justifying grace, the gift of righteousness; pardoning grace; adopting grace; all supplies of grace; spiritual strength, peace, joy and comfort; and persevering grace, to hold out to the end: and he also gives glory or eternal life; this is with him, in his hands; he has a power to give and he does give it, to all his sons; all which, being once given, ever continue. <p>The inheritance thereof shall be his sons', it shall be their possession by inheritance; that is, it shall ever remain with them, shall never be taken away from them; these are gifts and calling without repentance, irreversible blessings, which are for ever: sanctifying grace is a well of living water, springing up unto eternal life; faith, hope, and love, always abide; Christ's justifying righteousness is an everlasting one; pardon of sin is of all sin, past, present, and to come, and is never made void or called in; once children of God, and always such; and the inheritance of heaven is incorruptible, never fading, and eternal; and all this flows from the unchangeable love of God and Christ to these sons of the prince. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall be their possession by inheritance.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/46.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16–18</span>.
