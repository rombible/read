Our Lord has directed us to do many duties, but he has also left many things to our choice, that those who delight in his commandments may abound therein to his glory, without entangling their own consciences, or prescribing rules unfit for others; but we must never omit our daily worship, nor neglect to apply the sacrifice of the Lamb of God to our souls, for pardon, peace, and salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/46.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Compare with <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28.htm">Numbers 28</a>. The enumeration of the offerings both for the Sabbath and new moon is here less complete than there; e. g., the drink offerings are passed by, and in the case of the new moon festival no mention is made of the blowing of trumpets (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/10-10.htm">Numbers 10:10</a>). <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare 1Ki 8:14, 22, Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also 2Ki 11:14; 23:3, "by a pillar": the customary place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than formerly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> In these verses nothing new occurs but the appointing a bullock with its meat-offering for the new moon sacrifice, of which also on another occasion already, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-1.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that looks toward the east shall be shut the six working days; but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the new moon it shall be opened.">Ezekiel 46:1</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A young bullock:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-22.htm" title="And on that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.">Ezekiel 45:22</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Without blemish:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-4.htm" title="The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister to the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and an holy place for the sanctuary.">Ezekiel 45:4</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Six lambs:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-4.htm" title="And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer to the LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish, and a ram without blemish.">Ezekiel 46:4</a></span>. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/46.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish,.... This is also different from the law of Moses, which required two young bullocks and a ram, and seven lambs, <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11</a>, whereas here only one bullock: <p>and six lambs, and a ram; they shall be without blemish; and here Kimchi acknowledges again that this is a new thing to be done in future time. Some have observed, that the seven lambs under the law showed that perfection might be hoped for and expected; but, there being but six now, that this is not yet attained, nor will be till the saints get to heaven; though perfection is come by the priesthood of Christ, whose sacrifice is a perfect and complete one, and by which his people are perfected, and they are complete in him, yet they have no perfection in themselves. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/46.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be without blemish.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verses 6, 7</span> specify the corresponding sacrifices for the new moons. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> A burnt offering of a <span class="cmt_word">young bullock without blemish</span>, six lambs, and a ram, with which may be compared the two bullocks, one ram, and seven lambs of the Mosaic Torah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/28-11.htm">Numbers 28:11-15</a>). <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> A meat (or, meal) offering of <span class="cmt_word">an ephah</span> for the bullock, <span class="cmt_word">an ephah</span> for the ram, and for the lambs <span class="cmt_word">according as his hand shall attain unto</span> (comp. ver 5; and the similar expressions in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-7.htm">Leviticus 5:7, 11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/12-8.htm">Leviticus 12:8</a>), with a <span class="cmt_word">hin of oil</span> to an ephah.

The Torah of Ezekiel omits the sin offering of a he-goat, which had a place in the Torah of Moses. </body></html>
