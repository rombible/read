Of the later kings some forsook Yahweh for false gods, some encroached upon the prerogative of the priest. Now all should be set right. The prince occupies a position analogous to that of Solomon <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/6-12.htm">2 Chronicles 6:12-13</a>, standing in front of the porch of the eastern gate of the inner court, and at the head of his people to lead their worship, while the priests are sacrificing before him. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/46.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>2. The prince is to go through the east gate without (open on the Sabbath only, to mark its peculiar sanctity) to the entrance of the gate of the inner court; he is to go no further, but "stand by the post" (compare 1Ki 8:14, 22, Solomon standing before the altar of the Lord in the presence of the congregation; also 2Ki 11:14; 23:3, "by a pillar": the customary place), the court within belonging exclusively to the priests. There, as representative of the people, in a peculiarly near relation to God, he is to present his offerings to Jehovah, while at a greater distance, the people are to stand worshipping at the outer gate of the same entrance. The offerings on Sabbaths are larger than those of the Mosaic law, to imply that the worship of God is to be conducted by the prince and people in a more munificent spirit of self-sacrificing liberality than formerly.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/46.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The prince</span> must come in at the gate which is between the court of the Jews and the court of the priests, which is here called the <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">gate without, </span> or the <span class="ital">outer gate</span> of that court, and so go up to the gate within, which leads into the inmost court, and rose by ten, or twelve, or fifteen stairs, say some.

That is, by the way of the porch of the eastern gate, even the outermost gate of the porch; for, as every gate had a porch, so every porch had two gates, one at one end, and the other at the other; now this was the outermost gate of the porch, which looked to the outward court, and not that which led into the inner: <p>and shall stand by the post of the gate; this denotes the presence of Christ, the Prince with his people waiting at Wisdom's gate, and watching at the posts of her door. The allusion seems to be to the king's pillar in the temple, where he used to stand, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/23-13.htm">2 Chronicles 23:13</a>. Some understand this of Christ's incarnation, of his entrance into the world, and his standing before his Father, and praying for his people, as he did in the garden, and a little before his death, as recorded <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/17-1.htm">John 17:1</a>. <p>and the priests shall prepare his burnt offerings, and his peace offerings; that is, shall offer them.

If porch, then the porch of the inner gate is meant, which lay “without,” i.e. towards the outer court (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-31.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:31</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-34.htm" title="And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:34</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-37.htm" title="And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm trees were on the posts thereof, on this side, and on that side: and the going up to it had eight steps.">Ezekiel 40:37</a>). If “without” refers to gate, then the porch of the outer gate is meant. In the latter case the prince would cross the outer court from the porch of the outer gate and enter the inner gate, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-3.htm" title="It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.">Ezekiel 44:3</a>. Neither is it certain whether the “posts” and “threshold” are those at the outer end of the inner gate, or those at the end opening into the inner court. The technical “threshold” lay at the inner end, inasmuch as the inner gate was the outer gate reversed (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-6.htm" title="Then came he to the gate which looks toward the east, and went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.">Ezekiel 40:6</a>). It is possible that the prince was allowed to enter the inner gateway and advance to the inner end of it so as to have a full view of the operations of the priests at the altar, without, however, being permitted to set his foot in the inner court. In this case “porch” would be that of the inner gate (as A.V.).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/46.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 2.</span> - The reason for the opening of this inner east gate should be that the prince might enter it as far as its threshold, and stand there worshipping by the posts of the gate, while his burnt offerings and his peace offerings were being prepared by the priests, who, rather than the prince, were the proper ministers for conducting the sacrificial ceremony. The prince should reach his station at the threshold of the inner gate, <span class="cmt_word">by the way of the porch of that</span> (or, the) <span class="cmt_word">gate without</span>; but whether this signified that he should pass through the eastern gate of the outer court, and so advance towards the inner east gate, as Ewald, Keil, Kliefoth, and Plumptre assume, or, as Hengstenberg, Schroder, and Smend suppose, that he should enter the inner gate by the way of the porch of the gate, <span class="accented">i.e.</span> from the outside, from the outer court into which he had previously entered through either the north or the south outer gates, cannot be decided. In favor of the former may be urged the consideration that it seems more natural to apply <span class="hebrew">&#x5de;&#x5b4;&#x5d4;&#x5d5;&#x5bc;&#x5e6;</span> to the outer gate than to the outer court, since no, one could enter the inner gate except from the outer court, unless he were already in the inner court; but in favor of the latter is <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> the stringent character of the language in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1-3</a>, which expressly declares that the outer east gate should not be opened, and that no man <span class="accented">should enter in by it</span>, thus scarcely admitting of an exception; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> the statement in vers. 9, 10 of the present chapter, that in the "appointed feasts" the prince and the people alike should enter the outer court either by the north or the south gate, since, if any of these "feasts" fell upon a sabbath, this regulation would not be practicable, if the prince and the people were required to enter by different doors. The question, however, in itself is immaterial. The points of importance are that the prince should worship in the porch of the inner gate, and that, on finishing his worship, he should retire, and that the gate should not be shut; until the evening. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/41.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Altar of Burnt-Offering in the holy place (see Plate III n). "The abrupt style of writing is still continued." The altar wood for the altar was of wood three cubits high; its length, i.e., the expanse of the wall from one corner to the other, was two cubits; the breadth (thickness), which is not expressly mentioned, was the same, because the square form is presupposed from the shape of this altar in the tabernacle and Solomon's temple. Under the term &#1502;&#1511;&#1510;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493;, its corner-pieces, the horns projecting at the corners, or the horn-shaped points, are probably included, as the simple mention of the corners appears superfluous, and the horns, which were symbolically significant features in the altar, would certainly not have been wanting. There is something strange in the occurrence of &#1493;&#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; before and along with &#1511;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, as the length is already included in the walls, and it would not be appropriately said of the length that it was of wood. &#1488;&#1512;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is therefore certainly a copyist's error for &#1488;&#1491;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#x3b7;&#788; &#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3b9;&#x3c2; &#x3b1;&#x3c5;&#787;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#834; (lxx), its stand or pedestal. The angel describes this altar as the "table which stands before Jehovah" - in perfect harmony with the epithet already applied to the sacrifices in the Pentateuch, the "bread (&#1500;&#1495;&#1501;) of God," though not "because the altar table was intended to combine the old table of shewbread and the altar of incense" (Bttcher). The table of shewbread is not mentioned any more than the candlestick and other portions of the temple furniture. - The altar of burnt-offering stood before Jehovah, i.e., before the entrance into the holy of holies. This leads in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a>. to the notice of the doors of the sanctuary, the character of which is also described as simply openings (&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495;), since the doorway had been mentioned before. delet &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; signifies a moveable door, and the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;, doors, whether they consist of one leaf or two, i.e., whether they are single or folding doors. Here the &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-23.htm">Ezekiel 41:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> (&#1500;&#1491;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514;) are folding doors; on the other hand, the first &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-24.htm">Ezekiel 41:24</a> and &#1491;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514; ibid. are used for the wings of the door, and &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; for the swinging portions (leaves) of the separate wings. The meaning is this: the holy place (&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500;) and the holy of holies (&#1492;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;) had two folding doors (i.e., each of these rooms had one). These doors had two wings, and each of these wings, in the one door and in the other, had two reversible door-leaves, so that when going in and out there was no necessity to throw open on every occasion the whole of the wing, which was at least three or four cubits broad. There is no foundation for the objection raised by Kliefoth to the interpretation of &#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; &#1493;&#1500;&#1511;&#1468;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; as signifying the holy place and the holy of holies; since he cannot deny that the two words are so used, &#1492;&#1497;&#1499;&#1500; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-5.htm">1 Kings 6:5</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-17.htm">1 Kings 6:17</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-33.htm">1 Kings 6:33</a>, and &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/16-2.htm">Leviticus 16:2-3</a>, etc. And the artificial explanation, "to the temple space, and indeed to the holy place," not only passes without notice the agreement between our verses and <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/6-31.htm">1 Kings 6:31-34</a>, but gains nothing further than a side door, which does violence to the dignity of the sanctuary, a passage from the side chambers into the holy place, with which Bttcher has presented Solomon's temple. - These doors were ornamented, like the walls, with figures of cherubim and palms. - Other remarks are added in vv. 25b and 26 concerning the porch in front of the holy place. The first is, that on the front of the porch outside there was &#1506;&#1489; &#1488;&#1509;. The only other passage in which the word &#1506;&#1489; occurs in a similar connection is <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/7-6.htm">1 Kings 7:6</a>, where it refers to wood-work in front of the Ulam of Solomon's porch of pillars; and it cannot be determined whether it signifies threshold, or moulding, or threshold-mouldings. On the shoulders, i.e., on the right and left side walls of the front porch, there were closed windows and figures of palms. The cherubim were omitted here. - The last words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-26.htm">Ezekiel 41:26</a> are very obscure. &#1493;&#1510;&#1500;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1489;&#1468; may be taken in connection with the preceding clause, "and on the side-rooms of the temple," as there is no necessity to repeat the preposition in the case of closely continuous clauses (vid., Ewald, 351a); and the side-rooms not only must have had windows, but might also be ornamented with figures of palms. But if the words be taken in this sense, the &#1506;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; must also signify something which presented, like the walls of the porch and of the side chambers, a considerable extent of surface capable of receiving a similar decoration; although nothing definite has hitherto been ascertained with regard to the meaning of the word, and our rendering "beams" makes no pretension to correctness. </body></html>
