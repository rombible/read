"Gog" is here the name of a captain from "the land of Magog" (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-2.htm">Genesis 10:2</a>) the name of a people of the north, placed between "Gomer" (the Cimmerians) and "Madai" (the Medes). In the History of Assurbanipal from cuneiform inscriptions, a chief of the Saka (Scythians), called Ga-a-gi, is identified by some with Gog. Rosh, if a proper name, occurs in this connection only. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>3.

Which is repeated for the confirmation of it, that so it would certainly be; that the Lord, the mighty God, and King of kings, would in his providence frown upon him, and appear against him; and his titles are repeated also, to show that all his greatness, grandeur, and power, would not protect him from the vengeance of God. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">3</span>. <span class="ital">chief prince</span>] Cf. on <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,">Ezekiel 38:2</a></span>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 3.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I am against thee, O Gog</span>. Just because Gog was against Israel, Jehovah was against Gog. Gog's invasion of Israel's land would be a declaration of war against Israel's God. so that the conflict would rather be between Jehovah and Gog than between Israel and Gog. Hence throughout this prophecy Jehovah is represented as the principal actor on the side of Israel, who seeks her defense not in walls and bulwarks or in earthly alliances and military combinations, s in the days of the monarchy before the exile, but in the presence of Jehovah in her midst. </body></html>
