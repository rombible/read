It is supposed these enemies will come together to invade the land of Judea, and God will defeat them. God not only sees who are now the enemies of his church, but he foresees who will be so, and lets them know by his word that he is against them; though they join together, the wicked shall not be unpunished.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/38.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>As Gog was drawn on to his attack upon Israel in order to his ultimate ruin, therefore his preparations were the first step in his visitation from the Almighty.<p>After many days - For "many days." Many a long day shall the hand of God be upon thee, drawing thee on to thy ruin, and in the latter days shalt thou come.<p>The land - literally, a "land" once laid waste by the sword, but now delivered from it, whose inhabitants once scattered have been gathered together from out of many peoples.<p>Always - Rather, a long time. The mountains were at the time of Gog's advance again cultivated and populous.<p>And they shall dwell - Rather, and they dwell. It is a description of the actual condition at the time of Gog's invasion (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/18-7.htm">Judges 18:7</a>). Such was the condition of the restored Jews in their prosperous days, after which came invasion. Such shall be the condition of the Church previous to the final conflict between good and evil. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/38.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. cloud to cover the land&#8212;with the multitude of thy forces.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Thou shalt:</span> sometimes such phrase declares duty and is perceptive, but here it declares the event and is predictive, Gog will, though he should not.

Taken together, the images suggest that Gog's invasion should burst forth suddenly, rage violently, spread quickly, alarm greatly, but cease finally. Storms roar and crash, alarm and destroy, but do not continue. Clouds diffuse gloom and fear, but ultimately disperse. </body></html>
