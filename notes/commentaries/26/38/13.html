These are not any of the people that shall come along with Gog on his expedition; but some neighbouring nations bordering on Judea, who will address him in the following manner, as he passes through them, or by them. Sheba and Dedan design the Arabians inhabiting that part of Arabia which lay near to Judea, even Arabia Petraea and Felix; and the merchants of Tarshish are the Tyrians and Zidonians that traded by sea, as Tarshish sometimes signifies; or to Tartessus in Spain, where they had much traffic; and may design the people of those places that will at this time be living in Palestine, that trade by sea to foreign parts. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it the "Carthaginian merchants", or "the merchants of Carthage": <p>with all the young lions thereof; which some interpret of sea pirates, for their cruelty and voraciousness. The Targum paraphrases it, all the kings thereof; and so Kimchi thinks kings and princes are meant; but the Septuagint version renders it, all their villages; and so the Syriac version, all the cities: <p>shall say unto thee, art thou come to take a spoil? either out of compassion to the people of the Jews; or rather by way of congratulation, and as expressive of joy at it; or else out of envy that they have no share in it; suggesting that they would gladly join with him, and partake of the booty: <p>hast thou gathered thy company together to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil? all which it is supposed might easily be done; only they might wonder that so rich a potentate as the Turk should give himself the trouble to raise such an army, and come so far, for cattle and goods, and silver and gold of which he had such plenty. Gog gives no answer, but God does. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all its young lions, shall say to thee, <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> Art thou come to take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey? to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods, to take a great spoil?</span><p>(h) One enemy will envy another because everyone will think to have the spoil of the Church.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">13</span>. The merchant peoples are roused to excitement by the enterprise of Gog; probably it is the hope of gain by trafficking with him for his spoil that excites them—hardly envy at the rich harvest lying before him. On Sheba <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a>; Dedan <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-20.htm" title="Dedan was your merchant in precious clothes for chariots.">Ezekiel 27:20</a>; Tarshish <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm" title="Tarshish was your merchant by reason of the multitude of all kind of riches; with silver, iron, tin, and lead, they traded in your fairs.">Ezekiel 27:12</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">all the young lions</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-3.htm" title="And she brought up one of her whelps: it became a young lion, and it learned to catch the prey; it devoured men.">Ezekiel 19:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-5.htm" title="Now when she saw that she had waited, and her hope was lost, then she took another of her whelps, and made him a young lion.">Ezekiel 19:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-2.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him, You are like a young lion of the nations, and you are as a whale in the seas: and you came forth with your rivers, and troubled the waters with your feet, and fouled their rivers.">Ezekiel 32:2</a>. The term might be thought not very suitable to a troop of camp followers intent merely on traffic. The term is probably used generally to describe the eminence of these merchant people—hardly to represent them as <span class="ital">thirsting</span> for gain, as lions for prey!<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/38.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Sheba, and Dorian, and the merchants of Tarshish</span> were the great trading communities of the South, East, and West respectively (see on Ezekiel 27:15, 20, 22, 25). <span class="cmt_word">The young lions thereof</span> - <span class="accented">i.e.</span> of Tarshish, not of the other communities (Keil) - were probably intended to represent, not the" authorities" of Tarshish, as Hitzig suggests, but its smaller tradesmen who were equally rapacious with its larger merchants. All are depicted as following in the wake of Gog, like vultures in the rear of an army, and as inquiring whether Gog had come simply for the purpose of destruction or in the hope of trading with the booty he should capture. In this case they intimate their wish to be partakers of the spoil This (Plumptre), rather than the thirst for booty which characterized them (Keil), their question to Gog signified; Schroder's idea, that they purposed ironically to ridicule the smallness of the spoil which would reward so gigantic an expedition, has as little to recommend it as Kliefoth's suggestion, that they designed to intimate their sympathy with Gog's invasion of Israel. </body></html>
