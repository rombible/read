But men, apprehensive of God’s displeasure, and shaken with their own guilt, shall much more shake. But I think it is a very elegant allusive description of those strange troubles and consternation of men’s minds at that day, and so metaphorically to be understood. Mountains may be great ones. Or, possibly, when God comes to judge Gog, he will by his mighty power give the world so great a shake, that it shall be a preface to his dreadful judgment day. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/38.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>So that the fishes of the sea shall shake at my presence,.... From whence it appears that this great shaking shall not be on account of the army of Gog, and the devastations that it shall make; but on account of the powerful presence of God, which will be manifest in the destruction of his army: and what is here said of the shaking of the fishes of the sea, <p>and the fowls of the heaven, and the beast of the field, and all creeping things that creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the earth, must be understood figuratively and hyperbolically, as Kimchi observes, and in allusion to earthquakes, which both shake and terrify all kind of creatures; the blow given to Gog will be so terrible, that all nature will seem to be thrown into a convulsion and agitation by it; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-24.htm">Jeremiah 4:24</a>, <p>and the mountains shall be thrown down; as they are sometimes by earthquakes; and as the mount of Olives will at this time cleave asunder; and perhaps other mountains will, as Kimchi observes, see <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-2.htm">Zechariah 14:2</a>, <p>and the steep places shall fall; the Targum renders the word "towers"; and so the Syriac version, and Piscator: the word signifies stairs or steps (t), such as in a ladder; and is translated "stairs", Sol 2:14 it seems to me to design such mounts as are raised by besiegers of a city, by means of which they may be able to scale the walls of it, which Jarchi suggests; though he says he had heard it said that these, are rocks bending over and hanging, and appear as if they were falling; which agrees with our version; and it may be observed, in some of those precipices, there are like stairs or steps to go up them: <p>and every wall shall fall to the ground: this shows that the words are not to be taken literally, but figuratively; only to express how sensibly the power of God should be felt and perceived by all creatures, and in all parts of the land; since now the Jews will dwell in a land of unwalled villages, and in cities without walls, bars, and gates; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-11.htm">Ezekiel 38:11</a>. <p>(t) "gradus", Munster, Pagninus, Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/38.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the field, and all creeping animals that creep upon the earth, and all the men that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains shall be overturned, and the <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> steep places shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground.</span><p>(n) All means by which man would think to save himself will fail, the affliction in those days will be so great, and the enemies destruction will be so terrible.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/38.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">20</span>. The terror of creation before the majesty of Jehovah shall be universal, and all that is high shall be brought down. The passage agrees with the usual prophetic descriptions of the day of the Lord, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-1.htm" title="The word of the LORD which came to Zephaniah the son of Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.">Zephaniah 1:1</a> <span class="ital">seq</span>.; Isaiah 2-3; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/jeremiah/4-23.htm" title="I beheld the earth, and, see, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light....">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>. It describes Jehovah’s final manifestation of himself in his fury and jealousy. In the earlier prophets this manifestation of his majesty by Jehovah usually precedes or accompanies the final restoration of his people, here it is postponed until long after they have entered upon the rest of God in their own land. In other words that which earlier writers view as one scene, comprising Jehovah’s revelation of himself and the final restoration of his people, is resolved into two, one of which takes place long after the other. The same difference is observable in the New Test. between the representation of the Apocalyptist and that of the other writers.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the steep places</span>] the <span class="bld">clefts</span> of the hills.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>. Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in its land, and defiled it with its way and its doings; like the uncleanness of the unclean woman, was its way before me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>. Then I poured out my fury upon them on account of the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had defiled it through their idols, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>. And scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed in the land; according to their way and their doings I judge them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. And they came to the nations whither they came, and profaned my holy name, for men said of them, "These are Jehovah's people, and they have come out of His land." <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>. And so I had pity upon my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations whither they came. - The address commences with a description of the reasons why God had thrust out His people among the heathen, namely, on account of their sins and idolatrous abominations, by which the Israelites had defiled the land (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-34.htm">Numbers 35:34</a>). Their conduct resembled the most offensive uncleanness, namely, the uncleanness of a woman in her menstruation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), to which the moral depravity of the people had already been compared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a> the consequence of the defiling of the land by the people is introduced with the impression &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is the continuation of the participle &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;; and the participle is expressive of the condition in the past, as we may see from the words '&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The simile in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a> is an explanatory, circumstantial clause. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>, and for '&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. The last clause, "and through their idols they have defiled it," is loosely appended; but it really contains a second reason for the pouring out of the wrath of God upon the people. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a> refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;; but there is no necessity to read &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; on that account. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the subject proposed by Kliefoth, viz., "the report of what had happened to Israel" came to the heathen, which is quite foreign to the connection; for it was not the report concerning Israel, but Israel itself, which came to the heathen, and profaned the sacred name of God. This is not only plainly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>, but has been already stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The fact that the words of the heathen, by which the name of God was profaned, are quoted here, does not prove that it is the heathen nations who are to be regarded as those who profaned the name of God, as Kliefoth imagines. The words, "these are Jehovah's people, and have come out of His (Jehovah's) land," could only contain a profanation of the holy name of God, if their coming out was regarded as involuntary, i.e., as an exile enforced by the power of the heathen; or, on the other hand, if the Israelites themselves had denied the holiness of the people of God through their behaviour among the heathen. Most of the commentators have decided in favour of the former view. Vatablus, for example, gives this explanation: "if their God whom they preach had been omnipotent, He would not have allowed them to be expelled from His land." And we must decide in favour of this exposition, not only because of the parallel passages, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, which support this view; but chiefly on account of the verses which follow, according to which the sanctification of the name of God among the nations consists in the fact that God gathers Israel out of its dispersion among the nations, and leads them back into His own land (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>). Consequently the profanation of His name can only have consisted in the fact that Israel was carried away out of its own land, and scattered in the heathen lands. For, since the heathen acknowledged only national gods, and regarded Jehovah as nothing more than such a national god of Israel, they did not look upon the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the carrying away of the people as a judgment of the almighty and holy God upon His people, but concluded that that catastrophe was a sign of the inability of Jehovah to defend His land and save His people. The only way in which God could destroy this delusion was by manifesting Himself to the heathen as the almighty God and Lord of the whole world through the redemption and glorification of His people. &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;: so I had pity, compassion upon my holy name. The preterite is prophetic, inasmuch as the compassion consists in the gathering of Israel out of the nations, which is announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>. as still in the future. The rendering, "I spared (them) for my holy name's sake" (lxx, Hvernick), is false; for &#1495;&#1502;&#1500; is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, governing the person or the thing toward which the compassion is shown (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).</body></html>
