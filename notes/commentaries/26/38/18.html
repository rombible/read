The expression, <span class="cmt_word">my fury shall come up in my face</span>; or, <span class="accented">my</span> wrath <span class="accented">ascends in rail nose</span>, has parallels in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-8.htm">Ezekiel 24:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-9.htm">Psalm 18:9</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-22.htm">Deuteronomy 32:22</a>, and describes the vehement breathing (inhalation and exhalation) of an angry man through his nose. <span class="cmt_word">The fire of Jehovah's wrath</span> (comp. Ezekiel 21:36; 36:5) should make itself known in that day by <span class="cmt_word">a great shaking in the land of Israel</span>, which can hardly, as Kliefoth surmises, refer to the final judgment, or, as Keil thinks, to the trembling of the whole earth, with all the creatures, before the Lord, who comes to judgment, as in Joel 4:16 and <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4, 5</a>, since the locality in which this convulsion of nature is to happen is expressly defined as "the land of Israel;" but must be understood, with Schroder and Smend, as a figurative description of the terrible overthrow which Jehovah should inflict upon Gog, and which should produce within the heathen mind a feeling of consternation, as if the whole fabric of the globe were falling into ruin. Grounding upon what occurred at Sinai (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/19-16.htm">Exodus 19:16-18</a>), Hebrew writers generally depicted special interpositions of Jehovah as being witnessed to and accompanied by awe-inspiring natural convulsions (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/18-7.htm">Psalm 18:7, 15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/46-2.htm">Psalm 46:2, 3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/55-2.htm">Psalm 55:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-9.htm">Isaiah 13:9-13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-19.htm">Isaiah 24:19-22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-23.htm">Jeremiah 4:23-26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-5.htm">Nahum 1:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>); and in the same manner does Ezekiel delineate Jehovah's intervention in behalf of Israel and against Gog, as so alarming that all living creatures, irrational as well as rational - <span class="cmt_word">fishes of the sea, fowls of the heaven, beasts of the field, creeping things that creep upon the earth</span> (or, <span class="accented">ground - adamah</span>), and men upon the face of the earth; or, <span class="accented">ground</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-26.htm">Genesis 1:26</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-21.htm">Genesis 7:21-23</a>) - should shake at its accompanying manifestations, and that even the mightiest objects in nature, such as the <span class="cmt_word">mountains, steep places</span>, or, "reek-clefts" (Ewald), such elevations as can only be ascended by means of steps as by a ladder (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/songs/2-14.htm">Song of Solomon 2:14</a>), <span class="cmt_word">and walls</span> (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-20.htm">Jeremiah 15:20</a>), including natural ramparts as well as humanly constructed erections, should be overthrown (ver. 20). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/36.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Salvation of Israel Founded upon Its Sanctification<p>Because Israel has defiled its land by its sins, God has scattered the people among the heathen; but because they also profaned His name among the heathen, He will exercise forbearance for the sake of His holy name (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16-21</a>), will gather Israel out of the lands, cleanse it from its sins, and sanctify it by the communication of His Spirit, so that it will walk in His ways (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22-28</a>), and will so bless and multiply it, that both the nations around and Israel itself will know that He is the Lord (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29-38</a>). - This promise is shown by the introductory formula in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16</a> and by the contents to be an independent word of God; but it is substantially connected in the closest manner with the preceding word of God, showing, on the one hand, the motive which prompted God to restore and bless His people;, and, on the other hand, the means by which He would permanently establish the salvation predicted in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34.htm">Ezekiel 34</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1-15</a>. - The kernel of this promise is formed by <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-25.htm">Ezekiel 36:25-28</a>, for which the way is prepared in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17-24</a>, whilst the further extension is contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-29.htm">Ezekiel 36:29-38</a>.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16-21</a><p>The Lord will extend His forbearance, for the sake of His holy name, to the people who have been rejected on account of their sins. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-16.htm">Ezekiel 36:16</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>. Son of man, the house of Israel dwelt in its land, and defiled it with its way and its doings; like the uncleanness of the unclean woman, was its way before me. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>. Then I poured out my fury upon them on account of the blood which they had shed in the land, and because they had defiled it through their idols, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>. And scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed in the land; according to their way and their doings I judge them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. And they came to the nations whither they came, and profaned my holy name, for men said of them, "These are Jehovah's people, and they have come out of His land." <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>. And so I had pity upon my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations whither they came. - The address commences with a description of the reasons why God had thrust out His people among the heathen, namely, on account of their sins and idolatrous abominations, by which the Israelites had defiled the land (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-28.htm">Leviticus 18:28</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-34.htm">Numbers 35:34</a>). Their conduct resembled the most offensive uncleanness, namely, the uncleanness of a woman in her menstruation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/15-19.htm">Leviticus 15:19</a>), to which the moral depravity of the people had already been compared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/64-5.htm">Isaiah 64:5</a>. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a> the consequence of the defiling of the land by the people is introduced with the impression &#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498;. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a>, &#1493;&#1497;&#1496;&#1502;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; is the continuation of the participle &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501;; and the participle is expressive of the condition in the past, as we may see from the words '&#1493;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. The simile in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-17.htm">Ezekiel 36:17</a> is an explanatory, circumstantial clause. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-18.htm">Ezekiel 36:18</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-8.htm">Ezekiel 7:8</a>, and for '&#1506;&#1500; &#1492;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. The last clause, "and through their idols they have defiled it," is loosely appended; but it really contains a second reason for the pouring out of the wrath of God upon the people. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-19.htm">Ezekiel 36:19</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-15.htm">Ezekiel 22:15</a>. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a> refers to &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1497;&#1513;&#1474;&#1512;&#1488;&#1500;; but there is no necessity to read &#1493;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; on that account. It is perfectly arbitrary to supply the subject proposed by Kliefoth, viz., "the report of what had happened to Israel" came to the heathen, which is quite foreign to the connection; for it was not the report concerning Israel, but Israel itself, which came to the heathen, and profaned the sacred name of God. This is not only plainly expressed in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-21.htm">Ezekiel 36:21</a>, but has been already stated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-20.htm">Ezekiel 36:20</a>. The fact that the words of the heathen, by which the name of God was profaned, are quoted here, does not prove that it is the heathen nations who are to be regarded as those who profaned the name of God, as Kliefoth imagines. The words, "these are Jehovah's people, and have come out of His (Jehovah's) land," could only contain a profanation of the holy name of God, if their coming out was regarded as involuntary, i.e., as an exile enforced by the power of the heathen; or, on the other hand, if the Israelites themselves had denied the holiness of the people of God through their behaviour among the heathen. Most of the commentators have decided in favour of the former view. Vatablus, for example, gives this explanation: "if their God whom they preach had been omnipotent, He would not have allowed them to be expelled from His land." And we must decide in favour of this exposition, not only because of the parallel passages, such as <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-16.htm">Numbers 14:16</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-24.htm">Jeremiah 33:24</a>, which support this view; but chiefly on account of the verses which follow, according to which the sanctification of the name of God among the nations consists in the fact that God gathers Israel out of its dispersion among the nations, and leads them back into His own land (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-23.htm">Ezekiel 36:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-24.htm">Ezekiel 36:24</a>). Consequently the profanation of His name can only have consisted in the fact that Israel was carried away out of its own land, and scattered in the heathen lands. For, since the heathen acknowledged only national gods, and regarded Jehovah as nothing more than such a national god of Israel, they did not look upon the destruction of the kingdom of Judah and the carrying away of the people as a judgment of the almighty and holy God upon His people, but concluded that that catastrophe was a sign of the inability of Jehovah to defend His land and save His people. The only way in which God could destroy this delusion was by manifesting Himself to the heathen as the almighty God and Lord of the whole world through the redemption and glorification of His people. &#1493;&#1488;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1506;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1511;: so I had pity, compassion upon my holy name. The preterite is prophetic, inasmuch as the compassion consists in the gathering of Israel out of the nations, which is announced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-22.htm">Ezekiel 36:22</a>. as still in the future. The rendering, "I spared (them) for my holy name's sake" (lxx, Hvernick), is false; for &#1495;&#1502;&#1500; is construed with &#1506;&#1500;, governing the person or the thing toward which the compassion is shown (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-5.htm">Ezekiel 16:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-15.htm">2 Chronicles 36:15</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/36-17.htm">2 Chronicles 36:17</a>).</body></html>
