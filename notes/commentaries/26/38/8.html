The expression “after many days” is the common one to indicate that what is predicted is yet far in the future, and corresponds to the “latter years” of the next clause. The words “thou shalt be visited” are the usual form of expressing a coming judgment. Various ingenious attempts have been made, with no great success, to give the words a different sense here. The supposed difficulty arises from not observing that the whole course of Gog is here viewed together as a single transaction. It is not merely his ultimate destruction, but the steps which led to it, his hostile attacks upon the Church, which are represented as brought about under God’s providence and forming a part of the visitation upon him. It is as if one spoke now of a man’s whole career of sin as a Divine visitation upon the sinner in consequence of his neglect of proffered grace, instead of speaking only of his ultimate punishment.<p><span class= "bld">The land.</span>—Rather, <span class= "ital">a land.</span> Judæa had been long desolated, but was now restored. The word <span class= "ital">people</span> here, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-6.htm" title="Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north quarters, and all his bands: and many people with you.">Ezekiel 38:6</a>, is in the plural and marks the gathering back, not from one, but from many quarters.<p><span class= "bld">Always waste.</span>—Literally, <span class= "ital">continually waste.</span> The mountains of Israel had been by no means <span class= "ital">always</span> waste, but during the period of the captivity had been so constantly. Yet the word is commonly used for a relatively long period, for which the time of the captivity seems too short. It may therefore, with the dispersion among “many peoples” of the previous clause, indicate the time of the later and longer continued dispersion of the Jews. In the last clause “shall dwell” is not to be taken as a future, but as <span class= "bld">a</span> description of the existing condition of the people.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/38.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/38-8.htm" title="After many days you shall be visited: in the latter years you shall come into the land that is brought back from the sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely all of them....">Ezekiel 38:8-9</a></span>. <span class="ital">After many days thou shalt be visited </span>— In the latter days of the Messiah’s kingdom among men, or after a succession of many generations, shall the judgment here mentioned be inflicted by God upon thee. <span class="ital">In the latter years — </span>Or <span class="ital">days, </span>as in the former clause, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-16.htm" title="And you shall come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will bring you against my land, that the heathen may know me, when I shall be sanctified in you, O Gog, before their eyes.">Ezekiel 38:16</a>; that is, toward the end of the world: compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-26.htm" title="And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told is true: why shut you up the vision; for it shall be for many days.">Daniel 8:26</a>. <span class="ital">Thou — </span>Gog, with all thy numbers; <span class="ital">shalt come into the land that is brought back from the sword — </span>The land of the Jews, a people recovered from the countries into which they had been dispersed by the sword of their enemies. The <span class="ital">land, </span>it must be observed, is here put for the people of the land, who are said to be <span class="ital">brought back from the sword, </span>in the same sense in which they are elsewhere styled a <span class="ital">remnant; </span>those being intended that should remain after the various judgments that had fallen upon the nation, and the hardships they had suffered in their several dispersions. <span class="ital">And is gathered out of many people — </span>Among whom they had been scattered: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-13.htm" title="And I will bring them out from the people, and gather them from the countries, and will bring them to their own land, and feed them on the mountains of Israel by the rivers, and in all the inhabited places of the country.">Ezekiel 34:13</a>. <span class="ital">Against the mountains of Israel, which have been always waste — </span>It is already two thousand five hundred years since the ten tribes were carried away out of their own land by Shalmaneser. Certainly the expression, <span class="ital">always, </span>or <span class="ital">perpetually waste, </span>denotes a much longer desolation of the country than that which it suffered during the Babylonish captivity. It seems, all the various desolations of Judea are here included, namely, those by the Assyrians, Babylonians, Antiochus Epiphanes, the Romans, and lastly, as at this time, by the Turks. <span class="ital">But it — </span>The land of Canaan, that is, the people of it, <span class="ital">is brought forth out of the nations — </span>This is a repetition of what was said just before, namely, that Israel had been wonderfully preserved, and restored to their own land, through the particular providence of God; to which is added, <span class="ital">And they shall dwell safely all of them — </span>That is, the same divine power that has delivered and restored them will still continue to protect them. <span class="ital">Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm — </span>Thou shalt come suddenly, and with a mighty and destructive force. <span class="ital">Thou shalt be like a cloud to cover the land</span> — Thy forces shall be so very numerous as to overspread the land like a dark cloud, which makes every thing look melancholy and dismal: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-3.htm" title="For the day is near, even the day of the LORD is near, a cloudy day; it shall be the time of the heathen.">Ezekiel 30:3</a>. The sense of the passage is, that after the return of the Jews and Israelites into their own country, and their having lived there for some time in peace and safety, this enemy will think to take advantage of their security, and fall upon them unexpectedly. “It seems to me,” says Bishop Newcome, “that the prophecy remains to be fulfilled after the future re-establishment of the converted Jews in their own land, when the Mahommedans and pagans will invade them. On this supposition, the subject matter of this and the following chapter is well connected with the promises of distant blessings made toward the close of chap. 37.”<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>38:1-13 These events will be in the latter days.

Probably there is allusion to Isa 24:21, 22, "The host of the high ones &#8230; shall be gathered &#8230; as prisoners &#8230; in the pit &#8230; and after many days shall they be visited." I therefore prefer English Version to Grotius rendering, "Thou shalt get the command" of the expedition. The "after many days" is defined by "in the latter years," that is, in the times just before the coming of Messiah, namely, under Antiochus, before His first coming; under Antichrist, before His second coming.<p>the mountains of Israel &#8230; always waste&#8212;that is, waste during the long period of the captivity, the earnest of the much longer period of Judea's present desolation (to which the language "always waste" more fully applies). This marks the impious atrocity of the act, to assail God's people, who had only begun to recover from their protracted calamities.<p>but it is brought &#8230; and they shall dwell&#8212;rather, "And they (the Israelites) were brought &#8230; dwelt safely" [Fairbairn]. English Version means, "Against Israel, which has been waste, but which (that is, whose people) is now (at the time of the invasion) brought forth out of the nations where they were dispersed, and shall be found by the invader dwelling securely, so as to seem an easy prey to him."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/38.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">After many days:</span> some refer this to the time of the Maccabees; about two hundred years after their return, and finishing the repairs of the city wall; others say after the expiring of the thousand years spoken of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/20-7.htm" title="And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed out of his prison,">Revelation 20:7</a></span>. But certainly the full accomplished days are yet to come, when Gog and Magog shall be destroyed, and so these days are the latter days of the Messiah’s kingdom among men.

The principal controversy raised by these words is as to whether they signify, as Hitzig, Fairbairn, and Kliefoth suppose, that after many days Gog should be entrusted with the command of the aforementioned nations, or, as Ewald, Hengstenberg, Keil, Schroder, Plumptre, and Currey  translate, that Gog, who intended to visit Israel, should himself be visited, in the sense of being punished. In support of the former rendering appeal is taken to <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/7-1.htm">Nehemiah 7:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/12-44.htm">Nehemiah 12:44</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>; but the verb <span class="hebrew">&#x5e4;&#x5b8;&#x5dd;&#x5e7;&#x5d3;</span> when used in this sense is commonly followed by <span class="hebrew">&#x5e2;&#x5b7;&#x5dc;</span> with the accusative of that or those with reference to which or whom the appointment is made or commission issued, and in addition no such commission with reference to these other nations was ever given by God to Gog. In vindication of the second meaning of the words, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-22.htm">Isaiah 24:22</a> and Isaiah 29:6 are ordinarily quoted: while in answer to the objection that it is too soon to talk of punishment for an offense not yet committed, it is customary to reply that, as Jehovah's stirring up of Gog was the first step towards his ultimate overthrow, that stirring up might fairly be described as at least the beginning of his judicial visitation. Havernick's translation, "For a long time thou wilt be missed," <span class="accented">i.e.</span> considered as a people that has utterly vanished," is forced; Smend's is better, "After many days thou shalt be mustered," or numbered. In any case Gog's first movement should take place <span class="cmt_word">in the latter years</span>; literally, <span class="accented">at the end of the years</span> - a frequent prophetic phrase (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-1.htm">Genesis 49:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-14.htm">Numbers 24:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-2.htm">Isaiah 2:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/10-14.htm">Daniel 10:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/4-1.htm">Micah 4:1</a>), here denoting the Messianic era, and should assume the form of an invasion of the land of Israel, which is next described by a threefold characterization. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(1)</span> <span class="cmt_word">As a land brought back from the sword</span>, not in the sense of its people having been made to desist from war, through being henceforth peacefully inclined (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-4.htm">Isaiah 2:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-8.htm">Micah 2:8</a>), or of their having ceased to expect war, because of living ever after securely (ver. 11), but in that of having been recovered from its devastations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3-5</a>); <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(2)</span> as a land whose inhabitants had been <span class="cmt_word">gathered out of many nations</span> - a phrase, which while starting from and including the return from Babylon, manifestly looked beyond that event to the wider dispersion of Israel that should precede the final ingathering; and <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="note_emph">(3)</span> as a land whose <span class="cmt_word">mountains had been always waste</span>; literally, <span class="accented">for a waste continually</span>.

This is apparent from the fact that devastation is to be prepared for Edom, when the whole earth rejoices (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a>), which does not apply to Edom as a small and solitary nation, and still more clearly from the circumstance that, in the promise of salvation in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36.htm">Ezekiel 36</a>, not all Edom alone (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>), but the remnant of the heathen nations generally (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>), are mentioned as the enemies from whose disgrace and oppression Israel is to be delivered. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-2.htm">Ezekiel 35:2</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-17.htm">Ezekiel 13:17</a>. &#1492;&#1512;  is the name given to the mountainous district inhabited by the Edomites, between the Dead Sea and the Elanitic Gulf (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-9.htm">Genesis 36:9</a>). The prophecy is directed against the land; but it also applies to the nation, which brings upon itself the desolation of its land by its hostility to Israel. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>, etc. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1492;, destruction. The sin of Edom mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> is eternal enmity toward Israel, which has also been imputed to the Philistines in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>, but which struck deeper root, in the case of Edom, in the hostile attitude of Esau toward Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-22.htm">Genesis 25:22</a>. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-37.htm">Genesis 27:37</a>), and was manifested, as Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-11.htm">Amos 1:11</a>) has already said, in the constant retention of its malignity toward the covenant nation, so that Edom embraced every opportunity to effect its destruction, and according to the charge brought against it by Ezekiel, gave up the sons of Israel to the sword when the kingdom of Judah fell. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512; &#1506;&#1500; , lit., to pour upon ( - into) the hands of the sword, i.e., to deliver up to the power of the sword (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/63-11.htm">Psalm 63:11</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/18-21.htm">Jeremiah 18:21</a>). &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; recalls to mind &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1488;&#1497;&#1491;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-13.htm">Obadiah 1:13</a>; but here it is more precisely defined by &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; , and limited to the time of the overthrow of the Israelites, when Jerusalem was taken and destroyed by the Chaldeans. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; &#1511;&#1509;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-30.htm">Ezekiel 21:30</a>. On account of this display of its hostility, the Lord will make Edom blood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-6.htm">Ezekiel 35:6</a>). This expression is probably chosen for the play upon the words &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; and &#1488;&#1491;&#1501;. Edom shall become what its name suggests. Making it blood does not mean merely filling it with bloodshed, or reddening the soil with blood (Hitzig); but, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-38.htm">Ezekiel 16:38</a>, turning it as it were into blood, or causing it to vanish therein. Blood shall pursue thee, "as blood-guiltiness invariably pursues a murderer, cries for vengeance, and so delivers him up to punishment" (Hvernick). &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; cannot be the particle employed in swearing, and dependent upon &#1495;&#1497;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, since this particle introduces an affirmative declaration, which would be unsuitable here, inasmuch as &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; in this connection cannot possibly signify blood-relationship. &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; means "if not," in which the conditional meaning of &#1488;&#1501; coincides with the causal, "if" being equivalent to "since." The unusual separation of the &#1500;&#1488; from the verb is occasioned by the fact that &#1491;&#1468;&#1501; is placed before the verb to avoid collision with &#1493;&#1491;&#1468;&#1501;. To hate blood is the same as to have a horror of bloodshed or murder. This threat is carried out still further in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-7.htm">Ezekiel 35:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>. The land of Edom is to become a complete and perpetual devastation; its inhabitants are to be exterminated by war. The form &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492; stands for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492;, and is not to be changed into &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;. Considering the frequency with which &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; occurs, the supposition that we have here a copyist's error is by no means a probable one, and still less probable is the perpetuation of such an error. &#1506;&#1489;&#1512; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-14.htm">Zechariah 7:14</a>. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a> compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>. The Chetib &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492; is scriptio plena for &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, the imperfect Kal of &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in the intransitive sense to be inhabited. The Keri &#1514;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1504;&#1492;, from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, is a needless and unsuitable correction, since &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; does not mean restitui.<p>In the second strophe, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10-15</a>, the additional reason assigned for the desolation of Edom is its longing for the possession of Israel and its land, of which it desired to take forcible possession, although it knew that they belonged to Jehovah, whereby the hatred of Edom toward Israel became contempt of Jehovah. The two peoples and the two lands are Israel and Judah with their lands, and therefore the whole of the holy people and land. &#1488;&#1514; is the sign of the accusative: as for the two peoples, they are mine. The suffix appended to &#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;&#1492; is neuter, and is to be taken as referring generally to what has gone before. &#1493;&#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is a circumstantial clause, through which the desire of Edom is placed in the right light, and characterized as an attack upon Jehovah Himself. Jehovah was there - namely, in the land of which Edom wished to take possession. Kliefoth's rendering, "and yet Jehovah is there," is opposed to Hebrew usage, by changing the preterite &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; into a present; and the objection which he offers to the only rendering that is grammatically admissible, viz., "when Jehovah was there," to the effect "that it attributes to Ezekiel the thought that the Holy Land had once been the land and dwelling-place of God, but was so no longer," calls in question the actual historical condition of things without the slightest reason. For Jehovah had really forsaken His dwelling-place in Canaan before the destruction of the temple, but without thereby renouncing His right to the land; since it was only for the sins of Israel that He had given up the temple, city, and land to be laid waste by the heathen. "But Edom had acted as if Israel existed among the nations without God, and Jehovah had departed from it for ever" (Hvernick); or rather as if Jehovah were a powerless and useless Deity, who had not been able to defend His people against the might of the heathen nations. The Lord will requite Edom for this, in a manner answering to its anger and envy, which had both sprung from hatred. &#1504;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501;, "I will make myself known among them (the Israelites) when I judge thee;" i.e., by the fact that He punishes Edom for its sin, He will prove to Israel that He is a God who does not suffer His people and His possession to be attacked with impunity. From this shall Edom learn that He is Jehovah, the omniscient God, who has heard the revilings of His enemies (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-13.htm">Ezekiel 35:13</a>), and the almighty God, who rewards those who utter such proud sayings according to their deeds (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>). &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; has retained the Kametz on account of the guttural in the first tone, in contrast with &#1504;&#1488;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-18.htm">Nehemiah 9:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/nehemiah/9-26.htm">Nehemiah 9:26</a> (cf. Ewald, 69b). - The expression "mountains of Israel," for the land of Israel, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a>, is occasioned by the antithesis "mountain (mountain-range) of Seir." The Chetib hmmhs is to be pronounced &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;, and to be retained in spite of the Keri. The singular of the neuter gender is used with emphasis in a broken and emotional address, and is to be taken as referring ad sensum to the land. &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492;, to magnify or boast with the mouth, i.e., to utter proud sayings against God, in other words, actually to deride God (compare &#1492;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1500; &#1508;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-12.htm">Obadiah 1:12</a>, which has a kindred meaning). &#1492;&#1506;&#1514;&#1497;&#1512;, used here according to Aramean usage for &#1492;&#1506;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1512;, to multiply, or heap up. In &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1492;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-14.htm">Ezekiel 35:14</a>, &#1499;&#1468; is a particle of time, as it frequently is before infinitives (e.g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/6-20.htm">Joshua 6:20</a>), when all the earth rejoices, not "over thy desolation" (Hitzig), which does not yield any rational thought, but when joy is prepared for all the world, I will prepare devastation for thee. Through this antithesis &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; is limited to the world, with the exception of Edom, i.e., to that portion of the human race which stood in a different relation to God and His people from that of Edom; in other words, which acknowledged the Lord as the true God. It follows from this, that Edom represents the world at enmity against God. In &#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1502;&#1495;&#1514;&#1498; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>) &#1499; is a particle of comparison; and the meaning of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a> is: as thou didst rejoice over the desolation of the inheritance of the house of Israel, so will I cause others to rejoice over thy desolation. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a> we agree with the lxx, Vulgate, Syriac, and others, in taking &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; as the second person, not as the third. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1488;&#1491;&#1493;&#1501; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; serves to strengthen &#1492;&#1512;&#1470;&#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-15.htm">Ezekiel 11:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-10.htm">Ezekiel 36:10</a>). <p>The Restoration and Blessing of Israel<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a>. And thou, son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say, Mountains of Israel, hear the word of Jehovah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because the enemy saith concerning you, Aha! the everlasting heights have become ours for a possession: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>. Therefore prophesy, and say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because, even because they lay you waste, and pant for you round about, so that ye have become a possession to the remnant of the nations, and have come to the talk of the tongue and gossip of the people: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>. Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord Jehovah: Thus saith the Lord Jehovah to the mountains and hills, to the low places and valleys, and to the waste ruins and the forsaken cities, which have become a prey and derision to the remnant of the nations round about; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Truly in the fire of my jealousy I have spoken against the remnant of the nations, and against Edom altogether, which have made my land a possession for themselves in all joy of heart, in contempt of soul, to empty it out for booty. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>. Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains and hills, to the low places and valleys, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, in my jealousy and fury have I spoken, because ye have borne the disgrace of the nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, I, I have lifted up my hand; truly the nations round about you, they shall bear their disgrace. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a>. But ye, ye mountains of Israel, shall put forth your branches, and bear your fruit to my people Israel; for they will soon come. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9</a>. For, behold, I will deal with you, and turn toward you, and ye shall be tilled and sown. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-10.htm">Ezekiel 36:10</a>. I will multiply men upon you, all the house of Israel at once; and the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruins built. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-11.htm">Ezekiel 36:11</a>. And I will multiply upon you man and beast; they shall multiply and be fruitful: and I will make you inhabited as in your former time, and do more good to you than in your earlier days; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a>. I will cause men, my people Israel, to walk upon you; and they shall possess thee, and thou shalt be an inheritance to them, and make them childless no more. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-13.htm">Ezekiel 36:13</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because they say to you, "Thou art a devourer of men, and hast made thy people childless;" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm">Ezekiel 36:14</a>. Therefore thou shalt no more devour men, and no more cause thy people to stumble, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-15.htm">Ezekiel 36:15</a>. And I will no more cause thee to hear the scoffing of the nations, and the disgrace of the nations thou shalt bear no more, and shalt no more cause thy people to stumble, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah.<p>This prophecy is uttered concerning the land of Israel, as is plainly declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>; whereas in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-1.htm">Ezekiel 36:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> the mountains of Israel are mentioned instead of the land, in antithesis to the mountains of Seir (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>; see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-12.htm">Ezekiel 35:12</a>). The promise takes throughout the form of antithesis to the threat against Edom in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>. Because Edom rejoices that the Holy Land, which has been laid waste, has fallen to it for a possession, therefore shall the devastated land be cultivated and sown again, and be inhabited by Israel as in the former time. The heathen nations round about shall, on the other hand, bear their disgrace; Edom, as we have already observed, being expanded, so far as the idea is concerned, into all the heathen nations surrounding Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3-7</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a>, &#1492;&#1488;&#1493;&#1497;&#1489;, the enemy, is mentioned in quite a general manner; and what has already been stated concerning Edom in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-10.htm">Ezekiel 35:10</a>, is her predicted of the enemy. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> this enemy is designated as a remnant of the heathen nations; and it is not till <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a> that it is more precisely defined by the clause, "and all Edom altogether." The &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; round about (&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, compared with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-3.htm">Ezekiel 36:3</a>) are the heathen nations which are threatened with destruction in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a> and 26, on account of their malicious rejoicing at the devastation of Jerusalem and Judah. This serves to explain the fact that these nations are designated as &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1514; &#1492;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, the rest, or remnant of the heathen nations, which presupposes that the judgment has fallen upon them, and that only a remnant of them is left, which remnant desires to take possession of the devastated land of Israel. The epithet applied to this land, &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, everlasting, i.e., primeval heights, points back to the &#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1506;&#1493;&#1514; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/49-26.htm">Genesis 49:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/33-15.htm">Deuteronomy 33:15</a>, and is chosen for the purpose of representing the land as a possession secured to the people of Israel by primeval promises, in consequence of which the attempt of the enemy to seize upon this land has become a sin against the Lord God. The indignation at such a sin is expressed in the emotional character of the address. As Ewald has aptly observed, "Ezekiel is seized with unusual fire, so that after the brief statement in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-2.htm">Ezekiel 36:2</a> 'therefore' is repeated five times, the charges brought against these foes forcing themselves in again and again, before the prophecy settles calmly upon the mountains of Israel, to which it was really intended to apply." For &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1506;&#1503;, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13-10.htm">Ezekiel 13:10</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; is an infinitive Kal, formed after the analogy of the verbs &#1492;'&#1500; (cf. Ewald, 238e), from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, to be waste, to devastate, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/8-13.htm">Daniel 8:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/9-27.htm">Daniel 9:27</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/daniel/12-11.htm">Daniel 12:11</a>, and is not to be taken in the sense of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/42-14.htm">Isaiah 42:14</a>, as Hitzig supposes. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, to pant for a thing; here it is equivalent to snapping at anything. This is required by a comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, where &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; corresponds to &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; &#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1507;, and &#1500;&#1500;&#1506;&#1490; to '&#1514;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; &#1506;&#1500; &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;. In the connection &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1514; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1513;&#1474;&#1508;&#1492; signifies the lip as an organ of speech, or, more precisely, the words spoken; and &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503;, the tongue, is personified, and stands for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/140-12.htm">Psalm 140:12</a>), a tongue-man, i.e., a talker.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a> the idea expressed in "the mountains of Israel" is expanded into mountains, hills, lowlands, and valleys (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-12.htm">Ezekiel 31:12</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a>); and this periphrastic description of the land is more minutely defined by the additional clause, "waste ruins and forsaken cities." &#1488;&#1501; &#1500;&#1488; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-5.htm">Ezekiel 36:5</a> is the particle used in oaths (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>, etc.); and the perfect &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is not merely prophetic, but also a preterite. God has already uttered a threatening word concerning the nations round about in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>, 26, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>; and here He once more declares that they shall bear their disgrace. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473; &#1511;&#1504;&#1488;&#1495; is the fiery jealousy of wrath. &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1488; is an Aramean form for &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-15.htm">Ezekiel 35:15</a>). For &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>. In the expression &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; noisserp, which has been rendered in various ways, we agree with Gesenius and others in regarding &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; as an Aramean form of the infinitive of &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, with the meaning to empty out, which is confirmed by the Syriac; for &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; cannot be a substantive, on account of the &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;; and Hitzig's conjecture, that &#1500;&#1489;&#1494; should be pointed &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, and the clause rendered "to plunder its produce," is precluded by the fact that the separation of the preposition &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;, by the insertion of a word between, is unexampled, to say nothing of the fact that &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; does not mean produce at all. The thought expressed in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-7.htm">Ezekiel 36:7</a> is the following: because Israel has hitherto borne the contempt of the heathen, the heathen shall now bear their own contempt. The lifting of the hand is a gesture employed in taking an oath, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-6.htm">Ezekiel 20:6</a>, etc. But the land of Israel is to receive a blessing. This blessing is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-8.htm">Ezekiel 36:8</a> in general terms, as the bearing of fruit by the mountains, i.e., by the land of Israel; and its speedy commencement is predicted. It is then depicted in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9</a>. In the clause &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1511;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, the Israelites are not to be regarded as the subject, as Kliefoth supposes, in which case their speedy return from exile would be announced. The &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; shows that this cannot be the meaning; for it is immediately preceded by '&#1500;&#1506;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;' yb , which precludes the supposition that, when speaking of the mountains, Ezekiel had the inhabitants in his mind. The promised blessings are the subject, or the branches and fruits, which the mountains are to bear. Nearly all the commentators have agreed in adopting this explanation of the words, after the analogy of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/56-1.htm">Isaiah 56:1</a>. With the &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-9.htm">Ezekiel 36:9</a> the carrying out of the blessing promised is appended in the form of a reason assigned for the general promise. The mountains shall be cultivated, the men upon them, viz., all Israel, multiplied, the desolated cities rebuilt, so that Israel shall dwell in the land as in the former time, and be fruitful and blessed. This promise was no doubt fulfilled in certain weak beginnings after the return of a portion of the people under Zerubbabel and Ezra; but the multiplying and blessing, experienced by those who returned from Babylon, did not take place till long after the salvation promised here, and more especially in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12-15</a>.<p>According to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a>, the land is to become the inheritance of the people Israel, and will no more make the Israelites childless, or (according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm">Ezekiel 36:14</a>) cause them to stumble; and the people are no more to bear the contempt of the heathen. But that portion of the nation which returned from exile not only continued under the rule of the heathen, but had also in various ways to bear the contempt of the heathen still; and eventually, because Israel not only stumbled, but fell very low through the rejection of its Saviour, it was scattered again out of the land among the heathen, and the land was utterly wasted...until this day. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-12.htm">Ezekiel 36:12</a> the masculine suffix attached to &#1493;&#1497;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1498; refers to the land regarded as &#1492;&#1512;, which is also the subject to &#1492;&#1497;&#1497;&#1514; and &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1505;&#1507;. It is not till <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-13.htm">Ezekiel 36:13</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm">Ezekiel 36:14</a>, where the idea of the land becomes so prominent, that the feminine is used. &#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1501;, to make them (the Israelites) childless, or bereaved, is explained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-13.htm">Ezekiel 36:13</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-14.htm">Ezekiel 36:14</a> by &#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514;, devouring men. That the land devours its inhabitants, is what the spies say of the land of Canaan in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/13-32.htm">Numbers 13:32</a>; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-19.htm">2 Kings 2:19</a> is it affirmed of the district of Jericho that it causes &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1514;, i.e., miscarriages, on account of its </body></html>
