Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil. Those who indulge therein must expect to perish.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/28.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The uncircumcised - The pagan idolaters as opposed to the covenant-people.<p>The prophecy against the prince of Tyre. Throughout the east the majesty and glory of a people were collected in the person of their monarch, who in some nations was worshipped as a god. The prince is here the embodiment of the community. Their glory is his glory, their pride his pride. The doom of Tyre could not be complete without denunciation of the prince of Tyre. Idolatrous nations and idolatrous kings were, in the eyes of the prophet, antagonists to the true God. In them was embodied the principle of evil opposing itself to the divine government of the world. Hence, some of the fathers saw upon the throne, not simply a hostile monarch, but "the Prince of this world, spiritual wickedness (or wicked spirits) in high places." Whenever evil in any way domineers over good, there is a "prince of Tyrus," against whom God utters His voice. The "mystery of iniquity is ever working, and in that working we recognize the power of Satan whom God condemns and will destroy.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-10.htm">Ezekiel 28:10</a>The uncircumcised - The pagan idolaters as opposed to the covenant-people. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/28.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. deaths of &#8230; uncircumcised&#8212;that is, such a death as the uncircumcised or godless heathen deserve; and perhaps, also, such as the uncircumcised inflict, a great ignominy in the eyes of a Jew (1Sa 31:4); a fit retribution on him who had scoffed at the circumcised Jews.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The deaths: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-8.htm" title="They shall bring you down to the pit, and you shall die the deaths of them that are slain in the middle of the seas.">Ezekiel 28:8</a></span>.

Deprivation of burial did not hinder the dead persons from descending into Sheol, the place of the dead, but the dishonour done them here followed them there, and they were subject to reproach. Cf. the same representation <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/14-19.htm" title="But you are cast out of your grave like an abominable branch, and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a carcass trodden under feet....">Isaiah 14:19-20</a>, where it is an entire misconception to consider “stones of the pit” to refer to a paved mausoleum, and thus a sumptuous burial.

The words receive a special force from the fact that the Phoenicians practiced circumcision before their intercourse with the Greeks (Herod., 2:104). </body></html>
