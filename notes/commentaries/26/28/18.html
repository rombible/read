The main thought, however, is the former one, and it is in accordance with this that the fire is represented as going forth to consume the king. Many of the Hebrew manuscripts have <span class= "ital">sanctuary</span> in the singular.<p><span class= "bld">By the iniquity of thy traffick.—</span>Here, as so often in other cases, the sin is represented as consisting in the abuse of the very blessings which God had given, and this sin as leading directly to its own punishment. No fact is more striking in history, whether of Israel or of the heathen, than that the gifts of God, which should have been to their blessing and His glory, are perverted by the sinfulness of man: first to their own guilt, and then, in consequence, to their ruin.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-20.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 28:20-26</a> constitute another distinct prophecy, of which <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-20.htm" title="Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying,">Ezekiel 28:20-24</a> are occupied with the denunciation of judgment upon Zidon, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-25.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; When I shall have gathered the house of Israel from the people among whom they are scattered, and shall be sanctified in them in the sight of the heathen, then shall they dwell in their land that I have given to my servant Jacob.">Ezekiel 28:25-26</a> with promises to Israel. There are several obvious reasons, besides that of making up the number of the nations to seven, why at least a word of prophecy should have been directed especially against Zidon, notwithstanding her forming a part of Phœnicia and contributing to the mariners of Tyre (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm" title="The inhabitants of Zidon and Arvad were your mariners: your wise men, O Tyrus, that were in you, were your pilots.">Ezekiel 27:8</a>). In the first place, Zidon (situated about twenty-five miles north of Tyre) was the more ancient city from which Tyre had sprung, and always maintained her independence. Hence she might seem not to be exposed to the judgment of God upon Tyre, unless especially mentioned. Then also Zidon (rather than Tyre) had been peculiarly the source of corrupting idolatrous influences upon Israel. This had begun as early as the times of the Judges (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-6.htm" title="And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and forsook the LORD, and served not him.">Judges 10:6</a>); it had been continued and increased in the days of Solomon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/11-33.htm" title="Because that they have forsaken me, and have worshipped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Zidonians, Chemosh the god of the Moabites, and Milcom the god of the children of Ammon, and have not walked in my ways, to do that which is right in my eyes, and to keep my statutes and my judgments, as did David his father.">1Kings 11:33</a>); it reached its consummation under the reign of Ahab, who married Jezebel, the daughter of the king of Zidon and high priest of Baal (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/16-31.htm" title="And it came to pass, as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, that he took to wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Zidonians, and went and served Baal, and worshipped him.">1Kings 16:31</a>), and who set up the worship of Baal as the state religion of Israel. That this influence was still powerful in Judah also in the days of Ezekiel is plain from the reference to the Thammuz worship in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-14.htm" title="Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD's house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.">Ezekiel 8:14</a>.<p>There is only one mention (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/10-12.htm" title="The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did oppress you; and you cried to me, and I delivered you out of their hand.">Judges 10:12</a>) of the Zidonians as coming into armed conflict with Israel; but they had rejoiced in her fall. As this prophecy closes the circle of the nations who had thus exulted in the destruction of Jerusalem, there is appropriately placed at the end a promise of restoration to Israel when all these judgments upon her enemies shall have been accomplished.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/28.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-18.htm" title="You have defiled your sanctuaries by the multitude of your iniquities, by the iniquity of your traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the middle of you, it shall devour you, and I will bring you to ashes on the earth in the sight of all them that behold you....">Ezekiel 28:18-19</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries </span>— Thy throne, palace, judgment-seats.

Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil.

This may be applied to the places of religious worship among the Papists, their churches; which, instead of being adorned, are defiled with their images and image worship, and other acts of superstition and will worship: <p>by the iniquity of thy traffic; as by bringing in ill gotten goods into the sacred places of Tyre, as they were accounted, so by selling pardons; praying souls out of purgatory for money; by simony, or buying and selling ecclesiastical benefices; and such like spiritual merchandise in Roman churches: <p>therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee; sin, and the punishment of it, as Kimchi; which, for sin committed in the midst of them, should consume as fire; or some from among themselves, that should stir up and cause internal divisions, which should issue in their ruin; as the unclean spirit that shall go out of the mouth of the beast, dragon, and false prophet, to gather the antichristian kings to battle, will end in their ruin, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/16-14.htm">Revelation 16:14</a>.

It is doubtful if the word can bear this meaning. LXX. reads: because of the multitude of thine iniquities in the wrong of thy traffic <span class="ital">I have profaned</span> thy sanctuaries, and I have brought forth a fire. The tenses are all in the perfect of threatening, and the threats here pass away from the prince and apply more to the city. On “fire” cf. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm" title="And fire is gone out of a rod of her branches, which has devoured her fruit, so that she has no strong rod to be a scepter to rule.

Any reference to the Phenix, consumed in a self-kindled fire, has little probability.

In Palestine (Arabia and Syria) the east wind is characterized by continued gusts; and if it rises into a tempest, it generally causes great damage on account of the violence of the gusts (see Wetzstein in Delitzsch's commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/27-1.htm">Job 27:1</a>). Like a ship broken in pieces by the storm, Tyre with all its glory sinks into the depths of the sea. The repetition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1489; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-27.htm">Ezekiel 27:27</a> forms an effective contrast to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>; just as the enumeration of all the possessions of Tyre, which fall with the ship into the heart of the sea, does to the wealth and glory in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-25.htm">Ezekiel 27:25</a>. They who manned the ship also perish with the cargo, - "the seamen," i.e., sailors, rowers, repairers of leaks (calkers), also the merchants on board, and the fighting men who defended the ship and its goods against pirates, - the whole qa&#770;ha&#770;l, or gathering of people, in the ship. The difficult expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1511;&#1492;&#1500;&#1498; can only be taken as an explanatory apposition to &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;: all the men who are in thee, namely, in the multitude of people in thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-28.htm">Ezekiel 27:28</a>. When the vessel is wrecked, the managers of the ship raise such a cry that the migresho&#772;th tremble. &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/35-2.htm">Numbers 35:2</a> for the precincts around the Levitical cities, which were set apart as pasture ground for the flocks; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm">Ezekiel 45:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-17.htm">Ezekiel 48:17</a>, for the ground surrounding the holy city. Consequently &#1502;&#1490;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1514; cannot mean the suburbs of Tyre in the passage before us, but must signify the open places on the mainland belonging to Tyre, i.e., the whole of its territory, with the fields and villages contained therein. The rendering "fleet," which Ewald follows the Vulgate in adopting, has nothing to support it.<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29</a>. The ruin of this wealthy and powerful metropolis of the commerce of the world produces the greatest consternation among all who sail upon the sea, so that they forsake their ships, as if they were no longer safe in them, and leaving them for the land, bewail the fall of Tyre with deepest lamentation. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1497;&#1506; with &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/26-7.htm">Psalm 26:7</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/15-19.htm">1 Chronicles 15:19</a>, etc. For the purpose of depicting the lamentation as great and bitter in the extreme, Ezekiel groups together all the things that were generally done under such circumstances, viz., covering the head with dust (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-6.htm">Joshua 7:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/4-12.htm">1 Samuel 4:12</a>; and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-12.htm">Job 2:12</a>) and ashes (&#1492;&#1514;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;, to strew, or cover oneself, not to roll oneself: see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-10.htm">Micah 1:10</a>); shaving a bald place (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-18.htm">Ezekiel 7:18</a> and the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/1-16.htm">Micah 1:16</a>); putting on sackcloth; loud, bitter weeping (&#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1512;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/7-11.htm">Job 7:11</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/10-1.htm">Job 10:1</a>); and singing an mournful dirge (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-32.htm">Ezekiel 27:32</a>.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, in lamento eorum; &#1504;&#1497; contracted from &#1504;&#1492;&#1497; (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/9-17.htm">Jeremiah 9:17-18</a>; cf. &#1492;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-10.htm">Ezekiel 2:10</a>). The reading adopted by the lxx, Theodot., Syr., and eleven Codd. (&#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;) is unsuitable, as there is no allusion to sons, but the seamen themselves raise the lamentation. The correction proposed by Hitzig, &#1489;&#1468;&#1508;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, is altogether inappropriate. The exclamation, Who is like Tyre! is more precisely defined by &#1499;&#1468;&#1491;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, like the destroyed one in the midst of the sea. &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, participle Pual, with the &#1502; dropt, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/2_kings/2-10.htm">2 Kings 2:10</a>, etc. (vid., Ges. 52. 2, Anm. 6). It is quite superfluous to assume that there was a noun &#1491;&#1468;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; signifying destruction. '&#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1488;&#1514; &#1506;&#1494;&#1489; has been aptly explained by Hitzig; "inasmuch as thy wares sprang out of the sea, like the plants and field-fruits out of the soil" (the selection of the word &#1492;&#1513;&#1474;&#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468; also suggested this simile); "not as being manufactured at Tyre, and therefore in the sea, but because the sea floated the goods to land for the people in the ships, and they satisfied the desire of the purchasers." Tyre satisfied peoples and enriched kings with its wares, not only by purchasing from them and paying for their productions with money or barter, but also by the fact that the Tyrians gave a still higher value to the raw material by the labour which they bestowed upon them. &#1492;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1498; in the plural is only met with here. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-34.htm">Ezekiel 27:34</a>.
