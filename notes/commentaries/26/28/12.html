The LXX. render this, <span class="greekheb">Συ αποσφραγισμα ομοιωσεως</span>, <span class="greekheb">και στεφανος καλλους</span>, <span class="ital">Thou art the seal of likeness, and crown of beauty. </span>To the same purpose the Vulgate, <span class="ital">Tu signaculum similitudinis, plenus sapientia, perfectus decore: </span>that is, says Lowth, “Thou art the image of God, an exact impression taken from that great copy.

The expression, as well as the whole context, alludes to the complete happiness which Adam enjoyed in paradise, before his apostacy and fall.” <span class="ital">Every precious stone was thy covering — </span>Not only was thy crown adorned with the choicest jewels, but thou wast arrayed with royal robes, enriched with gold and precious stones of all sorts. There is probably an allusion here to the precious stones which were placed in the high-priest’s breast-plate, as the next verse alludes to the cherubim over the mercy-seat. Accordingly the LXX. enlarge the number of the stones here mentioned from nine to twelve, and place them in the same order in which they are ranked <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/28-17.htm" title="And you shall set in it settings of stones, even four rows of stones: the first row shall be a sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this shall be the first row.">Exodus 28:17</a>, &c. <span class="ital">The workmanship of thy tabrets, &c.,was prepared in thee — </span>Or, <span class="ital">for thee, in the day thou wast created — </span>The highest expressions of joy, such as are the sounding of all sorts of musical instruments, ushered thee into the world, according to the usual practice at the birth of great princes; and ever since thou hast been brought up in the choicest delicacies which a royal palace or a luxurious city could furnish.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/28.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>28:1-19 Ethbaal, or Ithobal, was the prince or king of Tyre; and being lifted up with excessive pride, he claimed Divine honours. Pride is peculiarly the sin of our fallen nature. Nor can any wisdom, except that which the Lord gives, lead to happiness in this world or in that which is to come. The haughty prince of Tyre thought he was able to protect his people by his own power, and considered himself as equal to the inhabitants of heaven. If it were possible to dwell in the garden of Eden, or even to enter heaven, no solid happiness could be enjoyed without a humble, holy, and spiritual mind. Especially all spiritual pride is of the devil.

Who is before called the prince of Tyre; and who he was See Gill on <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>, the bishop of Rome was first only a "nagid", a prince, ruler, governor, and leader in the church; afterwards he became a king, a head, even over other kings, princes, and states; perhaps this may also point to his twofold power, secular and ecclesiastical, and so he is represented by two beasts, <a href="http://biblehub.com/revelation/13-1.htm">Revelation 13:1</a>, here a lamentation or funeral ditty is ordered to be taken up and said for him, to denote his certain destruction and ruin; though some have thought the fall of the angels, and others the fall of Adam, is referred to; several passages are interpreted of Adam in the Talmud (l): <p>and say unto him, thus saith the Lord God, thou sealest up the sum; or "pattern" (m); of everything that is excellent; thou art in all things, consummately so, as that nothing could be added; that is, in his own esteem and account. Junius thinks it refers to the sealing of goods exported, for which a duty was to be paid, without doing which merchandise was not allowed. Antichrist would not suffer any to buy or sell but such as receive his mark or seal on their right hand, or in their forehead, <a href="https://biblehub.com/revelation/13-16.htm">Revelation 13:16</a>. Cocceius renders it, "the sealer of the measure" (n); and takes it to be an allusion to the custom of sealing measures, used in buying and selling; and that it respects the man of sin, who takes upon him the power of making rules and canons for faith and practice: <p>full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty; a most accomplished man for parts and person in his own conceit: antichrist assumes to himself a perfect knowledge of the Scriptures, and sets up himself as an infallible judge of controversies; and glories in the splendour and order of his church, and the government of it. <p>(l) T.

LXX. of Ezek. reserves the term “king” for the rulers of Babylon and Egypt, except in general expressions like “kings of the earth,” or, of the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-33.htm" title="When your wares went forth out of the seas, you filled many people; you did enrich the kings of the earth with the multitude of your riches and of your merchandise.">Ezekiel 27:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-35.htm" title="All the inhabitants of the isles shall be astonished at you, and their kings shall be sore afraid, they shall be troubled in their countenance.">Ezekiel 27:35</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-10.htm" title="Yes, I will make many people amazed at you, and their kings shall be horribly afraid for you, when I shall brandish my sword before them; and they shall tremble at every moment, every man for his own life, in the day of your fall.">Ezekiel 32:10</a>).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">sealest up the sum</span>] The term “sum” only again ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm" title="You son of man, show the house to the house of Israel, that they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure the pattern.">Ezekiel 43:10</a> of the construction or idea of the temple, there rendered “pattern.” The verb is used of the work of God in ordering creation by weight and measure, <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/28-25.htm" title="To make the weight for the winds; and he weighs the waters by measure.">Job 28:25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/40-12.htm" title="Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales, and the hills in a balance?...">Isaiah 40:12-13</a>. The phrase “thou sealest” is pointed as part. <span class="ital">art the sealer of</span>, but some MSS. and the ancient Versions read <span class="ital">art the sealring of</span>. To “seal” has always the natural sense, or means to close up, fasten up; it seems nowhere to mean to round off, complete or consummate. LXX. omits “full of wisdom,” and the first words are in parallelism to “the perfection of beauty.” This would suggest that the first words describe what the prince is or was, not what he did. The term rendered “sum” may mean <span class="ital">symmetry</span> (perfection), and the whole: <span class="ital">thou wast the sealring of symmetry</span> (perfection), <span class="ital">and the perfection of beauty</span>. In this case the prince is compared to a sealring of exquisite workmanship. On the other hand if part. be read, “thou wast the sealer of symmetry,” the conception of something impressing symmetry (upon all things) seems expressed. There might then be an allusion to the Wisdom; cf. the comparison of light to a seal <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/38-14.htm" title="It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.">Job 38:14</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">12–19</span>. Lament over the fall of the prince of Tyre<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>The passage is of extreme difficulty partly from the obscurity of several expressions in it, which do not occur again, and partly from allusions not now intelligible. The general drift of the passage is plain. (1) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-12.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation on the king of Tyrus, and say to him, Thus said the Lord GOD; You seal up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty....">Ezekiel 28:12-15</a></span>. The prince of Tyre is represented as a glorious being placed in Eden the garden of God. He was the perfection of beauty, was set on the mountain of God, and was perfect in his ways from the day he was created till iniquity was found in him. (2) <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-16.htm" title="By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire....">Ezekiel 28:16-19</a></span>. He fell from his high place through pride because of the multitude of his riches, and was therefore expelled from the garden of God.—Towards the end of the passage the allegory of a being in paradise is departed from and the actual circumstances of the prince and his city are more literally referred to. The text of LXX. diverges in important particulars from the Heb.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span>Particular difficulties, however, are numerous. 1. The expression “sealest up the sum,” <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm" title="Son of man, take up a lamentation on the king of Tyrus, and say to him, Thus said the Lord GOD; You seal up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty.">Ezekiel 28:12</a></span> is very obscure. For the participle “sealest” the ancient versions read signet or <span class="ital">ring</span>. That there is reference to a ring seems plain from <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm" title="You have been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold: the workmanship of your tabrets and of your pipes was prepared in you in the day that you were created.">Ezekiel 28:13</a></span>. 2. Again the cherub is referred to. There can be no doubt that the prophet has in his mind the story of Paradise (Genesis 2, 3). The cherub naturally belongs to the Paradise of God. In the Heb. text, as at present pointed (though the pointing is very anomalous) the prince is compared to the cherub, or said to be or have been the cherub. The text, however, permits the reading <span class="ital">with</span> or <span class="ital">beside</span> the cherub (<span class="ital">v</span>, 14, so LXX.). The prince sinned and was expelled from the garden of God where he was placed. The idea of the prophet is that pride and self-deification was the sin of the prince and caused his expulsion. This, however, in Ezek. is the sin of all the foreign princes or nations, Egypt no less than Tyre, and cannot be held part of a tradition of the Fall, or of paradise. That the prophet does refer to a fall and expulsion from paradise or destruction of the transgressor seems plain (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/28-16.htm" title="By the multitude of your merchandise they have filled the middle of you with violence, and you have sinned: therefore I will cast you as profane out of the mountain of God: and I will destroy you, O covering cherub, from the middle of the stones of fire....">Ezekiel 28:16-17</a></span>). But any fall of the cherub is not hinted at anywhere in the Old Test.; on the contrary the cherubs are represented as watchers and protectors of the garden of God against men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/3-24.htm" title="So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.">Genesis 3:24</a>). There are references in the Old Test. to the sin of higher beings (e.g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-1.htm" title="And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born to them,">Genesis 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/24-21.htm" title="And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth on the earth.">Isaiah 24:21</a>), but the prophet’s allusions to the cherubs in other places make it very improbable that he should think of them as sinning. 3. It is probable, therefore, that it is the history of the first man that floats before his mind. The term “created” applied to the prince would hardly be used of the cherub. It is not unlikely, however, that Ezek. is in possession of traditions regarding Paradise more ample than those in Gen. or different from them. At the same time the divergences may be due to his own tendency to idealize. The prince of Tyre is represented as wiser than all men, even than Daniel; and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/job/15-7.htm" title="Are you the first man that was born? or were you made before the hills?...">Job 15:7-8</a> the first man born is spoken of as possessing supernatural wisdom. The prophet might have before his mind that Wisdom which was the first of God’s works of old (Proverbs 8), and his architect in creation, and who realized herself in the symmetry of the universe.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/28.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 12.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thou sealest up the sum</span>, etc. The noun is found only there and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a>, where it is translated "pattern," but is cognate with the word rendered" tale" (equivalent to "measure") of <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/5-13.htm">Exodus 5:13</a>, and "measure" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-11.htm">Ezekiel 45:11</a>. The probable meaning is, <span class="accented">Thou settest the seal to thy completeness</span> (<span class="accented">perfection</span>). Thou deemest that thou hast attained the consummation of all beauty and wisdom. The LXX. and the Vulgate give, "Thou art a seal;" and this suggests a parallelism with Jeremiah's works to Coniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-24.htm">Jeremiah 22:24</a>). The words were, of course, written with a keen irony. This was what the King of Tyro thought of himself. </body></html>
