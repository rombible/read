Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Syria - "Aram" here included Mesopotamia; and Babylon was famous for its precious stones.

So the Targum, <p>"purple clothes, and wrought with a needle, and linen of different colours;'' <p>and of such they made their sails, tilts, and tents; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>. <p>And coral, and agate; the first is a sea plant. <p>"This opinion is now so well established, that all other sentiments seem almost precluded. P. Kircher supposes entire forests of it at the bottom of the sea; and M. Tournefort, that able botanist, maintains, that it evidently multiplies by seed, though neither its flower nor seed be known. However, the count de Marsigli has discovered some parts therein, which seem to serve the purpose of seeds and flower, it vegetates the contrary way to all other plants; its foot adhering to the top of the grotto, and its branches shooting downwards, there are properly but three kinds of coral, red, white, and black; the white is the rarest and most esteemed; but it is the red that is ordinarily used in medicine; the places for fishing it are the Persian gulf, Red sea, coasts of Africa towards the bastion of France, the isles of Majorca and Corsica, and the coasts of Provence and Catalonia (g).'' <p>Perhaps the Syrians might have theirs from the Red sea, or the Mediterranean. The other, the "agate", is a precious stone, the same with the "achates", first found in Sicily, as Isidore says (h), by a river of the same name; is of a black colour, according to him, having in the middle black and white circles joined and variegated; but they are of different colours, and of different degrees of transparency. The word is variously rendered; by some the ruby; by others the carbuncle; by others the chalcedony; and by others crystal; it is hard to say what is meant. Now the Phoenicians or Tyrians were so deeply engaged in trade with the Syrians, that it became a common proverb, the Phonicians against the Syrians (i); when like are set against like, as the Egyptians against the Egyptians, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-2.htm">Isaiah 19:2</a>. <p>(f) Vid.

Byssus in embroidery from Egypt was thy sail, to serve thee for a banner; blue and red purple from the islands of Elishah was thine awning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy skilful men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy sailors. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>. The elders of Gebal and its skilful men were with thee to repair thy leaks; all the ships of the sea and their mariners were in thee to barter thy goods. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>. Persian and Lydian and Libyan were in thine army, thy men of war; shield and helmet they hung up in thee; they gave brilliancy to thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>. The sons of Arvad and thine army were upon thy walls round about, and brave men were upon they towers; they hung up their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. - The lamentation commences with an address to Tyre, in which its favourable situation for purposes of trade, and the perfect beauty of which she was conscious, are placed in the foreground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>). Tyre is sitting, or dwelling, at the approaches of the sea. &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501;, approaches or entrances of the sea, are harbours into which ships sail and from which they depart, just as &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; sa t, the gate of the city, it both entrance and exit. This description does not point to the city on the mainland, or Old Tyre, but answers exactly to Insular Tyre with its two harbours.<p>(Note: Insular Tyre possessed two harbours, a northern one called the Sidonian, because it was on the Sidonian side, and one on the opposite or south-eastern side, which was called the Egyptian harbour from the direction in which it pointed. The Sidonian was the more celebrated of the two, and consisted of an inner harbour, situated within the wall of the city, and an outer one, formed by a row of rocks, which lay at a distance of about three hundred paces to the north-west of the island, and ran parallel to the opposite coast of the mainland, so as to form a roadstead in which ships could anchor (vid., Arrian, ii. 20; Strabo, xvi. 2. 23). This northern harbour is still held by the city of Sur, whereas the Egyptian harbour with the south-eastern portion of the island has been buried by the sand driven against the coasts by the south winds, so that even the writers of the Middle Ages make no allusion to it. (See Movers, Phnizier, II. 1, pp. 214ff.).)<p>&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;, with the connecting i, which is apparently confounded here after the Aramaean fashion with the i of the feminine pronoun, and has therefore been marked by the Masora as superfluous (vid., Ewald, 211b). The combination of &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; with '&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512; may be accounted for from the primary meaning of &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;, to travel about as a merchant: thou who didst go to the nations on many shores to carry on thy trade. Tyre itself considers that she is perfect in her beauty, partly on account of her strong position in the sea, and partly because of her splendid edifices.<p>(Note: Curtius, iv. 2: Tyrus et claritate et magnitudine ante omnes urbes Syriae Phoenicesque memorabilis. (Cf. Strabo, xvi. 2.22.))<p>In the description which follows of this beauty and glory, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a> onwards, Tyre is depicted allegorically as a beautiful ship, splendidly built and equipped throughout, and its destruction is afterwards represented as a shipwreck occasioned by the east wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>.).<p>(Note: Jerome recognised this allegory, and has explained it correctly as follows: "He (the prophet) speaks &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, as though addressing a ship, and points out its beauty and the abundance of everything. Then, after having depicted all its supplies, he announces that a storm will rise, and the south wind (auster) will blow, by which great waves will be gathered up, and the vessel will be wrecked. In all this he is referring to the overthrow of the city by King Nabuchodonosor," etc. Rashi and others give the same explanation.)<p>The words, "in the heart of the seas is thy territory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a>), are equally applicable to the city of Tyre and to a ship, the building of which is described in what follows. The comparison of Tyre to a ship was very naturally suggested by the situation of the city in the midst of the sea, completely surrounded by water. As a ship, it must of necessity be built of wood. The shipbuilders selected the finest kinds of wood for the purpose; cypresses of Antilibanus for double planks, which formed the sides of the vessel, and cedar of Lebanon for the mast. Senir, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>, was the Amoritish name of Hermon or Antilibanus, whereas the Sidonians called it Sirion. On the other hand, Senir occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>, and Shenir in Sol 4:8, in connection with Hermon, where they are used to denote separate portions of Antilibanus. Ezekiel evidently uses Senir as a foreign name, which had been retained to his own time, whereas Sirion had possibly become obsolete, as the names had both the same meaning (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>). The naming of the places from which the several materials were obtained for the fitting out of the ship, serve to heighten the glory of its construction and give an ideal character to the picture. All lands have contributed their productions to complete the glory and might of Tyre. Cypress-wood was frequently used by the ancients for buildings and (according to Virgil, Georg. ii. 443) also for ships, because it was exempt from the attacks of worms, and was almost imperishable, and yet very light (Theophr. Hist. plant. v. 8; Plinii Hist. nat. xvi. 79). &#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, a dual form, like &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>, double-planks, used for the two side-walls of the ship. For oars they chose oaks of Bashan (&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496; as well as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29</a> from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, to row), and the rowing benches (or deck) were of ivory inlaid in box. &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15</a>. for the boards or planks of the wooden walls of the tabernacle; here it is employed in a collective sense, either for the rowing benches, of which there were at least two, and sometimes three rows in a vessel, one above another, or more properly, for the deck of the vessel (Hitzig). This was made of she4n, or ivory, inlaid in wood. The ivory is mentioned first as the most valuable material of the &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, the object being to picture the ship as possessing all possible splendour. The expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, occasions some difficulty, partly on account of the use of the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, and partly in connection with the meaning of  &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; , although so much may be inferred from the context, that the allusion is to some kind of wood inlaid with ivory, and the custom of inlaying wood with ivory for the purpose of decoration is attested by Virgil, Aen. x. 137:<p>"Vel quale per artem<p>Inclusum buxo, aut Oricia terebintho<p>Lucet ebur."<p>But the use of &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; does not harmonize with the relation of the wood to the ivory inserted in wood; nor can it be defended by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-3.htm">Lamentations 3:3</a> an arrow is designated "the son of the quiver." According to this analogy, the ivory ought to have been called the son of the Ashurim, because the ivory is inserted in the wood, and not the wood in the ivory.<p>(Note: The Targum has paraphrased it in this way: &#1491;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1491;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;, i.e., planks of box or pine inlaid with ivory.)<p>continued...</body></html>
