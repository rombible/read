Haran, important in the story of Abraham (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/genesis/11-31.htm" title="And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and they came to Haran, and dwelled there.">Genesis 11:31-32</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/12-4.htm" title="So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken to him; and Lot went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when he departed out of Haran.">Genesis 12:4</a>), the Charræ of the Romans, was in north-western Mesopotamia, at the junction of two great caravan routes, the one along the Tigris, the other along the Euphrates. Canneh, a contraction for the Calneh of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>, was the most important commercial city on the former, and was later known as Ctesiphon.

They were, therefore, traders between Mesopotamia and Phœnicia. Asshur is here not the country of Assyria, but the commercial city Sura (modern Essurieh), on the banks of the Euphrates, above Thapsacus. Chilmad is supposed to be the Charmande of Xenophon (<span class= "ital">Anab.,</span> i. 5, 10), “a great city beyond the Euphrates, in the neighbourhood of the desert.” Others identify it with Kalwada, near Bagdad.

Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Haran - Charrae in Mesopotamia.<p>Canneh - "Calneh" <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>, probably Ctesiphon on the Tigris.<p>Eden - On the Euphrates <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a>.

Haran was a city of Mesopotamia, the same with Haran, where Abraham dwelt awhile, <a href="http://biblehub.com/acts/7-2.htm">Acts 7:2</a>, the Charrae of the Parthians, famous for the defeat of Crassus. Canneh is thought to be the same with Calneh, <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a>, afterwards called Ctesiphon; and here, by the Targum, Netzibin, a place not far from Tigris; and Eden also was between Tigris and Euphrates.

Harran in Mesopotamia, two days’ journey S.E. of Edessa, on a branch of the Euphrates, was a sacred city and place of pilgrimage, and also an emporium of trade. The defeat of Crassus by the Parthians took place there. Canneh may be Calneh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm" title="And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.">Genesis 10:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm" title="Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your border?">Amos 6:2</a>), otherwise Calno (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm" title="Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not Samaria as Damascus?">Isaiah 10:9</a>), a city in Babylonia. Its site has not been identified. Von Gutschmidt (<span class="ital">Ency. Brit</span>., art. Phœnicia) identifies Canneh with Cænæ. Eden, spelled somewhat differently from the Eden of Paradise, is elsewhere named in connexion with Haran, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Telassar?">Isaiah 37:12</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm" title="Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers have destroyed; as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the children of Eden which were in Thelasar?">2 Kings 19:12</a>), and said to be in Telassar (Tel Asshur).<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the merchants of Sheba</span>] It is strange that these should be mentioned again (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-22.htm" title="The merchants of Sheba and Raamah, they were your merchants: they occupied in your fairs with chief of all spices, and with all precious stones, and gold.">Ezekiel 27:22</a></span>). For “Eden … Sheba” LXX. reads: <span class="ital">these were thy merchants</span>, i.e. Haran and Canneh.

Haran (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/11-31.htm">Genesis 11:31</a>) stands for the Carrhae of the Romans, situated at the point where the old military and commercial roads bifurcated Cowards Babylon and the Delta of the Persian Gulf in the one direction, and Canaan in the other. It appears in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/24-10.htm">Genesis 24:10</a> and Genesis 29:4 as the city of Nahor, in Mesopotamia (Aram-Naharaim, equivalent to "Syria of the two rivers"), or, more definitely, in Parian-Atom, which lies below Mount Masius, between the Khabour and the Euphrates. It is famous in Roman history for the defeat of Crassus by the Parthians. <span class="cmt_word">Caaneh</span>. The eastern of the two roads just mentioned ran on to Calneh (of which Cauneh is a variant), named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/10-10.htm">Genesis 10:10</a> as one of the cities built by Nimrod. It is probably represented by the modern <span class="accented">Niffer</span>, about sixty miles southeast of Babylon. It is named in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-9.htm">Isaiah 10:9</a> in connection with Carehemish, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-2.htm">Amos 6:2</a> with Hamath the great, as conquered by the Assyrians. It has been conjecturally identified by the Targum and other ancient writers with Ctesiphon, but (?). <span class="cmt_word">Eden</span>; spelt differently in the Hebrew from the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>. It is probably identical with the Eden near Thelassar (<span class="accented">Td</span>. <span class="accented">Assar</span>) of <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/37-12.htm">Isaiah 37:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/19-12.htm">2 Kings 19:12</a>, where, as here, it is connected with Haran as among the Assyrian conquests. Its site has not been determined, and it has been placed by some geographers in the hill-country above the Upper Mesopetamian plains; by others near the confluence of the Tigris and Euphrates. The position of the Eden of <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-5.htm">Amos 1:5</a>, near Damascus, points to a Syrian town of the same name. <span class="cmt_word">The merchants of Sheba.</span> The recurrence of the name after the full mention of the people in Ver. 22 arises probably from the fact that they were the carriers in the commerce between the Mesopotamian cities just named and Tyre. <span class="cmt_word">Asshur</span>. The name may stand (Smend), as it commonly does, for Assyria as a country; but its juxtaposition with the names of cities has led some geographers (Movers, p. 252, in Keil) to identify with a city Sum (<span class="accented">Essurieh</span>) on the west bank of the Euphrates, above Thapsacus (the <span class="accented">Tiphsah</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/4-24.htm">1 Kings 4:24</a>), and on the caravan-route which runs from Palmyra (the <span class="accented">Tadmor</span> of <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/8-4.htm">2 Chronicles 8:4</a>) to Haran. <span class="cmt_word">Chilmad</span>. The name is not found elsewhere. The LXX. gives Charman, a town near the Euphrates, mentioned in Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 1:5. 10, as Charmaude. It can scarcely have been a place of much general note, but may have had some special reputation which made it prominent in Tyrian commerce. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/27.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The lamentation commences with a picture of the glory of the city of Tyre, its situation, its architectural beauty, its military strength and defences (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3-11</a>), and its wide-spread commercial relations (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-12.htm">Ezekiel 27:12-25</a>); and then passes into mournful lamentation over the ruin of all this glory (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26-36</a>).<p>Introduction and description of the glory and might of Tyre. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-1.htm">Ezekiel 27:1</a>. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-2.htm">Ezekiel 27:2</a>. And do thou, O son of man, raise a lamentation over Tyre, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>. And say to Tyre, Thou who dwellest at the approaches of the sea, merchant of the nations to many islands, thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Tyre, thou sayest, I am perfect in beauty. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a>. In the heart of the seas is thy territory; thy builders have made thy beauty perfect. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-5.htm">Ezekiel 27:5</a>. Out of cypresses of Senir they built all double-plank-work for thee; they took cedars of Lebanon to make a mast upon thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-6.htm">Ezekiel 27:6</a>. They made thine oars of oaks of Bashan, thy benches they made of ivory set in box from the islands of the Chittaeans. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-7.htm">Ezekiel 27:7</a>. Byssus in embroidery from Egypt was thy sail, to serve thee for a banner; blue and red purple from the islands of Elishah was thine awning. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>. The inhabitants of Sidon and Arvad were thy rowers; thy skilful men, O Tyre, were in thee, they were thy sailors. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-9.htm">Ezekiel 27:9</a>. The elders of Gebal and its skilful men were with thee to repair thy leaks; all the ships of the sea and their mariners were in thee to barter thy goods. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-10.htm">Ezekiel 27:10</a>. Persian and Lydian and Libyan were in thine army, thy men of war; shield and helmet they hung up in thee; they gave brilliancy to thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-11.htm">Ezekiel 27:11</a>. The sons of Arvad and thine army were upon thy walls round about, and brave men were upon they towers; they hung up their shields upon thy walls round about; they have made thy beauty perfect. - The lamentation commences with an address to Tyre, in which its favourable situation for purposes of trade, and the perfect beauty of which she was conscious, are placed in the foreground (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-3.htm">Ezekiel 27:3</a>). Tyre is sitting, or dwelling, at the approaches of the sea. &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;&#1514; &#1497;&#1501;, approaches or entrances of the sea, are harbours into which ships sail and from which they depart, just as &#1502;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1492;&#1506;&#1497;&#1512; sa t, the gate of the city, it both entrance and exit. This description does not point to the city on the mainland, or Old Tyre, but answers exactly to Insular Tyre with its two harbours.<p>(Note: Insular Tyre possessed two harbours, a northern one called the Sidonian, because it was on the Sidonian side, and one on the opposite or south-eastern side, which was called the Egyptian harbour from the direction in which it pointed. The Sidonian was the more celebrated of the two, and consisted of an inner harbour, situated within the wall of the city, and an outer one, formed by a row of rocks, which lay at a distance of about three hundred paces to the north-west of the island, and ran parallel to the opposite coast of the mainland, so as to form a roadstead in which ships could anchor (vid., Arrian, ii. 20; Strabo, xvi. 2. 23). This northern harbour is still held by the city of Sur, whereas the Egyptian harbour with the south-eastern portion of the island has been buried by the sand driven against the coasts by the south winds, so that even the writers of the Middle Ages make no allusion to it. (See Movers, Phnizier, II. 1, pp. 214ff.).)<p>&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1497;, with the connecting i, which is apparently confounded here after the Aramaean fashion with the i of the feminine pronoun, and has therefore been marked by the Masora as superfluous (vid., Ewald, 211b). The combination of &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1514; with '&#1488;&#1500; &#1488;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512; may be accounted for from the primary meaning of &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;, to travel about as a merchant: thou who didst go to the nations on many shores to carry on thy trade. Tyre itself considers that she is perfect in her beauty, partly on account of her strong position in the sea, and partly because of her splendid edifices.<p>(Note: Curtius, iv. 2: Tyrus et claritate et magnitudine ante omnes urbes Syriae Phoenicesque memorabilis. (Cf. Strabo, xvi. 2.22.))<p>In the description which follows of this beauty and glory, from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a> onwards, Tyre is depicted allegorically as a beautiful ship, splendidly built and equipped throughout, and its destruction is afterwards represented as a shipwreck occasioned by the east wind (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-26.htm">Ezekiel 27:26</a>.).<p>(Note: Jerome recognised this allegory, and has explained it correctly as follows: "He (the prophet) speaks &#x3c4;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c0;&#x3b9;&#x3ba;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;, as though addressing a ship, and points out its beauty and the abundance of everything. Then, after having depicted all its supplies, he announces that a storm will rise, and the south wind (auster) will blow, by which great waves will be gathered up, and the vessel will be wrecked. In all this he is referring to the overthrow of the city by King Nabuchodonosor," etc. Rashi and others give the same explanation.)<p>The words, "in the heart of the seas is thy territory" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-4.htm">Ezekiel 27:4</a>), are equally applicable to the city of Tyre and to a ship, the building of which is described in what follows. The comparison of Tyre to a ship was very naturally suggested by the situation of the city in the midst of the sea, completely surrounded by water. As a ship, it must of necessity be built of wood. The shipbuilders selected the finest kinds of wood for the purpose; cypresses of Antilibanus for double planks, which formed the sides of the vessel, and cedar of Lebanon for the mast. Senir, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>, was the Amoritish name of Hermon or Antilibanus, whereas the Sidonians called it Sirion. On the other hand, Senir occurs in <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/5-23.htm">1 Chronicles 5:23</a>, and Shenir in Sol 4:8, in connection with Hermon, where they are used to denote separate portions of Antilibanus. Ezekiel evidently uses Senir as a foreign name, which had been retained to his own time, whereas Sirion had possibly become obsolete, as the names had both the same meaning (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-9.htm">Deuteronomy 3:9</a>). The naming of the places from which the several materials were obtained for the fitting out of the ship, serve to heighten the glory of its construction and give an ideal character to the picture. All lands have contributed their productions to complete the glory and might of Tyre. Cypress-wood was frequently used by the ancients for buildings and (according to Virgil, Georg. ii. 443) also for ships, because it was exempt from the attacks of worms, and was almost imperishable, and yet very light (Theophr. Hist. plant. v. 8; Plinii Hist. nat. xvi. 79). &#1500;&#1495;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, a dual form, like &#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-4.htm">2 Kings 25:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-11.htm">Isaiah 22:11</a>, double-planks, used for the two side-walls of the ship. For oars they chose oaks of Bashan (&#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496; as well as &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1496; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-29.htm">Ezekiel 27:29</a> from &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1496;, to row), and the rowing benches (or deck) were of ivory inlaid in box. &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/26-15.htm">Exodus 26:15</a>. for the boards or planks of the wooden walls of the tabernacle; here it is employed in a collective sense, either for the rowing benches, of which there were at least two, and sometimes three rows in a vessel, one above another, or more properly, for the deck of the vessel (Hitzig). This was made of she4n, or ivory, inlaid in wood. The ivory is mentioned first as the most valuable material of the &#1511;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473;, the object being to picture the ship as possessing all possible splendour. The expression &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1470;&#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, occasions some difficulty, partly on account of the use of the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;, and partly in connection with the meaning of  &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; , although so much may be inferred from the context, that the allusion is to some kind of wood inlaid with ivory, and the custom of inlaying wood with ivory for the purpose of decoration is attested by Virgil, Aen. x. 137:<p>"Vel quale per artem<p>Inclusum buxo, aut Oricia terebintho<p>Lucet ebur."<p>But the use of &#1489;&#1468;&#1514; does not harmonize with the relation of the wood to the ivory inserted in wood; nor can it be defended by the fact that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/lamentations/3-3.htm">Lamentations 3:3</a> an arrow is designated "the son of the quiver." According to this analogy, the ivory ought to have been called the son of the Ashurim, because the ivory is inserted in the wood, and not the wood in the ivory.<p>(Note: The Targum has paraphrased it in this way: &#1491;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1503; &#1491;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1503; &#1502;&#1499;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1503; &#1489;&#1513;&#1473;&#1503; &#1491;&#1508;&#1497;&#1500;, i.e., planks of box or pine inlaid with ivory.)<p>continued...</body></html>
