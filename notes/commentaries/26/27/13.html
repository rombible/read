Let none reckon themselves beautified, any further than they are sanctified. The account of the trade of Tyre intimates, that God's eye is upon men when employed in worldly business. Not only when at church, praying and hearing, but when in markets and fairs, buying and selling. In all our dealings we should keep a conscience void of offence. God, as the common Father of mankind, makes one country abound in one commodity, and another in another, serviceable to the necessity or to the comfort and ornament of human life. See what a blessing trade and merchandise are to mankind, when followed in the fear of God. Besides necessaries, an abundance of things are made valuable only by custom; yet God allows us to use them. But when riches increase, men are apt to set their hearts upon them, and forget the Lord, who gives power to get wealth.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/27.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Jaran - Greece (Ion), including the Grecian colonies in Sicily and Italy.<p>Tubal, and Meshech - The Tibareni and Moschi, whose lands were on the Caucasian highlands between the Euxine and Caspian Seas (see the marginal reference), were a fine race of men; from thence slaves have been continually sought.

The first is the Ionians, the Greeks of Asia Minor, and the two last have usually been identified with the Moschi and Tibareni, lying to the S. and S.E. of the Black Sea. Copper and “souls of men” i.e. slaves, form the contribution of these countries. That Javan traded in slaves appears from Joel 4:6; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-9.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered not the brotherly covenant:">Amos 1:9</a>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">they traded … in thy market</span>] <span class="bld">they brought as thy wares souls of men</span>, &c.

In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a> they are associated with Elam and Asshur (Assyria); in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-2.htm">Ezekiel 38:2, 3</a> and Ezekiel 39:1 with Gog. The two names probably represented the tribes on the southeast coast of the Black Sea. Here the chief traffic was in slaves, the Tyrian traders probably buying them in exchange for their manufactured goods, and selling them to the cities of Greece as well as Phoenicia. In Greek history the names appear as Tibaroni and Moschi (Herod., 3:94; Xenophon, 'Anab.,' 5:5. 2, <span class="accented">etal</span>.). In Joel 4:6 Tyriaus are represented as selling Israelites as slaves in Greek cities (Hebrew "sons of Javan"). Thrace and Scythia were at all times the chief countries from which Greece imported her slaves. <span class="cmt_word">Vessels of brass.</span> Here, as throughout the Old Testament, we should read "copper," the mixed metal which we know as "brass" not Being known to ancient metallurgy. Copper-mines were found near the Caucasus, and Euboea was also famous for them.

For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, When I make thee a desolate city, like the cities which are no longer inhabited, when I cause the deep to rise over thee, so that the many waters cover thee, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-20.htm">Ezekiel 26:20</a>. I cast thee down to those who have gone into the grave, to the people of olden time, and cause thee to dwell in the land of the lower regions, in the ruins from the olden time, with those who have gone into the grave, that thou mayest be no longer inhabited, and I create that which is glorious in the land of the living. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>. I make thee a terror, and thou art no more; they will seek thee, and find thee no more for ever, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - Not only will ruin and desolation come upon Tyre, but it will sink for ever into the region of the dead. In this concluding thought the whole threat is summed up. The infinitive clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a> recapitulate the leading thoughts of the previous strophes, for the purpose of appending the closing thought of banishment to the under-world. By the rising of the deep we are to understand, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-12.htm">Ezekiel 26:12</a>, that the city in its ruins will be sunk into the depths of the sea. &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; , those who go down into the pit or grave, are the dead. They are described still further as &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;, not "those who are sleeping the long sleep of death," or the generation of old whom all must join; but the people of the "old world" before the flood (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_peter/2-5.htm">2 Peter 2:5</a>), who were buried by the waters of the flood, in accordance with <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/22-15.htm">Job 22:15</a>, where &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; denotes the generations of the primeval world, and after the analogy of the use of &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/44-7.htm">Isaiah 44:7</a>, to describe the human race as existing from time immemorial.<p>In harmony with this, &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;  are the ruins of the primeval world which perished in the flood. As &#1506;&#1501; &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; adds emphasis to the idea of &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; &#1489;&#1493;&#1512;, so also does &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; &#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501; to that of &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;. Tyre shall not only descend to the dead in Sheol, but be thrust down to the people of the dead, who were sunk into the depths of the earth by the waters of the flood, and shall there receive its everlasting dwelling-place among the ruins of the primeval world which was destroyed by the flood, beside that godless race of the olden time. &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514;, land of the lowest places (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>), is a periphrasis for Sheol, the region of the dead (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ephesians/4-9.htm">Ephesians 4:9</a>, "the lower parts of the earth"). On '&#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1510;&#1489;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; Hitzig has observed with perfect correctness: "If we retain the pointing as the first person, with which the place assigned to the Athnach (-) coincides, we must at any rate not regard the clause as still dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, and the force of the &#1500;&#1488; as continued. We should then have to take the clause as independent and affirmative, as the accentuators and the Targum have done." But as this would give rise to a discrepancy between the two halves of the verse, Hitzig proposes to alter &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; retla ot seso into the second person &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;, so that the clause would still be governed by &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; &#1500;&#1488;. But the want of agreement between the two halves of the verse does not warrant an alteration of the text, especially if it lead to nothing better than the forced rendering adopted by Hitzig, "and thou no longer shinest with glory in the land of the living," which there is nothing in the language to justify. And even the explanation proposed by Hvernick and Kliefoth, "that I no longer produce anything glorious from thee (Tyre) in the land of the living," is open to this objection, that "from thee" is arbitrarily interpolated into the text; and if this were what Ezekiel meant, he would either have added &#1500;&#1498; or written &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;. Moreover, the change of the person is a sufficient objection to our taking &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; as dependent upon &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503;, and supplying &#1500;&#1488;. &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is evidently a simple continuation of &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498;. And nothing but the weightiest objections should lead us to give up a view which so naturally suggests itself. But no such objections exist. Neither the want of harmony between the two halves of the verse, nor the context, - according to which Tyre and its destruction are referred to both before and immediately after, - forces us to the adoption of explanations at variance with the simple meaning of the words. We therefore adhere to the natural interpretation of the words, "and I set (establish) glory in the land of the living;" and understand by the land of the living, not the theocracy especially, but the earth, in contrast to the region of the dead. The words contain the general thought, that on and after the overthrow of the glory of the ungodly power of the world, He will create that which is glorious on the earth to endure for ever; and this He really does by the establishing of His kingdom. - Tyre, on the contrary, shall become, through its fate, an object of terror, or an example of sudden destruction, and pass away with all its glory, not leaving a trace behind. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-21.htm">Ezekiel 26:21</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/41-12.htm">Isaiah 41:12</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/37-36.htm">Psalm 37:36</a>. &#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;, imperf. Pual, has Chateph-patach between the two u, to indicate emphatically that the syllable is only a very loosely closed one (vid., Ewald, 31b, p. 95). </body></html>
