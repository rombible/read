He compares her to a ship, impelled by its own rowers into a very tempestuous sea, by which is meant their war with the Chaldeans. See a similar comparison <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/33-23.htm" title="Your tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.">Isaiah 33:23</a>. Great troubles are frequently signified by great waters. <span class="ital">The east wind hath broken thee — </span>By this is signified the Chaldean army coming from the east: as if he had said, As the violence of the east wind occasions many shipwrecks in the sea, so the army of thy enemies, coming upon thee, shall ruin thy strength and glory, and leave thee like a wreck cast upon the shore. “This is a proper allegory,” says Bishop Warburton, “with only one real sense; and it is managed by the prophet with that brevity and expedition which a proper allegory demands, when used in the place of a metaphor.” Grotius refers to Horace, lib. 1. ode 14, as an allegory very similar to this of the prophet.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:26-36 The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and states, sooner or later, come down.

Here the city of Tyre is compared to a vessel at sea, with great propriety, it being built in the sea, and its trade chiefly there; and its rulers and governors, or the inhabitants of it, to rowers; literally the men of Zidon and Arvad were her rowers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-8.htm">Ezekiel 27:8</a>, the straits, difficulties, and distresses these brought Tyre into, are compared to great waters; who, by some unadvised step or another, provoked the king of Babylon to come against them with his army, and lay siege unto them: <p>the east wind hath broken thee in the midst of the seas; a wind very fatal to ships and mariners; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>, by it are meant Nebuchadnezzar and the Chaldean army; so called, because of their great force and fury; and because Babylon, from whence they came, lay somewhat to the east of Tyre.

The allegory does not need interpretation. How far her statesmen precipitated the fall of Tyre is unknown; it was the east-wind that broke her in the heart of the sea—a force above that of men (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm" title="You break the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.">Psalm 48:7</a>).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/27.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 26.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy rowers have brought thee</span>. The metaphor goes on its course. The state-ship is in the open sea, and the east wind, the Euroclydon of the Mediterranean (<a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/27-14.htm">Acts 27:14</a>), blows and threatens it with destruction (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/48-7.htm">Psalm 48:7</a>). In that destruction all who contributed to her prosperity were involved. The picture reminds us of the description of the ship of Tarshish in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jonah/1-4.htm">Jonah 1:4, 5</a>. The city shall be left, in that terrible day<span class="cmt_word">, in the heart of the seas</span> (Revised Version). </body></html>
