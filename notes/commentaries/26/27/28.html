There was no land around Tyre, and it is here used, therefore, in a general sense—all thy surroundings.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/27.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>27:26-36 The most mighty and magnificent kingdoms and states, sooner or later, come down. Those who make creatures their confidence, and rest their hopes upon them, will fall with them: happy are those who have the God of Jacob for their Help, and whose hope is in the Lord their God, who lives for ever. Those who engage in trade should learn to conduct their business according to God's word. Those who possess wealth should remember they are the Lord's stewards, and should use his goods in doing good to all.

Or, the waves, an elegant hyperbole, thus read; The very waves, which roar and terrify, shall hear and tremble at a stranger and more doleful cry than their own. Or, as our version, The suburbs, which are nearest the sea, shall first hear the outcries of pilots and mariners despairing of escape, when, their ship broken to pieces, all at once shriek out. So shall thy citizens cry and fall. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/27.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>The suburbs shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots. Or governors, as the Targum; and so the Vulgate Latin, and all the Oriental versions: the allegory of a ship wrecked is still continued: the sense is, that such should be the cry of the principal men of the city when it should be taken, that the noise of it would be heard upon the continent, and in the towns and villages belonging to Tyre, which would make the inhabitants of them tremble: or, <p>at the sound of the cry of thy pilots the waves are moved, or "tremble" (g); which beat very strong at the time of her fall into the sea. <p>(g)  "commoti sunt fluctus jactni", Junius &amp; Tremellius; "contremiscent fluctus", Piscator. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/27.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> common lands shall shake at the sound of the cry of thy pilots.</span><p>(m) That is, the cities near you, as Zidon, Arund and others.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/27.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">28</span>. <span class="ital">the suburbs</span>] According to tradition (Baer, <span class="ital">Ezek</span>.) the term here is differently pointed from that rendered “suburbs,” e.g. ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/45-2.htm" title="Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.">Ezekiel 45:2</a>. The latter term means the free space surrounding a city or building. If the sense of the present word were the same reference would be to the lands or coasts in the vicinity of Tyre, a sense far from natural. Jerome conjectured “fleets” (Ew.). In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/57-20.htm" title="But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt.">Isaiah 57:20</a> the verb describes the violent action of the waters of the sea (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/8-8.htm" title="Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwells therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.">Amos 8:8</a>), and A.

Here it is probably used in a wider sense for the  coast-lands of Phoenicia, or even (as in the margin) for the "waves" that washed the shores of the island-city.
