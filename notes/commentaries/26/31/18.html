And he shall resemble him in his fall. His own sin brings his ruin. None of our comforts are ever lost, but what have been a thousand times forfeited. When great men fall, many fall with them, as many have fallen before them. The fall of proud men is for warning to others, to keep them humble. See how low Pharaoh lies; and see what all his pomp and pride are come to. It is best to be a lowly tree of righteousness, yielding fruit to the glory of God, and to the good of men. The wicked man is often seen flourishing like the cedar, and spreading like the green bay tree, but he soon passes away, and his place is no more found.

Application of the parabolic description of Assyria to the parallel case of Egypt. "All that has been said of the Assyrian consider as said to thyself. To whom art thou so like, as thou art to the Assyrian? To none." The lesson on a gigantic scale of Eden-like privileges abused to pride and sin by the Assyrian, as in the case of the first man in Eden, ending in ruin, was to be repeated in Egypt's case. For the unchangeable God governs the world on the same unchangeable principles.<p>thou shall lie in &#8230; uncircumcised&#8212;As circumcision was an object of mocking to thee, thou shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised, slain by their sword [Grotius]. Retribution in kind (Eze 28:10).<p>This is Pharaoh&#8212;Pharaoh's end shall be the same humiliating one as I have depicted the Assyrian's to have been.

Among all the kings and potentates of the earth; pitch on whom you will, say which of them all, even the greatest of them for majesty and glory, for wealth and riches, power and authority, and extent of dominion, you are equal to; name the king of Assyria, if you please, before described, though you are not equal to him; and if you were, this would not secure you from ruin; since, as great as he was, he fell, and so will you: this is said to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and is an application of the preceding parable to him; suggesting, that let him be as high as any ever was, or he could imagine himself to be: <p>yet shall thou be brought down with the trees of Eden unto the nether parts of the earth; the grave, and lie in the same depressed and humble state as the greatest monarchs that ever were on earth do: <p>thou shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised; the wicked, as the Targum; the uncircumcised in heart; who belong not to God, or his people, and have no communion with either, but are shut out of the kingdom of heaven, and have their portion with devils and damned spirits: <p>with them that be slain by the sword; in a way of judgment for their sins: <p>this is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God; this account represents Pharaoh, his grandeur, his pride, and his ruin; this shows what will be the end of him, and of his numerous subjects. The Septuagint and Arabic versions render it, "so will be Pharaoh", &amp;c. in like manner will he fall, and all his people with him; for the Lord God has said it, and it shall assuredly come to pass. The Targum is, <p>"to whom art thou like now in glory and greatness among the kings of the east? and thou shall be brought down with the kings of the east into the lower part of the earth; in the midst of sinners thou shalt sleep, with those that are slain by the sword; this is Pharaoh, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/31.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">To whom <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> art thou thus like in glory and in greatness among the trees of Eden? yet shalt thou be brought down with the trees of Eden to the lower parts of the earth: thou shalt lie in the midst of the <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> uncircumcised with <i>them that are</i> slain by the sword.

The question implies that Pharaoh had no peers. Yet though incomparably greater than the other trees his fate shall be the same as theirs—he shall be brought down with them to the nether parts of the earth.

For '&#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1490;&#1491;&#1468;&#1500; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm">Ezekiel 29:10</a>.

The fire which God will bring into Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-8.htm">Ezekiel 30:8</a>) is the fire of war. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm">Ezekiel 30:9</a>. The tidings of this judgment of God will be carried by messengers to Ethiopia, and there awaken the most terrible dread of a similar fate. In the first hemistich, the prophet has <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/18-2.htm">Isaiah 18:2</a> floating before his mind. The messengers, who carry the tidings thither, are not the warlike forces of Chaldea, who are sent thither by God; for they would not be content with performing the service of messengers alone. We have rather to think of Egyptians, who flee by ship to Ethiopia. The messengers go, &#1502;&#1500;&#1508;&#1504;&#1497;, from before Jehovah, who is regarded as being present in Egypt, while executing judgment there (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-1.htm">Isaiah 19:1</a>). &#1510;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-24.htm">Numbers 24:24</a>  equals  &#1510;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/11-30.htm">Daniel 11:30</a>), ships, trieres, according to the Rabbins, in Hieron.

'&#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;, as in the day of Egypt, i.e., not the present day of Egypt's punishment, for the Ethiopians have only just heard of this from the messengers; but the ancient, well-known day of judgment upon Egypt (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/15-12.htm">Exodus 15:12</a>.). Ewald and Hitzig follow the lxx in taking &#1499;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; for &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501;; but this is both incorrect and unsuitable, and reduces '&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512; into a tame repetition of &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1495;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;. The subject to &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1488;&#1492; is to be taken from the context, viz., that which is predicted in the preceding verses (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6-8</a>). </body></html>
