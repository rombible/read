The “wastes” are the desolate cities; those that still hover about these ruins shall be slain by the enemy.

The words paint, with a terrible vividness, what was passing in Ezekiel's fatherland. Did the fugitives of Judah seek the open country? they were exposed to the sword of the Chaldeans or of marauding outlaws. Did they seek safety in fortresses or caves? they were exposed, crowded together as they were under the worst possible conditions, to the ravages of pestilence. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Second strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>. There is Asshur and all its multitude, round about it their graves, all of them slain, fallen by the sword <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a>. Whose graves are made in the deepest pit, and its multitude is round about its grave; all slain, fallen by the sword, who spread terror in the land of the living. - The enumeration commences with Asshur, the world-power, which had already been overthrown by the Chaldeans. It is important to notice here, that &#1488;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, like &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>, is construed as a feminine, as &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; which follows in every case plainly shows. It is obvious, therefore, that the predominant idea is not that of the king or people, but that of the kingdom or world-power. It is true that in the suffixes attached to &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; &#1511;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>, and &#1505;&#1489;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>, the masculine alternates with the feminine, and Hitzig therefore proposes to erase these words; but the alternation may be very simply explained, on the ground that the ideas of the kingdom and its king are not kept strictly separate, but that the words oscillate from one idea to the other. It is affirmed of Asshur, that as a world-power it lies in Sheol, and the gravers of its countrymen are round about the graves of its ruler. They all lie there as those who have fallen by the sword, i.e., who have been swept away by a judgment of God. To this is added in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-23.htm">Ezekiel 32:23</a> the declaration that the graves of Asshur lie in the utmost sides, i.e., the utmost or deepest extremity of Sheol; whereas so long as this power together with its people was in the land of the living, i.e., so long as they ruled on earth, they spread terror all around them by their violent deeds. From the loftiest height of earthly might and greatness, they are hurled down to the lowest hell. The higher on earth, the deeper in the nether world. Hvernick has entirely misunderstood the words "round about Asshur are its graves" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>), and "its multitude is round about its grave" (the grave of this world-power), when he finds therein the thought that the graves and corpses are to be regarded as separated, so that the dead are waiting near their graves in deepest sorrow, looking for the honour of burial, but looking in vain. There is not a word of this in the text, but simply that the graves of the people lie round about the grave of their ruler.</body></html>
