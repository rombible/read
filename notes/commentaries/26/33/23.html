None of the prophecies from this point to the close of Ezekiel 39 are dated. Ezekiel 40-48 form one continuous prophecy, which closes the book, and is dated more than twelve years after the present one. We are then to suppose that the prophecies, to Ezekiel 39 inclusive, were uttered at intervals during these twelve years, but we have no means of fixing their dates more exactly.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>33:21-29 Those are unteachable indeed, who do not learn their dependence upon God, when all creature-comforts fail.

The confirmation by the fugitives of all his previous predictions gave the prophet boldness to speak anew, and what he says is but a continuation of that which he had said before, and had been so literally confirmed. He had predicted the city’s fall because of its sins, and his prophecy had been verified; those remaining in the land continue in the sins for which the city fell, and its fate shall certainly overtake them.

Son of man, lament over the tumult of Egypt, and hurl it down, her, like the daughters of glorious nations, into the nether world, to those who go into the pit! <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19</a>. Whom dost thou surpass in loveliness? Go down and lay thyself with the uncircumcised. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a>. Among those slain with the sword will they fall; the sword is handed, draw her down and all her tumult. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-21.htm">Ezekiel 32:21</a>. The strong ones of the heroes say of it out of the midst of hell with its helpers: they are gone down, they lie there, the uncircumcised, slain with the sword. -  &#1504;&#1492;&#1492;, utter a lamentation, and &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, thrust it (the tumult of Egypt) down, are co-ordinate. With the lamentation, or by means thereof, is Ezekiel to thrust down the tumult of Egypt into hell. The lamentation is God's word; and as such it has the power to accomplish what it utters. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; is not intended as a repetition of the suffix &#1470;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;, but resumes the principal idea contained in the object already named, viz., &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, Egypt, i.e., its population. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1492;&#1468; and the daughters of glorious nations are co-ordinate. &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;, as in the expression, daughter of Tyre, daughter Babel, denotes the population of powerful heathen nations. The &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1501; can only be the nations enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>., which, according to these verses, are already in Sheol, not about to be thrust down, but thrust down already. Consequently the copula &#1493; before &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514; is to be taken in the sense of a comparison, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/12-15.htm">1 Samuel 12:15</a> (cf. Ewald, 340b). All these glorious nations have also been hurled down by the word of God; and Egypt is to be associated with them. By thus placing Egypt on a level with all the fallen nations, the enumeration of which fills the middle strophes of the ode, the lamentation over Egypt is extended into a funeral-dirge on the fall of all the heathen powers of the world. For &#1488;&#1512;&#1509; &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1497;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497; , compare Ezekiel 276:20. The ode itself commences in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-19.htm">Ezekiel 32:19</a>, by giving prominence to the glory of the falling kingdom. But this prominence consists in the brief inquiry &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1497; &#1504;&#1506;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;, before whom art thou lovely? i.e., art thou more lovely than any one else? The words are addressed either to &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-18.htm">Ezekiel 32:18</a>), or what is more probable, to Pharaoh with all his tumult (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-32.htm">Ezekiel 32:32</a>), i.e., to the world-power, Egypt, as embodied in the person of Pharaoh; and the meaning of the question is the following: - Thou, Egypt, art indeed lovely; but thou art not better or more lovely than other mighty heathen nations; therefore thou canst not expect any better fate than to go down into Sheol, and there lie with the uncircumcised. &#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>. This is carried out still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-20.htm">Ezekiel 32:20</a>, and the ground thereof assigned. The subject to &#1497;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; is the Egyptians, or Pharaoh and his tumult. They fall in the midst of those pierced with the sword. The sword is already handed to the executor of the judgment, the king of Babel (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>). Their destruction is so certain, that the words are addressed to the bearers of the sword: "Draw Egypt and all its tumult down into Sheol" (&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; is imperative for &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/12-21.htm">Exodus 12:21</a>), and, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-21.htm">Ezekiel 32:21</a>, the heathen already in Sheol are speaking of his destruction. &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1493; is rendered by many, "there speak to him, address him, greet him," with an allusion to <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9</a>., where the king of Babel, when descending into Sheol, is greeted with malicious pleasure by the kings already there. But however obvious the fact may be that Ezekiel has this passage in mind, there is no address in the verse before us as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-10.htm">Isaiah 14:10</a>, but simply a statement concerning the Egyptians, made in the third person. Moreover, &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; could hardly be made to harmonize with &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468; &#1500;&#1493;, if &#1500;&#1493; signified ad eum. For it is not allowable to connect &#1506;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; (taken in the sense of along with their helpers) with &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as a noun in apposition, for the simple reason that the two are separated by &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498; &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;. Consequently &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493; can only belong to &#1497;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;: they talk (of him) with his helpers. &#1506;&#1494;&#1512;&#1497;&#1493;, his (Pharaoh's) helpers are his allies, who have already gone down before him into hell (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-8.htm">Ezekiel 30:8</a>). The singular suffix, which has offended Hitzig, is quite in order as corresponding to &#1500;&#1493;. The words, "they have gone down, lie there," etc., point once more to the fact that the same fate has happened to the Egyptians as to all the rest of the rulers and nations of the world whom God has judged. For &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; &#1490;&#1489;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, strong ones of the heroes, compare the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-11.htm">Ezekiel 31:11</a>. &#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1493;&#1500;, hell  equals  the nether world, the gathering-place of the dead; not the place of punishment for the damned. &#1495;&#1500;&#1500;&#1497; without the article is a predicate, and not in apposition to &#1492;&#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;. On the application of this epithet to the Egyptians, Kliefoth has correctly observed that "the question whether the Egyptians received circumcision is one that has no bearing upon this passage; for in the sense in which Ezekiel understands circumcision, the Egyptians were uncircumcised, even if they were accustomed to circumcise their flesh."<p>In the four following strophes (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22-30</a>) a series of heathen nations is enumerated, whom the Egyptian finds already in hell, and with whom he will share the same fate. There are six of these - namely, Asshur, Elam, Meshech-Tubal, Edom, the princes of the north, and Sidon. The six are divisible into two classes - three great and remote world-powers, and three smaller neighbouring nations. In this no regard is paid to the time of destruction. With the empire of Asshur, which had already fallen, there are associated Elam and Meshech-Tubal, two nations, which only rose to the rank of world-powers in the more immediate and more remote future; and among the neighbouring nations, the Sidonians and princes of the north, i.e., The Syrian kings, are grouped with Edom, although the Sidonians had long ago given up their supremacy to Tyre, and the Aramean kings, who had once so grievously oppressed the kingdom of Israel, had already been swallowed up in the Assyrian and Chaldean empire. It may, indeed, be said that "in any case, at the time when Ezekiel prophesied, princes enough had already descended into Sheol both of the Assyrians and Elamites, etc., to welcome the Egyptians as soon as they came" (Kliefoth); but with the same justice may it also be said that many of the rulers and countrymen of Egypt had also descended into Sheol already, at the time when Pharaoh, reigning in Ezekiel's day, was to share the same fate. It is evident, therefore, that "any such reflection upon chronological relations is out of place in connection with our text, the intention of which is merely to furnish an exemplification" (Kliefoth), and that Ezekiel looks upon Egypt more in the light of a world-power, discerning in its fall the overthrow of all the heathen power of the world, and predicting it under the prophetic picture, that Pharaoh and his tumult are expected and welcomed by the princes and nations that have already descended into Sheol, as coming to share their fate with them.</body></html>
