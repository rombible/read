Yet these verses have also a distinct retrospective object, and explain to the people why he had hitherto spoken to them so much of judgments and in such warning tones; this had been his duty, both in obedience to God’s commands and in regard for their welfare, and it would still be his duty in the future.

His business is to warn sinners of their misery and danger. He must warn the wicked to turn from their way, that they may live. If souls perish through his neglect of duty, he brings guilt upon himself. See what those have to answer for, who make excuses for sin, flatter sinners, and encourage them to believe they shall have peace, though they go on. How much wiser are men in their temporal than in their spiritual concerns! They set watchmen to guard their houses, and sentinels to warn of the enemies' approach, but where the everlasting happiness or misery of the soul is at stake, they are offended if ministers obey their Master's command, and give a faithful warning; they would rather perish, listening to smooth things.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Again - And.

So now, in Eze 33:21, the tidings of the fact having arrived, he opens his heretofore closed lips to the Jews. In the interval he had prophesied as to foreign nations. The former part of the chapter, at Eze 33:2-20, seems to have been imparted to Ezekiel on the evening previous (Eze 33:22), being a preparation for the latter part (Eze 33:23-33) imparted after the tidings had come. This accounts for the first part standing without intimation of the date, which was properly reserved for the latter part, to which the former was the anticipatory introduction [Fairbairn].<p>watchman&#8212;Eze 33:1-9 exhibit Ezekiel's office as a spiritual watchman; so in Eze 3:16-21; only here the duties of the earthly watchman (compare 2Sa 18:24, 25; 2Ki 9:17) are detailed first, and then the application is made to the spiritual watchman's duty (compare Isa 21:6-10; Ho 9:8; Hab 2:1). "A man of their coasts" is a man specially chosen for the office out of their whole number. So Jud 18:2, "five men from their coasts"; also the Hebrew of Ge 47:2; implying the care needed in the choice of the watchman, the spiritual as well as the temporal (Ac 1:21, 22, 24-26; 1Ti 5:22).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> The prophet, after three years’ silence enjoined him now hath his mouth opened by new commission. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To the chidldren of thy people; </span> to the Jews in general, to who he had not spoken since what he spake in the 24th chapter, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Say unto them; </span> propound a parable unto then <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When; </span> if at any time. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The sword; </span> war, or any sore judgment. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Take a man; </span> choose out a man who live on the borders, and knows the avenues and the ways the enemy will most likely come to assault them.

Ezekiel falls back upon the thought of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17</a>, but the image is expanded with characteristic fullness. The function of the watchman, in which he sees a parable of his own office, is to stand upon his tower (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/18-24.htm">2 Samuel 18:24, 25</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/9-17.htm">2 Kings 9:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>), to keep his eye on the distant horizon, and as soon as the clouds of dust or the gleam of armor gives notice of the approach of the enemy, to sound the trumpet of alarm (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-6.htm">Amos 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/8-1.htm">Hosea 8:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/4-5.htm">Jeremiah 4:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a>), that men may not be taken unawares. If he discharge that duty faithfully, then, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-17.htm">Ezekiel 3:17-21</a>, the blood of those that perish through their own negligence shall rest on their own head. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/31.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Impression Made upon the Nations by the Fall of Asshur; and Its Application to Pharaoh<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-15.htm">Ezekiel 31:15</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, In the day that he went down to hell I caused a mourning: covered the flood for his sake, and stopped its streams, and the great waters were held back: I caused Lebanon to blacken itself for him, and all the trees of the field pined for him. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a>. I made the nations tremble at the noise of his fall, when I cast him down to hell to those who go into the grave: and they comforted themselves in the nether world, even all the trees of Eden, the choice and most beautiful of Lebanon, all the water-drinkers. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-17.htm">Ezekiel 31:17</a>. They also went with him into hell, to those pierced with the sword, who sat as his helpers in his shade among the nations. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a>. Whom dost thou thus resemble in glory and greatness among the trees of Eden? So shalt thou be thrust down to the trees of Eden into the nether world, and lie among uncircumcised ones with those pierced with the sword. This is Pharaoh and all his tumult, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - In order that the overthrow of the Assyrian, i.e., the destruction of the Assyrian empire, may be placed in the clearest light, a picture is drawn of the impression which it made upon the whole creation. There is no necessity to understand &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; in a past sense, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-10.htm">Ezekiel 31:10</a>. What God did on the overthrow of Asshur He may even now, for the first time, make known through the prophet, for a warning to Pharaoh and the people of Israel. That this is the way in which the words are to be interpreted, is evident from the use of the perfect &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, followed by the historical imperfects, which cannot be taken in a prophetical sense, as Kliefoth supposes, or turned into futures. It is contrary to Hebrew usage to connect &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; and &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497; together as asyndeton, so as to form one idea, viz., "to veil in mourning" as Ewald and Hvernick propose. The circumstances under which two verbs are joined together to form one idea are of a totally different kind. In this instance &#1492;&#1488;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; is placed first as an absolute; and in the sentences which follow, it is more specifically defined by a detail of the objects which were turned into mourning. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1493; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501; cannot mean her, "to cover the flood upon (over) him" (after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-7.htm">Ezekiel 24:7</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-19.htm">Ezekiel 26:19</a>); for this is altogether unsuitable to either the more remote or the more immediate context. The tree Asshur was not destroyed by a flood, but cut down by strangers. The following clauses, "I stopped its streams," etc., show very plainly that the connection between the flood (&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;) and the tree which had been felled is to be understood in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-4.htm">Ezekiel 31:4</a>. A flood, which poured its &#1504;&#1492;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514; round about its plantation, made the cedar-tree great; and now that the tree has been felled, God covers the flood on its account. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492;  is to be explained from &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1492; &#1513;&#1474;&#1511;, to veil or wrap in mourning, as Raschi, Kimchi, Vatablus, and many others have shown. The word &#1513;&#1474;&#1511; is omitted, because it appeared inappropriate to &#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1493;&#1501;. The mourning of the flood is to be taken as equivalent to drying up, so that the streams which issued from it were deprived of their water. Lebanon, i.e., the cedar-forest (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-34.htm">Isaiah 10:34</a>), and all the other trees, mourned over the fall of the cedar Asshur. &#1492;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1497;&#1512;, to clothe in black, i.e., to turn into mourning. &#1506;&#1500;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; is regarded by Ewald as a Pual formed after the Aramean mode, that is to say, by attaching the syllable ae instead of doubling the middle radical; whilst Hitzig proposes to change the form into &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492;. In any case the word must be a perfect Pual, as a nomen verbale appears unsuitable; and it must also be a third person feminine, the termination &#1470;&#1492; being softened into &#1470;&#1492;, as in &#1494;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1492; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-5.htm">Isaiah 59:5</a>), and the doubling of the &#1500; being dropped on account of the Sheva; so that the plural is construed with the singular feminine (Ewald, 317a). &#1506;&#1500;&#1468;&#1507;, to faint with grief (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-20.htm">Isaiah 51:20</a>). The thought is the following: all nature was so painfully affected by the fall of Asshur, that the whole of the resources from which its prosperity and might had been derived were dried up. To interpret the different figures as specially relating to princes and nations appears a doubtful procedure, for the simple reason that in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-16.htm">Ezekiel 31:16</a> the trembling of the nations is expressly named.<p>Whilst all the nations on the surface of the earth tremble at the fall of Assyria, because they are thereby warned of the perishable nature of all earthly greatness and of their own destruction, the inhabitants of the nether world console themselves with the thought that the Assyrian is now sharing their fate (for this thought, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-31.htm">Ezekiel 32:31</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-9.htm">Isaiah 14:9-10</a>). "All the trees of Eden" are all the powerful and noble princes. The idea itself, "trees of Eden," is explained by the apposition, "the choice and beautiful ones of Lebanon," i.e., the picked and finest cedars, and still further strengthened by the expression &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1497;  (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-14.htm">Ezekiel 31:14</a>). &#1502;&#1489;&#1495;&#1512; are connected, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/9-2.htm">1 Samuel 9:2</a>; and both words are placed side by side in the construct state, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/1-4.htm">Daniel 1:4</a> (cf. Ewald, 339b). They comfort themselves because they have gone down with him into Sheol, so that he has no advantage over them. They come thither to those pierced with the sword, i.e., to the princes and peoples whom Asshur slew in wars to establish his imperial power. &#1493;&#1468;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; might also belong to &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468; as a second subject. In that case &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1510;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493; should be taken in a relative sense: "and his arm," i.e., his resources, "which sat in his shadow among the nations." With this explanation &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; would be different from &#1492;&#1501;, and could only denote the army of the Assyrian. But this does not harmonize with the sitting in his shadow among the nations, for these words obviously point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>; so that &#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; is evidently meant to correspond to &#1499;&#1468;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501; &#1512;&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-6.htm">Ezekiel 31:6</a>), and is actually identical with &#1492;&#1501;, i.e., with all the trees of Eden. We therefore agree with Osiander, Grotius, and others, in regarding the whole of the second hemistich as more precisely determining the subject, - in other words, as a declaration of the reason for their descending into hell along with the Assyrians, - and render the passage thus: "for as his arm (as his might) they sat in his shadow among the nations;" so that the cop. w is used in place of a causal particle. In any case, the conjecture which Ewald has adopted from the lxx and the Syriac, viz., &#1493;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493;, and his seed, in support of which appeal might be made to <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-21.htm">Isaiah 14:21</a>, is unsuitable, for the simple reason that the statement, that it sat in his shadow among the nations, does not apply. - After this description of the greatness and the destruction of the imperial power of Assyria, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-18.htm">Ezekiel 31:18</a> the question already asked in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-3.htm">Ezekiel 31:3</a> : to whom is Pharaoh like? &#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1492;, so, i.e., under such circumstances, when the glorious cedar Asshur has been smitten by such a fate (Hitzig). The reply to this question is really contained in the description given already; so that it is immediately followed by the announcement, "and thou wilt be thrust down," etc. &#1506;&#1512;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, uncircumcised, equivalent to ungodly heathen '&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; &#1508;, not "he is," as that would require &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506;&#1492; &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488;; but &#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1488; is the predicate: this is (i.e., so does it happen to) Pharaoh. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-2.htm">Ezekiel 31:2</a>. </body></html>
