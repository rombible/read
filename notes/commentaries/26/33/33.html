By the fulfilment of his prophecies of judgment they had already been brought to an outward recognition of his authority; it remained that by the fulfilment of the prophecies yet to come their hearts, or at least the hearts of the better part of them, should be bowed in true submission to the Divine will, as made known through him.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/33.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-33.htm" title="And when this comes to pass, (see, it will come,) then shall they know that a prophet has been among them.">Ezekiel 33:33</a></span>. <span class="ital">And when this cometh to pass, </span>(<span class="ital">lo, it will come</span>) — Or, rather, <span class="ital">lo, it is come; </span>for so the same phrase is translated <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,">Ezekiel 6:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm" title="In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.">Ezekiel 6:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-10.htm" title="And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.">Ezekiel 6:10</a>, the verb being in the present tense; when they shall see thy prophecies concerning the destruction of Jerusalem actually fulfilled, and all the events predicted by thee exactly brought to pass; <span class="ital">then shall they know that a prophet hath been among them — </span>Then shall they be convinced of the truth of thy mission, and of their own inexcusable crime in despising thy prophecies.

But whether men hear or forbear, they will know by the event that a servant of God has been among them.

The words can scarcely refer to the immediately preceding predictions in Vers. 27, 28, which were primarily addressed to "the people in the waste places," the remnant left in Judah, and we have to go back to the wider, more general teaching of Vers. 10-20. That was the prophet's message of judgment, his call to repentance. When the judgment should come, as it surely would, then they would know, in the bitterness of self-condemnation, that they had been listening, not to a hireling singer, but to a prophet of Jehovah. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/32.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Fifth strophe. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-29.htm">Ezekiel 32:29</a>. There are Edom, its kings and all its princes, who in spite of their bravery are associated with those that are pierced with the sword; they lie with the uncircumcised and with those that have gone down into the pit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a>. There are princes of the north, all of them, and all the Sidonians who have gone down to the slain, been put to shame in spite of the dread of them because of their bravery; they lie there as uncircumcised, and bear their shame with those who have gone into the pit. - In this strophe Ezekiel groups together the rest of the heathen nations in the neighbourhood of Israel; and in doing so, he changes the &#1513;&#1473;&#1501; of the preceding list for &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492;, thither. This might be taken prophetically: thither will they come, "to these they also belong" (Hvernick), only such nations being mentioned here as are still awaiting their destruction. But, in the first place, the perfects &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512; &#1497;&#1512;&#1491;&#1493;&#1468;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-29.htm">Ezekiel 32:29</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-30.htm">Ezekiel 32:30</a>, do not favour this explanation, inasmuch as they are used as preterites in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-22.htm">Ezekiel 32:22</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-26.htm">Ezekiel 32:26</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-27.htm">Ezekiel 32:27</a>; and, secondly, even in the previous strophes, not only are such peoples mentioned as have already perished, but some, like Elam and Meshech-Tubal, which did not rise into historical importance, or exert any influence upon the development of the kingdom of God till after Ezekiel's time, whereas the Edomites and Sidonians were already approaching destruction. We therefore regard &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; as simply a variation of expression in the sense of "thither have they come," without discovering any allusion to the future. - In the case of Edom, kings and &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1488;&#1497;&#1501;, i.e., tribe-princes, are mentioned. The allusion is to the 'alluphim or phylarchs, literally chiliarchs, the heads of the leading families (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-15.htm">Genesis 36:15</a>.), in whose hands the government of the people lay, inasmuch as the kings were elective, and were probably chosen by the phylarchs (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-31.htm">Genesis 36:31</a>.). &#1489;&#1468;&#1490;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, in, or with their bravery, i.e., in spite of it. There is something remarkable in the allusion to princes of the north (&#1504;&#1505;&#1497;&#1499;&#1497;, lit., persons enfeoffed, vassal-princes; see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-21.htm">Joshua 13:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-4.htm">Micah 5:4</a>) in connection with the Sidonians, and after Meshech-Tubal the representative of the northern nations. The association with the Sidonians renders the conjecture a very natural one, that allusion is made to the north of Palestine, and more especially to the Aram of Scripture, with its many separate states and princes (Hvernick); although <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-26.htm">Jeremiah 25:26</a>, "the kings of the north, both far and near," does not furnish a conclusive proof of this. So much, at any rate, is certain, that the princes of the north are not to be identified with the Sidonians. For, as Kliefoth has correctly observed, "there are six heathen nations mentioned, viz., Asshur, Elam, Meshech-Tubal, Edom, the princes of the north, and Sidon; and if we add Egypt to the list, we shall have seven, which would be thoroughly adapted, as it was eminently intended, to depict the fate of universal heathenism." A principle is also clearly discernible in the mode in which they are grouped. Asshur, Elam, and Meshech-Tubal represent the greater and more distant world-powers; Edom the princes of the north, and Sidon the neighbouring nations of Israel on both south and north. &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1501; &#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1501;, literally, in dread of them, (which proceeded) from their bravery, i.e., which their bravery inspired. '&#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-24.htm">Ezekiel 32:24</a>.</body></html>
