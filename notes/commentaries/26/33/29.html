Many claim an interest in the peculiar blessings to true believers, while their conduct proves them enemies of God. They call this groundless presumption strong faith, when God's testimony declares them entitled to his threatenings, and nothing else.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/33.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ye stand upon your sword - Ye put your trust in your swords.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/33.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>28. most desolate&#8212;(Jer 4:27; 12:11).<p>none &#8230; pass through&#8212;from fear of wild beasts and pestilence [Grotius].<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/33.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> I would have had them acknowledge me to be the Lord by my blessings which beautified the land, by my holy precepts which directed to piety and justice, by my mercy and kindness towards them; but they despised my mercy, broke my law, abused my bounty; and now by the punishment of their sins, as I threatened, and by laying the land most waste, they shall be constrained to own and submit to me as the Lord. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/33.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Then shall they know that I am the Lord,....

There is Elam, and all its multitude round about its grave; all of them slain, fallen by the sword, who went down uncircumcised into the nether world, who spread terror before them in the land of the living, and bear their shame with those who went into the pit. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a>. In the midst of the slain have they made it a bed with all its multitude, round about it are their graves; all of them uncircumcised, pierced with the sword; because terror was spread before them in the land of the living, they bear their shame with those who have gone into the pit. In the midst of slain ones is he laid. - Asshur is followed by &#1506;&#1497;&#1500;&#1501;, Elam, the warlike people of Elymais, i.e., Susiana, the modern Chusistan, whose archers served in the Assyrian army (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/22-6.htm">Isaiah 22:6</a>), and which is mentioned along with the Medes as one of the conquerors of Babylon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-2.htm">Isaiah 21:2</a>), whereas Jeremiah prophesied its destruction at the commencement of Zedekiah's reign (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-34.htm">Jeremiah 49:34</a>.). Ezekiel says just the same of Elam as he has already said of Asshur, and almost in the same words. The only difference is, that his description is more copious, and that he expresses more distinctly the thought of shameful destruction which is implied in the fact of lying in Sheol among the slain, and repeats it a second time, and that he also sets the bearing of shame into Sheol in contrast with the terror which Elam had spread around it during its life on earth. &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488; , as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-52.htm">Ezekiel 16:52</a>.

The last clause in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-25.htm">Ezekiel 32:25</a> is an emphatic repetition of the leading thought: he (Elam) is brought or laid in the midst of the slain.</body></html>
