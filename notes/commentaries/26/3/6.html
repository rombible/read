Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the success might be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>To many people - To various nations using diverse languages.<p>Surely - The thought is that expressed by our Saviour Himself (margin reference).

The prophet was sent, not to different nations, of different languages; but to one nation of the same language; indeed several of his prophecies concern other nations, as the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Tyrians, Philistines, Egyptians, and Assyrians; but then these had a relation to the, people of Israel, and were chiefly on their account; and therefore he was not sent to those nations to deliver his prophecies unto them, but to the people of Israel only; and so had no difficulty on his part concerning their language, which he would have had, had he been sent to the barbarous nations; <p>whose words, thou canst not understand: the prophet being, only used to the language of the Jews and not having the gift of speaking with and understanding divers tongues; as the apostles of Christ had, when they were sent to many people of different languages, and which is here tacitly intimates: <p>surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee; which is an aggravation of the obstinacy and disobedience of the people of Israel; that had the barbarous nations been favoured with the same means of instruction they were they would have been obedient; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21</a>; for though they could not understand the prophet's language, nor he theirs; yet, as Kimchi observes, they would have sought for an interpreter to have explained the prophecy to them. The thing is very strongly affirmed, "surely", verily,  "of a truth"; as the same Jewish writer interprets ; and both he and Jarchi take it to be the form of an oath. Some render the words, "if I had not sent thee to them, they would have hearkened unto thee" (i); and the sense is, either that if the Lord had not sent him to the Israelites, but to the peopled a strange speech, they, the people, would have hearkened to him: or, if the Lord had not sent the prophet, but he had gone of himself, as the false prophets in their own name, the Israelites would have hearkened to him; such was their perverseness and rebellion: others render the words, "if not", or had it not been for their strange speech and hard language, "I would have sent thee to them" (k), the barbarous nation, and "they would have hearkened unto thee"; but the first sense seems best; which is confirmed by the Targum, Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, and the Oriental versions. <p>(i)    "si non ad eos misissem te", Vatablus; "si non misero te", Montanus; "si non mitterem", Pagninus.

The last words, however, cannot mean “understand thee;” they mean “hearken unto thee,” as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm" title="But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.">Ezekiel 3:7</a></span>, where the phrase is the same.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/3.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 6.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Surely, if I sent thee to them,</span> etc. The "surely" represents the Hebrew "if not" taken as a strong affirmation, just as "if" in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/95-11.htm">Psalm 95:11</a> represents a strong negation; compare the use of the fuller <span class="accented">formula jurandi</span> in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/3-17.htm">1 Samuel 3:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/19-13.htm">2 Samuel 19:13</a>; and of the same in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/1-35.htm">Deuteronomy 1:35</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/62-8.htm">Isaiah 62:8</a>; and in Ezekiel himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/17-19.htm">Ezekiel 17:19</a>). The margin of the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">If I had sent thee to them, would they not have hearkened</span>, etc.? expresses the same meaning, but is less tenable as a translation. The thought in either case finds its analogue in our Lord's reference to Sodom and Gomorrah, to Tyre and Sidon (<a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/11-21.htm">Matthew 11:21-24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/10-12.htm">Luke 10:12-14</a>).

And He said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to the rebels who have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have fallen away from me, even until this very day. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>. And the children are of hard face, and hardened heart. To them I send thee; and to them shalt thou speak: Thus says the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>. And they - they may hear thee or fail (to do so); for they are a stiff-necked race - they shall experience that a prophet has been in their midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. But thou, son of man, fear not before them, and be not afraid of their words, if thistles and thorns are found about thee, and thou sittest upon scorpions; fear not before their words, and tremble not before their face; for they are a stiff-necked race. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>. And speak my words to them, whether they may hear or fail (to do so); for they are stiff-necked.<p>The children of Israel have become heathen, no longer a people of God, not even a heathen nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>), but &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, "heathens," that is, as being rebels against God. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (with the article) is not to be joined as an adjective to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which is without the article, but is employed substantively in the form of an apposition. They have rebelled against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, as in the Pentateuch; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, etc.). Like their fathers, the sons are rebellious, and, in addition, they are &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, of hard countenance"  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;, "of hard brow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>), i.e., impudent, without hiding the face, or lowering the look for shame. This shamelessness springs from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, sive-sive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), they shall in any case experience that a prophet has been amongst them. That they will neglect to hear is very probable, because they are a stiff-necked race (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, "house"  equals  family). The Vau before &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>) introduces the apodosis. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is perfect, not present. This is demanded by the usus loquendi and the connection of the thought. The meaning is not: they shall now from his testimony that a prophet is there; but they shall experience from the result, viz., when the word announced by him will have been fulfilled, that a prophet has been amongst them. Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony against their sins. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, are not, with the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: "rebelles et renuentes," but are substantives. As regards &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the signification "thorn" is placed beyond doubt by &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; in Aramaic does indeed denote "refractarius;" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; is related to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, "to burn, to singe," and means "urtica," "stinging-nettle, thistle," as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; is, according to the later usage, for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, expressing the "by and with of association," and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words "to sit on (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) scorpions," as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. </body></html>
