Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him.

And He said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to the rebels who have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have fallen away from me, even until this very day. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>. And the children are of hard face, and hardened heart. To them I send thee; and to them shalt thou speak: Thus says the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>. And they - they may hear thee or fail (to do so); for they are a stiff-necked race - they shall experience that a prophet has been in their midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. But thou, son of man, fear not before them, and be not afraid of their words, if thistles and thorns are found about thee, and thou sittest upon scorpions; fear not before their words, and tremble not before their face; for they are a stiff-necked race. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>. And speak my words to them, whether they may hear or fail (to do so); for they are stiff-necked.<p>The children of Israel have become heathen, no longer a people of God, not even a heathen nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>), but &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, "heathens," that is, as being rebels against God. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (with the article) is not to be joined as an adjective to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which is without the article, but is employed substantively in the form of an apposition. They have rebelled against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, as in the Pentateuch; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, etc.). Like their fathers, the sons are rebellious, and, in addition, they are &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, of hard countenance"  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;, "of hard brow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>), i.e., impudent, without hiding the face, or lowering the look for shame. This shamelessness springs from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, sive-sive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), they shall in any case experience that a prophet has been amongst them. That they will neglect to hear is very probable, because they are a stiff-necked race (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, "house"  equals  family). The Vau before &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>) introduces the apodosis. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is perfect, not present. This is demanded by the usus loquendi and the connection of the thought. The meaning is not: they shall now from his testimony that a prophet is there; but they shall experience from the result, viz., when the word announced by him will have been fulfilled, that a prophet has been amongst them. Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony against their sins. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, are not, with the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: "rebelles et renuentes," but are substantives. As regards &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the signification "thorn" is placed beyond doubt by &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; in Aramaic does indeed denote "refractarius;" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; is related to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, "to burn, to singe," and means "urtica," "stinging-nettle, thistle," as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; is, according to the later usage, for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, expressing the "by and with of association," and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words "to sit on (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) scorpions," as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. </body></html>
