Gracious souls can receive those truths of God with delight, which speak terror to the wicked. He must speak all that, and that only, which God spake to him. How can we better speak God's mind than with his words? If disappointed as to his people, he must not be offended. The Ninevites were wrought upon by Jonah's preaching, when Israel was unhumbled and unreformed. We must leave this unto the Divine sovereignty, and say, Lord, thy judgments are a great deep. They will not regard the word of the prophet, for they will not regard the rod of God. Christ promises to strengthen him. He must continue earnest in preaching, whatever the success might be.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/3.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Adamant - Or, diamond <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>, which was employed to cut flint.

This <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">schamir</span> they say was a worm, which by secret virtue would, when applied, cut or form hard stones, and divide the greatest; that Moses used it to prepare the precious stones for the breastplate, and Solomon, they say, used it to fit the stones without hammer for the temple. Well then, Ezekiel, fear not, thou shalt be a <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">schamir</span> to the Jews in captivity, and fit some of them to be either rich ornaments in the breastplate, or beautiful stones in the temple; go about thy work, it shall not be, though it seem, successless. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Fear them not; </span> let no prevailing fear take thee quite off from thy work; let not any lesser surprises and sudden discomposures of mind, when thou appearest before them, unfit thee for this work I set thee about. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A rebellious house; </span> as a house that is rebellion itself. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/3.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead,.... Or, "than a rock" (o); the "adamant" has its name in Greek, because it cannot be conquered or subdued, neither by the hammer, nor by fire; the one cannot break, nor this other consume it; land it is called "shamir" in Hebrew, from its preserving itself from both; it will cut iron in pieces, which is harder than stone, and therefore must be harder than that. Bochart takes it to be the same with "smiris", a hard stone, which jewellers use to polish their gems with; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a>. The design of the simile is to set forth the courage and fortitude of mind the prophet was endowed with, in order to face an impudent and hardhearted people; <p>fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. <p>(o) "rupe", Junius &amp; Tremellius, Polanus, Piscator; "prae rupe", Cocceius; "ex rupe", Starckius; "prae petra", Montanus. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/3.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/3.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">9</span>. <span class="ital">harder than flint</span>] Cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-3.htm" title="O LORD, are not your eyes on the truth? you have stricken them, but they have not grieved; you have consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.">Jeremiah 5:3</a>, “they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return.”<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">though they</span> be <span class="ital">a rebellious</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">for they are.</span> See ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm" title="And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. What gave the prophet invincible courage in the face of the opposition of the people was in the main the assurance that he was sent of God, that God was with him, and that his word was given him to speak.

The Hebrew word <span class="accented">shemir</span> is used in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/17-1.htm">Jeremiah 17:1</a> (where the Authorized Version gives "diamond" for a stone used in engraving on gems. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/7-12.htm">Zechariah 7:12</a> it appears, as it does here, as a type of exceeding hardness. It is not found elsewhere in the Old Testament. It is commonly identified with the stone known as <span class="accented">corundum</span>, which appears in some of its forms as the sapphire and the Oriental ruby, and also as the stone the powder of which is used as emery. The special point of the comparison is, of course, that the adamant was actually used to cut either flint itself or stones as hard as flint. <span class="cmt_word">Neither be dismayed at their looks.</span> The words indicate the extreme sensitiveness of the prophet's natural temperament. He had shrunk not only from the threats and revilings of the rebellious house, but even from their scowls of hatred. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/2.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The calling of the prophet begins with the Lord describing to Ezekiel the people to whom He is sending him, in order to make him acquainted with the difficulties of his vocation, and to encourage him for the discharge of the same.  <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-3.htm">Ezekiel 2:3</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to the rebels who have rebelled against me: they and their fathers have fallen away from me, even until this very day. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-4.htm">Ezekiel 2:4</a>. And the children are of hard face, and hardened heart. To them I send thee; and to them shalt thou speak: Thus says the Lord Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>. And they - they may hear thee or fail (to do so); for they are a stiff-necked race - they shall experience that a prophet has been in their midst. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>. But thou, son of man, fear not before them, and be not afraid of their words, if thistles and thorns are found about thee, and thou sittest upon scorpions; fear not before their words, and tremble not before their face; for they are a stiff-necked race. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-7.htm">Ezekiel 2:7</a>. And speak my words to them, whether they may hear or fail (to do so); for they are stiff-necked.<p>The children of Israel have become heathen, no longer a people of God, not even a heathen nation (&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-4.htm">Isaiah 1:4</a>), but &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, "heathens," that is, as being rebels against God. &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1493;&#1512;&#1491;&#1497;&#1501; (with the article) is not to be joined as an adjective to &#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1497;&#1501;, which is without the article, but is employed substantively in the form of an apposition. They have rebelled against God in this, that they, like their fathers, have separated themselves from Jehovah down to this day (as regards &#1508;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506; &#1489;&#1468;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-2.htm">Isaiah 1:2</a>; and &#1506;&#1510;&#1501; &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501; &#1492;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;, as in the Pentateuch; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-14.htm">Leviticus 23:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/7-13.htm">Genesis 7:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/17-23.htm">Genesis 17:23</a>, etc.). Like their fathers, the sons are rebellious, and, in addition, they are &#1511;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497; &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, of hard countenance"  equals  &#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1497;, "of hard brow" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-7.htm">Ezekiel 3:7</a>), i.e., impudent, without hiding the face, or lowering the look for shame. This shamelessness springs from hardness of heart. To these hardened sinners Ezekiel is to announce the word of the Lord. Whether they hear it or not (&#1488;&#1501;&#1470;&#1493;&#1488;&#1501;, sive-sive, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/24-15.htm">Joshua 24:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-3.htm">Ecclesiastes 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/12-14.htm">Ecclesiastes 12:14</a>), they shall in any case experience that a prophet has been amongst them. That they will neglect to hear is very probable, because they are a stiff-necked race (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;, "house"  equals  family). The Vau before &#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5</a>) introduces the apodosis. &#1492;&#1497;&#1492; is perfect, not present. This is demanded by the usus loquendi and the connection of the thought. The meaning is not: they shall now from his testimony that a prophet is there; but they shall experience from the result, viz., when the word announced by him will have been fulfilled, that a prophet has been amongst them. Ezekiel, therefore, is not to be prevented by fear of them and their words from delivering a testimony against their sins. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3be; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;, &#1505;&#1512;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; and &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, are not, with the older expositors, to be explained adjectively: "rebelles et renuentes," but are substantives. As regards &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, the signification "thorn" is placed beyond doubt by &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>, and &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; in Aramaic does indeed denote "refractarius;" but this signification is a derived one, and inappropriate here. &#1505;&#1512;&#1489; is related to &#1510;&#1512;&#1489;, "to burn, to singe," and means "urtica," "stinging-nettle, thistle," as Donasch in Raschi has already explained it. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1498; is, according to the later usage, for &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1498;, expressing the "by and with of association," and occurs frequently in Ezekiel. Thistles and thorns are emblems of dangerous, hostile men. The thought is strengthened by the words "to sit on (&#1488;&#1500; for &#1506;&#1500;) scorpions," as these animals inflict a painful and dangerous wound. For the similitude of dangerous men to scorpions, cf. Sir. 26:10, and other proof passages in Bochart, Hierozoic. III. p. 551f., ed. Rosenmll. </body></html>
