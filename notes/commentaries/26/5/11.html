The balance of clauses here: I also will—and mine eye shall not spare: I also will not pity, appears to shew that the word expresses one idea along with the words “mine eye shall not spare.” This can hardly be expressed otherwise than: I also will withdraw mine eye and it shall not spare; I also will have no pity. For the phrase “withdraw the eye” cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm" title="He withdraws not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings are they on the throne; yes, he does establish them for ever, and they are exalted.">Job 36:7</a>.

Targ. Vulg. render “hew down,” but this kind of reading (<span class="ital">d</span> for <span class="ital">r</span>) is too familiar to be of any value.

This was, after all, the root evil of all other evils. Pollution of worship, the degradation of the highest element in man's nature, passed into pollution and degradation of his whole life.

Most recent critics suggest conjectural  emendations of the text. I incline to rest satisfied with the Authorized Version, and to explain it by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-27.htm">Ezekiel 16:27</a>. The word implies not only the decrease, but the entire withdrawal of Jehovah's favour. Possibly there is an implied reference to the command of <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/4-2.htm">Deuteronomy 4:2</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-32.htm">Deuteronomy 12:32</a>.

The words are, of course, anthropomorphic, and have therefore to be received with the necessary limitations.

Lord, Jehovah, my soul has never been polluted; and of a carcase, and of that which is torn, have I never eaten from my youth up until now, and abominable flesh has not come into my mouth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a>. Then said He unto me: Lo, I allow thee the dung of animals instead of that of man; therewith mayest thou prepare thy bread. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>. And He said to me, Son of man, lo, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, so that they will eat bread according to weight, and in affliction, and drink water by measure, and in amazement. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a>. Because bread and water shall fail, and they shall pine away one with another, and disappear in their guilt. - For the whole duration of the symbolical siege of Jerusalem, Ezekiel is to furnish himself with a store of grain corn and leguminous fruits, to place this store in a vessel beside him, and daily to prepare in the form of bread a measured portion of the same, 20 shekels in weight (about 9 ounces), and to bake this as barley cakes upon a fire, prepared with dried dung, and then to partake of it at the different hours for meals throughout the day. In addition to this, he is, at the hours appointed for eating, to drink water, in like manner according to measure, a sixth part of the hin daily, i.e., a quantity less than a pint (cf. Biblisch. Archol. II. p. 141). The Israelites, probably, generally prepared the &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; from wheat flour, and not merely when they had guests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/18-6.htm">Genesis 18:6</a>). Ezekiel, however, is to take, in addition, other kinds of grain with leguminous fruits, which were employed in the preparation of bread when wheat was deficient; barley - baked into bread by the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/7-13.htm">Judges 7:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/4-42.htm">2 Kings 4:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/6-9.htm">John 6:9</a>; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-8.htm">1 Kings 5:8</a>); &#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1500;, "beans," a common food of the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/17-28.htm">2 Samuel 17:28</a>), which appears to have been mixed with other kinds of grain for the purpose of being baked into bread.<p>(Note: Cf. Plinii Histor. Natur. xviii. 30: "Inter legumina maximus honos fabae, quippe ex qua tentatus sit etiam panis...Frumento etiam miscetur apud plerasque gentes et maxime panico solida ac delicatius fracta.")<p>This especially holds true of the lentiles, a favourite food of the Hebrews (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-29.htm">Genesis 25:29</a>.), from which, in Egypt at the present day, the poor still bake bread in times of severe famine (Sonnini, R. II. 390; &#x3b1;&#787;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c6;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;, Athenaeus, IV. 158). &#1491;&#1468;&#1495;&#1503;, "millet," termed by the Arabs "Dochn" (Arab. dchn), panicum, a fruit cultivated in Egypt, and still more frequently in Arabia (see Wellsted, Arab. I. 295), consisting of longish round brown grain, resembling rice, from which, in the absence of better fruits, a sort of bad bread is baked. Cf. Celsius, Hierobotan, i. 453ff.; and Gesen. Thesaur. p. 333. &#1499;&#1468;&#1505;&#1468;&#1502;&#1497;&#1501;, "spelt or German corn" (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/9-32.htm">Exodus 9:32</a>), a kind of grain which produces a finer and whiter flour than wheat flour; the bread, however, which is baked from it is somewhat dry, and is said to be less nutritive than wheat bread; cf. Celsius, Hierobotan, ii. 98f. Of all these fruits Ezekiel is to place certain quantities in a vessel - to indicate that all kinds of grain and leguminous fruits capable of being converted into bread will be collected, in order to bake bread for the appeasing of hunger. In the intermixture of various kinds of flour we are not, with Hitzig, to seek a transgression of the law in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-19.htm">Leviticus 19:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-9.htm">Deuteronomy 22:9</a>. &#1502;&#1505;&#1508;&#1468;&#1512; is the accusative of measure or duration. The quantity is to be fixed according to the number of the days. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a> only the 390 days of the house of Israel's period of punishment are mentioned - quod plures essent et fere universa summa (Prado); and because this was sufficient to make prominent the hardship and oppression of the situation, the 40 days of Judah were omitted for the sake of brevity.<p>(Note: Kliefoth's supposition is untenable, that what is required in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-17</a> refers in reality only to the 390 days of Israel, and not also to the 40 days of Judah, so that so long as Ezekiel lay and bore the sins of Israel, he was to eat his food by measure, and unclean. For this is in contradiction with the distinct announcement that during the whole time that he lay upon the one side and the other, he was besieging Jerusalem; and by the scanty and unclean food, was to portray both the deficiency of bread and water which occurred in the besieged city (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a>), as well as the eating of unclean bread, which impended over the Israelites when among the heathen nations. The famine which took place in Jerusalem during the siege did not affect the ten tribes, but that of Judah; while unclean bread had to be eaten among the heathen not only by the Israelites, but also by the Jews transported to Babylon. By the limitation of what is prescribed to the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9-15</a> to the time during which the sin of Israel was to be borne, the significance of this symbolical act for Jerusalem and Judah is taken away.)<p>&#1502;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, "thy food which thou shalt eat," i.e., the definite portion which thou shalt have to eat, shall be according to weight (between subject and predicate the substantive verb is to be supplied). Twenty shekels  equals  8 or 9 ounces of flour, yield 11 or 12 ounces of bread, i.e., at most the half of what a man needs in southern countries for his daily support.<p>(Note: In our climate (Germany) we count 2 lbs. of bread for the daily supply of a man; but in warm countries the demand for food is less, so that scarcely 1 1/2 lbs. are required. Wellsted (Travels in Arabia, II. p. 200) relates that "the Bedoweens will undertake a journey of 10 to 12 days without carrying with them any nutriment, save a bottle full of small cakes, baked of white flour and camel or goat's milk, and a leather bag of water. Such a cake weighs about 5 ounces. Two of them, and a mouthful of water, the latter twice within 24 hours, is all which they then partake of.")<p>The same is the case with the water. A sixth part of a hin, i.e., a quantity less than a pint, is a very niggardly allowance for a day. Both, however - eating the bread and drinking the water - he shall do from time to time, i.e., "not throughout the entire fixed period of 390 days" (Hvernick); but he shall not eat the daily ration at once, but divided into portions according to the daily hours of meals, so that he will never be completely satisfied. In addition to this is the pollution (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>.) of the scanty allowance of food by the manner in which it is prepared. &#1506;&#1504;&#1468;&#1514; &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is predicate: "as barley cakes," shalt thou eat them. The suffix in &#1514;&#1468;&#1488;&#1499;&#1500;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is neuter, and refers to &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-9.htm">Ezekiel 4:9</a>, or rather to the kinds of grain there enumerated, which are ground and baked before them: &#1500;&#1495;&#1501;, i.e., "food." The addition &#1513;&#1474;&#1506;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; is not to be explained from this, that the principal part of these consisted of barley, nor does it prove that in general no other than barley cakes were known (Hitzig), but only that the cakes of barley meal, baked in the ashes, were an extremely frugal kind of bread, which that prepared by Ezekiel was to resemble. The &#1506;&#1490;&#1468;&#1492; was probably always baked on hot ashes, or on hot stones (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/19-6.htm">1 Kings 19:6</a>), not on pans, as Kliefoth here supposes. The prophet, however, is to bake them in (with) human ordure. This is by no means to be understood as if he were to mix the ordure with the food, for which view <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-12.htm">Isaiah 36:12</a> has been erroneously appealed to; but - as &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-15.htm">Ezekiel 4:15</a> clearly shows - he is to bake it over the dung, i.e., so that dung forms the material of the fire. That the bread must be polluted by this is conceivable, although it cannot be proved from the passages in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/5-3.htm">Leviticus 5:3</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-21.htm">Leviticus 7:21</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/23-13.htm">Deuteronomy 23:13</a> that the use of fire composed of dung made the food prepared thereon levitically unclean. The use of fire with human ordure must have communicated to the bread a loathsome smell and taste, by which it was rendered unclean, even if it had not been immediately baked in the hot ashes. That the pollution of the bread is the object of this injunction, we see from the explanation which God gives in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-13.htm">Ezekiel 4:13</a> : "Thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the heathen." The heart of the prophet, however, rebels against such food. He says he has never in his life polluted himself by eating food forbidden in the law; from his youth up he has eaten no unclean flesh, neither of a carcase, nor of that which was torn by wild beasts (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-30.htm">Exodus 22:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/14-21.htm">Deuteronomy 14:21</a>), nor flesh of sacrifices decayed or putrefying (&#1508;&#1468;&#1490;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-18.htm">Leviticus 7:18</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/65-4.htm">Isaiah 65:4</a>). On this God omits the requirement in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-12.htm">Ezekiel 4:12</a>, and permits him to take for firing the dung of oxen instead of that of men.<p>(Note: The use of dung as a material for burning is so common in the East, that it cannot be supposed that Ezekiel first became acquainted with it in a foreign country, and therefore regarded it with peculiar loathing. Human ordure, of course, so far as our knowledge goes, is never so employed, although the objection raised by Hitzig, on the other hand, that it would not yield so much heat as would be necessary for roasting without immediate contact, i.e., through the medium of a brick, rests upon an erroneous representation of the matter. But the employment of cattle-dung for firing could not be unknown to the Israelites, as it forms in the Huaran (the ancient Bashan) the customary firing material; cf. Wetzstein's remarks on Delitzsch's Job, vol. I. pp. 377, 8 (Eng. trn.), where the preparation of the g'elle - this prevalent material for burning in the Hauran - from cow-dung mixed with chopped straw is minutely described; and this remark is made among others, that the flame of the g'elle, prepared and dried from the dung of oxen that feed at large, is entirely without smoke, and that the ashes, which retain their heat for a lengthened time, are as clean as those of wood.)<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>., finally, is given the explanation of the scanty allowance of food meted out to the prophet, namely, that the Lord, at the impending siege of Jerusalem, is to take away from the people the staff of bread, and leave them to languish in hunger and distress. The explanation is in literal adherence to the threatenings of the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), which are now to pass into fulfilment. Bread is called "staff of bread" as being indispensable for the preservation of life. To &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1511;&#1500;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-26.htm">Leviticus 26:26</a>, &#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1488;&#1490;&#1492;, "in sorrow," is added; and to the water, &#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, "in astonishment," i.e., in fixed, silent pain at the miserable death, by hunger and thirst, which they see before them. &#1504;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501; as <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>. If we, finally, cast a look over the contents of this first sign, it says that Jerusalem is soon to be besieged, and during the siege is to suffer hunger and terror as a punishment for the sins of Israel and Judah; that upon the capture of the city of Israel (Judah) they are to be dispersed among the heathen, and will there be obliged to eat unclean bread. To this in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5.htm">Ezekiel 5</a> is joined a second sign, which shows further how it shall fare with the people at and after the capture of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-1.htm">Ezekiel 4:1-4</a>); and after that a longer oracle, which developes the significance of these signs, and establishes the necessity of the penal judgment (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-5.htm">Ezekiel 4:5-17</a>). </body></html>
