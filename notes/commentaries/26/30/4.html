Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The time of the pagan - The time when the pagan (Egyptians) shall be judged. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>4. pain&#8212;literally, "pangs with trembling as of a woman in childbirth."<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The sword:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-8.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will bring a sword on you, and cut off man and beast out of you.">Ezekiel 29:8</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">In Ethiopia; </span> next neighbour and ally to Egypt; they shall tremble at so great danger, so near, and they uncertain whether it will come on them, but very certain to be ruined if it does come, and as certain that they have cause to suspect it will come on them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">When the slain shall fall in Egypt; </span> when the Egyptians, under the eye of the Ethiopians, shall fall in battle, and at the taking of their towns. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">They shall take away her multitude; </span> in miserable captivity carry them to Babylon, by whole droves. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Her foundations, </span> their government, laws, counsellors, strong holds, which are to a nation as foundations to a house, are destroyed. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And the sword shall come upon Egypt,.... The sword of the Chaldeans shall come upon the Egyptians, by which they should be cut off; it having a commission from the Lord for that purpose: <p>and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt; Ethiopia being a neighbouring nation to Egypt, shall be in a panic when it shall hear of the sword of the Chaldeans being in Egypt, and of the ravages made by it, of the multitudes slain with it; fearing it will be their turn next to fall into the same hands, and in the same manner; and the rather, not only as they were neighbours, but allies: <p>and they shall take away her multitude; that is, the Chaldeans shall carry captive vast numbers of the Egyptians; such as fell not by the sword should not escape the hand of the enemy, but be taken and carried into other lands. Egypt was a very populous country; according to Agrippa's speech in Josephus (f), there were in it 7,500,000 persons from Ethiopia to Alexandria, besides the inhabitants of the latter, as might be gathered from the tribute each person paid; hence they are compared to the trees of a forest that cannot be searched, and to grasshoppers innumerable, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-23.htm">Jeremiah 46:23</a>, but now their numbers should be lesser: <p>and her foundations shall be broken down; either in a literal sense, the foundations of the cities, towers, and fortified places in Egypt, should be undermined and destroyed, and consequently the buildings on them must sink and fall; or in a figurative sense, her king, princes, magistrates, laws, and government, which are the support of a state, should be removed, and be of no more service. <p>(f) De Bello Jud. l. 2. c. 16. sect. 4. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/30.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And the sword shall come upon Egypt, and great pain shall be in Ethiopia, when the slain shall fall in Egypt, and they shall take away her multitude, and her foundations shall be broken down.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/30.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">4</span>. <span class="ital">great pain</span>] <span class="bld">anguish</span>, a late word, cf. <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-9.htm" title="In that day shall messengers go forth from me in ships to make the careless Ethiopians afraid, and great pain shall come on them, as in the day of Egypt: for, see, it comes.">Ezekiel 30:9</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">her multitude</span>] Ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-19.htm" title="Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall take her multitude, and take her spoil, and take her prey; and it shall be the wages for his army.">Ezekiel 29:19</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm" title="Behold, therefore I am against you, and against your rivers, and I will make the land of Egypt utterly waste and desolate, from the tower of Syene even to the border of Ethiopia.">Ezekiel 29:10</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-15.htm" title="It shall be the basest of the kingdoms; neither shall it exalt itself any more above the nations: for I will diminish them, that they shall no more rule over the nations.">Ezekiel 29:15</a>, ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-2.htm" title="Son of man, speak to Pharaoh king of Egypt, and to his multitude; Whom are you like in your greatness?">Ezekiel 31:2</a>. Her “foundations” is suggested by the idea of a building overthrown. Reference is hardly to the allies and mercenaries on whom Egypt relied in war, rather to the classes and institutions in which the strength of the state lay.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/30.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 4.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Great pain shall be in Ethiopia</span>. The words point to the extension of the invasion of Egypt - by Nebuchadnezzar in the first instance, and afterwards by other conquerors - to the upper valley of the Nile. <span class="cmt_word">They shall take away her multitude</span>. The word is taken by Keil, Smend, and others of things rather than persons, the multitude of possessions. Hengstenberg renders "tumult" in the sense of the stir of a crowded city. The <span class="cmt_word">foundations</span> are probably to be taken figuratively of the bases of the prosperity of Egypt, its allies and mercenaries, rather than of actual buildings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/11-3.htm">Psalm 11:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/82-5.htm">Psalm 82:5</a>). </body></html>
