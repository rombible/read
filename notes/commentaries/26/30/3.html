It is the time of Jehovah’s final interposition in the world to do judgment, to chastise evil, and give the crowning victory to his own cause. This day has a universal bearing: particularly, it falls in terror and calamity upon the heathen, the foes of Jehovah’s kingdom, but also upon the sinners in Zion, those who are at ease and settled on their lees (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-12.htm" title="And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do good, neither will he do evil.">Zephaniah 1:12</a>), on the proud and the oppressors of the poor (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/2-12.htm" title="For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be on every one that is proud and lofty, and on every one that is lifted up; and he shall be brought low:">Isaiah 2:12</a>). The presentiment of this day is common to all the prophets, and the knowledge of it exists among the people (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/5-18.htm" title="Woe to you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.">Amos 5:18</a>). The feeling of its nearness, however, was awakened in various ways: either by great convulsions among the nations or calamities, in which Jehovah was so visibly operating that his final interposition seemed at hand (Isaiah 13; <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/1-7.htm" title="Hold your peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of the LORD is at hand: for the LORD has prepared a sacrifice, he has bid his guests.">Zephaniah 1:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-1.htm" title="Blow you the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the day of the LORD comes, for it is near at hand;">Joel 2:1</a>); or, by a moral condition of the world which it was felt he must intervene to chastise and put an end to (Isaiah 2, 3). Naturally the convulsions or calamities which awakened the presentiment of the nearness of the day passed over and the day was deferred, but this does not justify the supposition that the prophets mean merely a great calamity or judgment by the day of the Lord.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">the time of the heathen</span>] the <span class="bld">nations</span>, the foes of Jehovah’s kingdom and people, when Jehovah shall be revealed to them and they shall be judged.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a>. Son of man, raise a lamentation over the king of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Thou seal of a well-measured building, full of wisdom and perfect in beauty. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>. In Eden, the garden of God, was thou; all kinds of precious stones were thy covering, cornelian, topaz, and diamond, chrysolite, beryl, and jasper, sapphire, carbuncle, and emerald, and gold: the service of thy timbrels and of thy women was with thee; on the day that thou wast created, they were prepared. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>. Thou wast a cherub of anointing, which covered, and I made thee for it; thou wast on a holy mountain of God; thou didst walk in the midst of fiery stones. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a>. Thou wast innocent in thy ways from the day on which thou wast created, until iniquity was found in thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>. On account of the multitude of thy commerce, thine inside was filled with wrong, and thou didst sin: I will therefore profane thee away from the mountain of God; and destroy thee, O covering cherub, away from the fiery stones! <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a>. Thy heart has lifted itself up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom together with thy splendour: I cast thee to the ground, I give thee up for a spectacle before kings. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Ezekiel 28:18</a>. Through the multitude of thy sins in thine unrighteous trade thou hast profaned thy holy places; I therefore cause fire to proceed from the midst of thee, which shall devour thee, and make thee into ashes upon the earth before the eyes of all who see thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-19.htm">Ezekiel 28:19</a>. All who know thee among the peoples are amazed at thee: thou hast become a terror, and art gone for ever. - The lamentation over the fall of the king of Tyre commences with a picture of the super-terrestrial glory of his position, so as to correspond to his self-deification as depicted in the foregoing word of God. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-12.htm">Ezekiel 28:12</a> he is addressed as &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;. This does not mean, "artistically wrought signet-ring;" for &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; does not stand for &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; , but is a participle of &#1495;&#1514;&#1501; , to seal. There is all the more reason for adhering firmly to this meaning, that the following predicate, &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; &#1495;&#1499;&#1502;&#1492;, is altogether inapplicable to a signet-ring, though Hitzig once more scents a corruption of the text in consequence. &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1504;&#1497;&#1514;, from &#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503;, to weigh, or measure off, does not mean perfection (Ewald), beauty (Ges.), faon (Hitzig), or symmetry (Hvernick); but just as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/43-10.htm">Ezekiel 43:10</a>, the only other passage in which it occurs, it denotes the measured and well-arranged building of the temple, so here it signifies a well-measured and artistically arranged building, namely, the Tyrian state in its artistic combination of well-measured institutions (Kliefoth). This building is sealed by the prince, inasmuch as he imparts to the state firmness, stability, and long duration, when he possesses the qualities requisite for a ruler. These are mentioned afterwards, namely, "full of wisdom, perfect in beauty." If the prince answers to his position, the wisdom and beauty manifest in the institutions of the state are simply the impress received from the wisdom and beauty of his own mind. The prince of Tyre possessed such a mind, and therefore regarded himself as a God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>). His place of abode, which is described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>, corresponded to his position. Ezekiel here compares the situation of the prince of Tyre with that of the first man in Paradise; and then, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>, draws a comparison between his fall and the fall of Adam. As the first man was placed in the garden of God, in Eden, so also was the prince of Tyre placed in the midst of paradisaical glory. &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; is shown, by the apposition &#1490;&#1468;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501;, to be used as the proper name of Paradise; and this view is not to be upset by the captious objection of Hitzig, that Eden was not the Garden of God, but that this was situated in Eden (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-8.htm">Genesis 2:8</a>). The fact that Ezekiel calls Paradise &#1490;&#1468;&#1503;&#1470;&#1506;&#1491;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-35.htm">Ezekiel 36:35</a>, proves nothing more than that the terms Eden and Garden of God do not cover precisely the same ground, inasmuch as the garden of God only occupied one portion of Eden. But notwithstanding this difference, Ezekiel could use the two expressions as synonymous, just as well as Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>). And even if any one should persist in pressing the difference, it would not follow that &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1491;&#1503; was corrupt in this passage, as Hitzig fancies, but simply that &#1490;&#1503;  defined the idea of &#1506;&#1491;&#1503; more precisely - in other words, restricted it to the garden of Paradise.<p>There is, however, another point to be observed in connection with this expression, namely, that the epithet &#1490;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1492;&#1497;&#1501; is used here and in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/31-8.htm">Ezekiel 31:8-9</a>; whereas, in other places, Paradise is called &#1490;&#1503; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/51-3.htm">Isaiah 51:3</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/13-10.htm">Genesis 13:10</a>). Ezekiel has chosen Elohim instead of Jehovah, because Paradise is brought into comparison, not on account of the historical significance which it bears to the human race in relation to the plan of salvation, but simply as the most glorious land in all the earthly creation. the prince of Tyre, placed in the pleasant land, was also adorned with the greatest earthly glory. Costly jewels were his coverings, that is to say, they formed the ornaments of his attire. This feature in the pictorial description is taken from the splendour with which Oriental rulers are accustomed to appear, namely, in robes covered with precious stones, pearls, and gold. &#1502;&#1505;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492;, as a noun &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.., signifies a covering. In the enumeration of the precious stones, there is no reference to the breastplate of the high priest. For, in the first place, the order of the stones is a different one here; secondly, there are only nine stones named instead of twelve; and lastly, there would be no intelligible sense in such a reference, so far as we can perceive. Both precious stones and gold are included in the glories of Eden (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/2-11.htm">Genesis 2:11-12</a>). For the names of the several stones, see the commentary on <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/28-17.htm">Exodus 28:17-20</a>. The words '&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514; &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;' s - which even the early translators have entirely misunderstood, and which the commentators down to Hitzig and Ewald have made marvellous attempts to explain - present no peculiar difficulty, apart from the plural &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1498;, which is only met with here. As the meaning timbrels, tambourins (aduffa), is well established for &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501;, and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/10-5.htm">1 Samuel 10:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-12.htm">Isaiah 5:12</a> flutes are mentioned along with the timbrels, it has been supposed by some that &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; must signify flutes here. But there is nothing to support such a rendering either in the Hebrew or in the other Semitic dialects. On the other hand, the meaning pala gemmarum (Vulgate), or ring-casket, has been quite arbitrarily forced upon the word by Jerome, Rosenmller, Gesenius, and many others. We agree with Hvernick in regarding &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1497;&#1501; as a plural of &#1504;&#1511;&#1489;&#1492; (foeminae), formed, like a masculine, after the analogy of &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, &#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1490;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, etc., and account for the choice of this expression from the allusion to the history of the creation (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/1-27.htm">Genesis 1:27</a>). The service (&#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1499;&#1514;, performance, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/39-11.htm">Genesis 39:11</a>, etc.) of the women is the leading of the circular dances by the odalisks who beat the timbrels: "the harem-pomp of Oriental kings." This was made ready for the king on the day of his creation, i.e., not his birthday, but the day on which he became king, or commenced his reign, when the harem of his predecessor came into his possession with all its accompaniments. Ezekiel calls this the day of his creation, with special reference to the fact that it was God who appointed him king, and with an allusion to the parallel, underlying the whole description, between the position of the prince of Tyre and that of Adam in Paradise.<p>(Note: In explanation of the fact alluded to, Hvernick has very appropriately called attention to a passage of Athen. (xii. 8, p. 531), in which the following statement occurs with reference to Strato, the Sidonian king: "Strato, with flute-girls, and female harpers and players on the cithara, made preparations for the festivities, and sent for a large number of hetaerae from the Peloponnesus, and many signing-girls from Ionia, and young hetaerae from the whole of Greece, both singers and dancers." See also other passages in Brissonius, de regio Pers. princ. pp. 142-3.)<p>The next verse (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a>) is a more difficult one. &#1488;&#1514;&#1468; is an abbreviation of &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;, &#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/11-15.htm">Numbers 11:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/5-24.htm">Deuteronomy 5:24</a> (see Ewald, 184a). The hap. leg. &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; has been explained in very different ways, but mostly according to the Vulgate rendering, tu Cherub extentus et protegens, as signifying spreading out or extension, in the sense of "with outspread wings" (Gesenius and many others.). But &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; does not mean either to spread out or to extend. The general meaning of the word is simply to anoint; and judging from &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1495; and &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1492;, portio, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/7-35.htm">Leviticus 7:35</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/18-8.htm">Numbers 18:8</a>, also to measure off, from which the idea of extension cannot possibly be derived. Consequently the meaning "anointing" is the only one that can be established with certainty in the case of the word &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;. So far as the form is concerned, &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; might be in the construct state; but the connection with &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498;, anointing, or anointed one, of the covering one, does not yield any admissible sense.<p>A comparison with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>, where &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; occurs again, will show that the &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;, which stands between these two words in the verse before us, must contain a more precise definition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, and therefore is to be connected with &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; in the construct state: cherub of anointing, i.e., anointed cherub. This is the rendering adopted by Kliefoth, the only commentator who has given the true explanation of the verse. &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; is the older form, which has only been retained in a few words, such as &#1502;&#1512;&#1502;&#1505; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-6.htm">Isaiah 10:6</a>, together with the tone-lengthened a (vid., Ewald, 160a). The prince of Tyre is called an anointed cherub, as Ephraem Syrus has observed, because he was a king even though he had not been anointed. &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; is not an abstract noun, either here or in <a href="http://biblehub.com/nahum/2-6.htm">Nahum 2:6</a>, but a participle; and this predicate points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/25-20.htm">Exodus 25:20</a>, "the cherubim covered (&#1505;&#1493;&#1499;&#1499;&#1497;&#1501;) the capporeth with their wings," and is to be explained accordingly. Consequently the king of Tyre is called a cherub, because, as an anointed king, he covered or overshadowed a sanctuary, like the cherubim upon the ark of the covenant. What this sanctuary was is evident from the remarks already made at <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a> concerning the divine seat of the king. If the "seat of God," upon which the king of Tyre sat, is to be understood as signifying the state of Tyre, then the sanctuary which he covered or overshadowed as a cherub will also be the Tyrian state, with its holy places and sacred things. In the next clause, &#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1498; is to be taken by itself according to the accents, "and I have made thee (so)," and not to be connected with &#1489;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512; &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473;. We are precluded from adopting the combination which some propose - viz. "I set thee upon a holy mountain; thou wast a God" - by the incongruity of first of all describing the prince of Tyre as a cherub, and then immediately afterwards as a God, inasmuch as, according to the Biblical view, the cherub, as an angelic being, is simply a creature and not a God; and the fanciful delusion of the prince of Tyre, that he was an El (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-2.htm">Ezekiel 28:2</a>), could not furnish the least ground for his being addressed as Elohim by Ezekiel. And still more are we precluded from taking the words in this manner by the declaration contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>, that Jehovah will cast him out "from the mountain of Elohim," from which we may see that in the present verse also Elohim belongs to har, and that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>, where the mountain of God is mentioned again, the predicate &#1511;&#1491;&#1513;&#1473; is simply omitted for the sake of brevity, just as &#1502;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495; is afterwards omitted on the repetition of &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498;. The missing but actual object to &#1504;&#1514;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1498; can easily be supplied from the preceding clause, - namely, this, i.e., an overshadowing cherub, had God made him, by placing him as king in paradisaical glory. The words, "thou wast upon a holy mountain of God," are not to be interpreted in the sense suggested by <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-13.htm">Isaiah 14:13</a>, namely, that Ezekiel was thinking of the mountain of the gods (Alborj) met with in Asiatic mythology, because it was there that the cherub had its home, as Hitzig and others suppose; for the Biblical idea of the cherub is entirely different from the heathen notion of the griffin keeping guard over gold. It is true that God placed the cherub as guardian of Paradise, but Paradise was not a mountain of God, nor even a mountainous land. The idea of a holy mountain of God, as being the seat of the king of Tyre, was founded partly upon the natural situation of Tyre itself, built as it was upon one or two rocky islands of the Mediterranean, and partly upon the heathen notion of the sacredness of this island as the seat of the Deity, to which the Tyrians attributed the grandeur of their state. To this we may probably add a reference to Mount Zion, upon which was the sanctuary, where the cherub covered the seat of the presence of God. For although the comparison of the prince of Tyre to a cherub was primarily suggested by the description of his abode as Paradise, the epithet &#1492;&#1505;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; shows that the place of the cherub in the sanctuary was also present to the prophet's mind. At the same time, we must not understand by &#1492;&#1512; Mount Zion itself. The last clause, "thou didst walk in the midst of (among) fiery stones," is very difficult to explain. It is admitted by nearly all the more recent commentators, that "stones of fire" cannot be taken as equivalent to "every precious stone" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-13.htm">Ezekiel 28:13</a>), both because the precious stones could hardly be called stones of fire on account of their brilliant splendour, and also being covered with precious stones is not walking in the midst of them. Nor can we explain the words, as Hvernick has done, from the account given by Herodotus (II 44) of the two emerald pillars in the temple of Hercules at Tyre, which shone resplendently by night; for pillars shining by night are not stones of fire, and the king of Tyre did not walk in the temple between these pillars. The explanation given by Hofmann and Kliefoth appears to be the correct one, namely, that the stones of fire are to be regarded as a wall of fire (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zechariah/2-9.htm">Zechariah 2:9</a>), which rendered the cherubic king of Tyre unapproachable upon his holy mountain.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-15.htm">Ezekiel 28:15</a>, the comparison of the prince of Tyre to Adam in Paradise is brought out still more prominently. As Adam was created sinless, so was the prince of Tyre innocent in his conduct in the day of his creation, but only until perverseness was found in him. As Adam forfeited and lost the happiness conferred upon him through his fall, so did the king of Tyre forfeit his glorious position through unrighteousness and sin, and cause God to cast him from his eminence down to the ground. He fell into perverseness in consequence of the abundance of his trade (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>). Because his trade lifted him up to wealth and power, his heart was filled with iniquity. &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1502;&#1500;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468;, like &#1502;&#1500;&#1493; for &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1488; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/41-8.htm">Ezekiel 41:8</a>, and &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1493;&#1468; for &#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39-26.htm">Ezekiel 39:26</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; is not the subject, but the object to &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;; and the plural &#1502;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;, with an indefinite subject, "they filled," is chosen in the place of the passive construction, because in the Hebrew, as in the Aramaean, active combinations are preferred to passive whenever it is possible to adopt them (vid., Ewald, 294b and 128b). &#1502;&#1500;&#1488; is used by Ezekiel in the transitive sense "to fill" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8-17.htm">Ezekiel 8:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-11.htm">Ezekiel 30:11</a>). &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1498;, the midst, is used for the interior in a physical sense, and not in a spiritual one; and the expression is chosen with an evident allusion to the history of the fall. As Adam sinned by eating the forbidden fruit of the tree, so did the king of Tyre sin by filling himself with wickedness in connection with trade (Hvernick and Kliefoth). God would therefore put him away from the mountain of God, and destroy him. &#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500; with &#1502;&#1503; is a pregnant expression: to desecrate away from, i.e., to divest of his glory and thrust away from. &#1493;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; is a contracted form for &#1493;&#1488;&#1488;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1498; (vid., Ewald, 232h and 72c). - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-17.htm">Ezekiel 28:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-18.htm">Ezekiel 28:18</a> contain a comprehensive description of the guilt of the prince of Tyre, and the approaching judgment is still further depicted. &#1506;&#1500;  cannot mean, "on account of thy splendour," for this yields no appropriate thought, inasmuch as it was not the splendour itself which occasioned his overthrow, but the pride which corrupted the wisdom requisite to exalt the might of Tyre, - in other words, tempted the prince to commit iniquity in order to preserve and increase his glory. We therefore follow the lxx, Syr., Ros., and others, in taking &#1506;&#1500; in the sense of una cum, together with. &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1492; is an infinitive form, like &#1488;&#1492;&#1489;&#1492; for &#1512;&#1488;&#1493;&#1514;, though Ewald (238e) regards it as so extraordinary that he proposes to alter the text. &#1512;&#1488;&#1492; with &#1489; is used for looking upon a person with malicious pleasure. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; &#1512;&#1499;&#1500;&#1468;&#1514;&#1498; shows in what the guilt (&#1506;&#1493;&#1503;) consisted (&#1506;&#1493;&#1500; is the construct state of &#1506;&#1493;&#1500;). The sanctuaries (miqda&#770;shim) which the king of Tyre desecrated by the unrighteousness of his commerce, are not the city or the state of Tyre, but the temples which made Tyre a holy island. These the king desecrated by bringing about their destruction through his own sin. Several of the codices and editions read &#1502;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498; in the singular, and this is the reading adopted by the Chaldee, Syriac, and Vulgate versions. If this were the true reading, the sanctuary referred to would be the holy mountain of God (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-14.htm">Ezekiel 28:14</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>). But the reading itself apparently owes its origin simply to this interpretation of the words. In the clause, "I cause fire to issue from the midst of thee," &#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; is to be understood in the same sense as &#1514;&#1468;&#1493;&#1499;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-16.htm">Ezekiel 28:16</a>. The iniquity which the king has taken into himself becomes a fire issuing from him, by which he is consumed and burned to ashes. All who know him among the peoples will be astonished at his terrible fall (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-19.htm">Ezekiel 28:19</a>, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-36.htm">Ezekiel 27:36</a>).<p>If we proceed, in conclusion, to inquire into the fulfilment of these prophecies concerning Tyre and its king, we find the opinions of modern commentators divided. Some, for example Hengstenberg, Hvernick, Drechsler (on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>), and others, assuming that, after a thirteen years' siege, Nebuchadnezzar conquered the strong Island Tyre, and destroyed it; while others - viz. Gesenius, Winer, Hitzig, etc. - deny the conquest by Nebuchadnezzar, or at any rate call it in question; and many of the earlier commentators suppose the prophecy to refer to Old Tyre, which stood upon the mainland. For the history of this dispute, see Hengstenberg, De rebus Tyriorum comment. (Berol. 1832); Hvernick, On Ezekiel, pp. 420ff.; and Movers, Phoenizier, II 1, pp. 427ff. - The denial of the conquest of Insular Tyre by the king of Babylon rests partly on the silence which ancient historians, who mention the siege itself, have maintained as to its result; and partly on the statement contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17-20</a>. - All that Josephus (Antt. x. 11. 1) is able to quote from the ancient historians on this point is the following: - In the first place, he states, on the authority of the third book of the Chaldean history of Berosus, that when the father of Nebuchadnezzar, on account of his own age and consequent infirmity, had transferred to his son the conduct of the war against the rebellious satrap in Egypt, Coelesyria, and Phoenicia, Nebuchadnezzar defeated him, and brought the whole country once more under his sway. But as the tidings reached him of the death of his father just at the same time, after arranging affairs in Egypt, and giving orders to some of his friends to lead into Babylon the captives taken from among the Judaeans, the Phoenicians, the Syrians, and the Egyptians, together with the heavy armed portion of the army, he himself hastened through the desert to Babylon, with a small number of attendants, to assume that government of the empire. Secondly, he states, on the authority of the Indian and Phoenician histories of Philostratus, that when Ithobal was on the throne, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre for thirteen years. The accounts taken from Berosus are repeated by Josephus in his c. Apion (i. 19), where he also adds (20), in confirmation of their credibility, that there were writings found in the archives of the Phoenicians which tallied with the statement made by Berosus concerning the king of Chaldea (Nebuchadnezzar), viz., "that he conquered all Syria and Phoenicia;" and that Philostratus also agrees with this, since he mentions the siege of Tyre in his histories (&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#x3bc;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;&#x3bc;&#x3b5;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3bf;&#x3c2; &#x3c4;&#x3b7;&#834;&#x3c2; &#x3a4;&#x3c5;&#769;&#x3c1;&#x3bf;&#x3c5; &#x3c0;&#x3bf;&#x3bb;&#x3b9;&#x3bf;&#x3c1;&#x3ba;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3b1;&#x3c2;). In addition to this, for synchronistic purposes, Josephus (c. Ap. i. 21) also communicates a fragment from the Phoenician history, containing not only the account of the thirteen years' siege of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar in the reign of Ithobal, but also a list of the kings of Tyre who followed Ithobal, down to the time of Cyrus of Persia.<p>(Note: The passage reads as follows: "In the reign of Ithobal the king, Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre for thirteen years. After him judges were appointed. Ecnibalus, the son of Baslachus, judged for two months; Chelbes, the son of Abdaeus, for ten months; Abbarus, the high priest, for three months; Myttonus and Gerastartus, the sons of Abdelemus, for six years; after whom Balatorus reigned for one year. When he died, they sent for and fetched Merbalus from Babylon, and he reigned four years. At his death they sent for his brother Eiramus, who reigned twenty years. During his reign, Cyrus ruled over the Persians.")<p>The siege of Tyre is therefore mentioned three times by Josephus, on the authority of Phoenician histories; but he never says anything of the conquest and destruction of that city by Nebuchadnezzar. From this circumstance the conclusion has been drawn, that this was all he found there. For if, it is said, the siege had terminated with the conquest of the city, this glorious result of the thirteen years' exertions could hardly have been passed over in silence, inasmuch as in Antt. x. 11. 1 the testimony of foreign historians is quoted to the effect that Nebuchadnezzar was "an active man, and more fortunate than the kings that were before him." But the argument is more plausible than conclusive. If we bear in mind that Berosus simply relates the account of a subjugation and devastation of the whole of Phoenicia, without even mentioning the siege of Tyre, and that it is only in Phoenician writings therefore that the latter is referred to, we cannot by any means conclude, from their silence as to the result or termination of the siege, that it ended gloriously for the Tyrians and with humiliation to Nebuchadnezzar, or that he was obliged to relinquish the attempt without success after the strenuous exertions of thirteen years. On the contrary, considering how all the historians of antiquity show the same anxiety, if not to pass over in silence, such events as were unfavourable to their country, at all events to put them in as favourable to their country, at all events to put them in as favourable a light as possible, the fact that the Tyrian historians observe the deepest silence as to the result of the thirteen years' siege of Tyre would rather force us to the conclusion that it was very humiliating to Tyre. And this could only be the case if Nebuchadnezzar really conquered Tyre at the end of thirteen years. If he had been obliged to relinquish the siege because he found himself unable to conquer so strong a city, the Tyrian historians would most assuredly have related this termination of the thirteen years' strenuous exertions of the great and mighty king of Babylon.<p>The silence of the Tyrian historians concerning the conquest of Tyre is no proof, therefore, that it did not really take place. But <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-17.htm">Ezekiel 29:17-20</a> has also been quoted as containing positive evidence of the failure of the thirteen years' siege; in other words, of the fact that the city was not taken. We read in this passage, that Nebuchadnezzar caused his army to perform hard service against Tyre, and that neither he nor his army received any recompense for it. Jehovah would therefore give him Egypt to spoil and plunder as wages for this work of theirs in the service of Jehovah. Gesenius and Hitzig (on <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/23.htm">Isaiah 23</a>) infer from this, that Nebuchadnezzar obtained no recompense for the severe labour of the siege, because he did not succeed in entering the city. But Movers (l.c. p. 448) has already urged in reply to this, that "the passage before us does not imply that the city was not conquered any more than it does the opposite, but simply lays stress upon the fact that it was not plundered. For nothing can be clearer in this connection than that what we are to understand by the wages, which Nebuchadnezzar did not receive, notwithstanding the exertions connected with his many years' siege, is simply the treasures of Tyre;" though Movers is of opinion that the passage contains an intimation that the siege was brought to an end with a certain compromise which satisfied the Tyrians, and infers, from the fact of stress being laid exclusively upon the neglected plundering, that the termination was of such a kind that plundering might easily have taken place, and therefore that Tyre was either actually conquered, but treated mildly from wise considerations, or else submitted to the Chaldeans upon certain terms. But neither of these alternatives can make the least pretension to probability. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-20.htm">Ezekiel 29:20</a> it is expressly stated that "as wages, for which he (Nebuchadnezzar) has worked, I give him the land of Egypt, because they (Nebuchadnezzar and his army) have done it for me;" in other words, have done the work for me. When, therefore, Jehovah promises to give Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar as a reward or wages for the hard work which has been done for Him at Tyre, the words presuppose that Nebuchadnezzar had really accomplished against Tyre the task entrusted to him by God. But God had committed to him not merely the siege, but also the conquest and destruction of Tyre. Nebuchadnezzar must therefore have executed the commission, though without receiving the expected reward for the labour which he had bestowed; and on that account God would compensate him for his trouble with the treasures of Egypt. This precludes not only the supposition that the siege was terminated, or the city surrendered, on the condition that it shou</body></html>
