It was built by Menes (s), the Mizraim of the Scriptures, the first king of Egypt; though Diodorus Siculus (t) makes Uchoreus to be the founder of it. Some interpreters take this city to be the same with what is now called Alkair, or Grand Cairo; or, however, that this is built upon the same spot, or near the same place that was, in which I have followed them on <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-13.htm">Isaiah 19:13</a> whereas Cairo stands right over against old Memphis, the Nile being between them, on the east side of it, and Memphis on the west; as is clear from Herodotus (u), and from the charts of Dr. Shaw, and Mr. Norden; and who observe, that some take the place of it to have been where a village now stands, Dr. Shaw calls Geza, and Mr. Norden Gize: <p>and there shall be no more a prince of the land of Egypt; that is, a native of that country; or that should rule over the whole of it, and in that grandeur the kings of Egypt had before; or, however, not dwell in Memphis, which was the seat of the kings of Egypt, but now should be so no more: when Egypt was conquered by Nebuchadnezzar, it was under the Babylonians; and then under the Persians; and then under the Greeks; and afterwards under the Romans; since under the Saracens and Mamalucks; and now in the hands of the Turks; so that it never recovered its former glory; and indeed, after Nectanebus was driven out of it by Ochus, king of Persia, it never after had a king: <p>and I will put a fear in all the land of Egypt; a panic in all the inhabitants of it; as soon as they shall hear of the king of Babylon entering into it, their courage, bravery, and fortitude, shall at once leave them, and they shall be dispirited, and have no heart to defend themselves, and oppose the enemy. <p>(s) Herodot, Euterpe, sive l. 2. c. 99.

The word of God against Sidon brings to a close the cycle of predictions of judgment directed against those heathen nations which had given expression to malicious pleasure at the overthrow of the kingdom of Judah. There is therefore appended a promise for Israel (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>), which is really closely connected with the threatening words directed against the heathen nations, and for which the way is prepared by <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>. The correspondence of &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1492;&#1468; (I shall be sanctified in her) in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a> to &#1504;&#1511;&#1491;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; &#1489;&#1501; (I shall be sanctified in them) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a>, serves to place the future fate of Israel in antithesis not merely to the future fate of Sidon, but, as <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a> clearly show, to that of all the heathen nations against which the previous threats have been directed.<p><a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-20.htm">Ezekiel 28:20-24</a><p>And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-21.htm">Ezekiel 28:21</a>. Son of man, direct thy face towards Sidon, and prophesy against it, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>. And say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will be against thee, O Sidon, and will glorify myself in the midst of thee; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I execute judgments upon it, and sanctify myself upon it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-23.htm">Ezekiel 28:23</a>. I will send pestilence into it, and blood into its streets; slain will fall in the midst of it by the sword, which cometh upon it from every side; and they shall learn that I am Jehovah. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a>. And there shall be no more to the house of Israel a malignant thorn and smarting sting from all round about them, who despise them; but they shall learn that I am the Lord Jehovah. - Jehovah will glorify Himself as the Lord upon Sidon, as He did before upon Pharaoh (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-4.htm">Exodus 14:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/14-16.htm">Exodus 14:16-17</a>, to which the word &#1504;&#1499;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-22.htm">Ezekiel 28:22</a>, an unusual expression for Ezekiel, evidently points). The glorification is effected by judgments, through which He proves Himself to be holy upon the enemies of His people. He executes the judgments through pestilence and blood (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-22.htm">Ezekiel 38:22</a>), i.e., through disease and bloodshed occasioned by war, so that men fall, slain by the sword (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>). Instead of &#1504;&#1508;&#1500; we have the intensive form &#1504;&#1508;&#1500;&#1500;, which is regarded by Ewald and Hitzig as a copyist's error, because it is only met with here. Through these judgments the Lord will liberate His people Israel from all round about, who increase its suffering by their contempt. These thoughts sum up in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-24.htm">Ezekiel 28:24</a> the design of God's judgments upon all the neighbouring nations which are threatened in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25-28</a>, and thus prepare the way for the concluding promise in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-25.htm">Ezekiel 28:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/28-26.htm">Ezekiel 28:26</a>. The figure of the sting and thorn points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/33-55.htm">Numbers 33:55</a>, where it is said that the Canaanites whom Israel failed to exterminate would become thorns in its eyes and stings in its sides. As Israel did not keep itself free from the Canaanitish nature of the heathen nations, God caused it to fell these stings of heathenism. Having been deeply hurt by them, it was now lying utterly prostrate with its wounds. The sins of Canaan, to which Israel had given itself up, had occasioned the destruction of Jerusalem (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16.htm">Ezekiel 16</a>). But Israel is not to succumb to its wounds. On the contrary, by destroying the heathen powers, the Lord will heal His people of the wounds which its heathen neighbours have inflicted upon it. &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503;, synonymous with &#1505;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-6.htm">Ezekiel 2:6</a>, a word only found in Ezekiel. &#1502;&#1502;&#1488;&#1497;&#1512;, on the contrary, is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/13-51.htm">Leviticus 13:51</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/14-44.htm">Leviticus 14:44</a>, where it is applied to malignant leprosy (see the comm. on the former passage). - For &#1492;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-57.htm">Ezekiel 16:57</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a>.</body></html>
