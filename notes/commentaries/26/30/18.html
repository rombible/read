Here that sense is clearly inappropriate. The LXX. and Vulgate give "the scepters" of Egypt, which implies a different reading, and this is adopted in substance by Ewald and Smend, the latter preferring rendering it by "supports" or "props," the "red" being used as a "staff" rather than as a "scepter" (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-14.htm">Ezekiel 19:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-8.htm">Jeremiah 43:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-17.htm">Jeremiah 48:17</a>). <span class="cmt_word">The pomp of her strength</span>.

On the whole, looking to the mention of the "young men" in Ver. 17, the literal meaning seems preferable. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/29.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Judgment upon Pharaoh and His People and Land<p>Because Pharaoh looks upon himself as the creator of his kingdom and of his might, he is to be destroyed with his men of war (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-2.htm">Ezekiel 29:2-5</a>).

By &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; we are to understand the arms and canals of the Nile (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/7-18.htm">Isaiah 7:18</a>). The predicate, "lying in the midst of his rivers," points at once to the proud security in his own power to which Pharaoh gave himself up. As the crocodile lies quietly in the waters of the Nile, as though he were lord of the river; so did Pharaoh regard himself as the omnipotent lord of Egypt. His words affirm this: "the river is mine, I have made it for myself." The suffix attached to &#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1497;&#1514;&#1504;&#1497; stands in the place of &#1500;&#1497;, as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a>, where the suffix is wanting, clearly shows. There is an incorrectness in this use of the suffix, which evidently passed into the language of literature from the popular phraseology (cf. Ewald, 315b). The rendering of the Vulgate, ego feci memetipsum, is false. &#1497;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; is the expression used by him as a king who regards the land and its rivers as his own property; in connection with which we must bear in mind that Egypt is indebted to the Nile not only for its greatness, but for its actual existence. In this respect Pharaoh says emphatically &#1500;&#1497;, it is mine, it belongs to me, because he regards himself as the creator. The words, "I have made it for myself," simply explain the reason for the expression &#1500;&#1497;, and affirm more than "I have put myself in possession of this through my own power, or have acquired its blessings for myself" (Hvernick); or, "I have put it into its present condition by constructing canals, dams, sluices, and buildings by the river-side" (Hitzig). Pharaoh calls himself the creator of the Nile, because he regards himself as the creator of the greatness of Egypt. This pride, in which he forgets God and attributes divine power to himself, is the cause of his sin, for which he will be overthrown by God. God will draw the crocodile Pharaoh out of his Nile with hooks, and cast him upon the dry land, where he and the fishes that have been drawn out along with him upon his scales will not be gathered up, but devoured by the wild beasts and birds of prey. The figure is derived from the manner in which even in ancient times the crocodile was caught with large hooks of a peculiar construction (compare Herod. ii. 70, and the testimonies of travellers in Oedmann's Vermischten Sammlungen, III pp. 6ff., and Jomard in the Dscription de l'Egypte, <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_peter/27.htm">1 Peter 27</a>). The form &#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1501; with a double Yod is a copyist's error, probably occasioned by the double Yod occurring after &#1495; in &#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1495;&#1497;&#1497;&#1498;, which follows. A dual form for &#1495;&#1495;&#1497;&#1501; is unsuitable, and is not used anywhere else even by Ezekiel (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-4.htm">Ezekiel 19:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-9.htm">Ezekiel 19:9</a>, and more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/38-4.htm">Ezekiel 38:4</a>).<p>The fishes which hang upon the scales of the monster, and are drawn along with it out of the Nile, are the inhabitants of Egypt, for the Nile represents the land. The casting of the beast into the wilderness, where it putrefies and is devoured by the beasts and birds of prey, must not be interpreted in the insipid manner proposed by Hitzig, namely, that Pharaoh would advance with his army into the desert of Arabia and be defeated there. The wilderness is the dry and barren land, in which animals that inhabit the water must perish; and the thought is simply that the monster will be cast upon the desert land, where it will finally become the food of the beasts of prey.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6</a> the construction is a subject of dispute, inasmuch as many of the commentators follow the Hebrew division of the verse, taking the second hemistich '&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; as dependent upon the first half of the verse, for which it assigns the reason, and then interpreting <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a> as a further development of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6</a>, and commencing a new period with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-8.htm">Ezekiel 29:8</a> (Hitzig, Kliefoth, and others). But it is decidedly wrong to connect together the two halves of the sixth verse, if only for the simple reason that the formula &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492;, which occurs so frequently elsewhere in Ezekiel, invariably closes a train of thought, and is never followed by the addition of a further reason. Moreover, a sentence commencing with &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; is just as invariably followed by an apodosis introduced by &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, of which we have an example just below in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-10.htm">Ezekiel 29:10</a>. For both these reasons it is absolutely necessary that we should regard '&#1497;&#1506;&#1503; &#1492; as the beginning of a protasis, the apodosis to which commences with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-8.htm">Ezekiel 29:8</a>. The correctness of this construction is established beyond all doubt by the fact that from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-6.htm">Ezekiel 29:6</a> onwards it is no longer Pharaoh who is spoken of, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3-5</a>, but Egypt; so that &#1497;&#1506;&#1503; introduces a new train of thought. But <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a> is clearly shown, both by the contents and the form, to be an explanatory intermediate clause inserted as a parenthesis. And inasmuch as the protasis is removed in consequence to some distance from its apodosis, Ezekiel has introduced the formula "thus saith the Lord Jehovah" at the commencement of the apodosis, for the purpose of giving additional emphasis to the announcement of the punishment. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a> cannot in any case be regarded as the protasis, the apodosis to which commences with the &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-8.htm">Ezekiel 29:8</a>, and Hvernick maintains. The suffix attached to &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501;, to which Hitzig takes exception, because he has misunderstood the construction, and which he would conjecture away, refers to &#1502;&#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; as a land or kingdom. Because the kingdom of Egypt was a reed-staff to the house of Israel (a figure drawn from the physical character of the banks of the Nile, with its thick growth of tall, thick rushes, and recalling to mind <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/36-6.htm">Isaiah 36:6</a>), the Lord would bring the sword upon it and cut off from it both man and beast. But before this apodosis the figure of the reed-staff is more clearly defined: "when they (the Israelites) take thee by thy branches, thou breakest," etc. This explanation is not to be taken as referring to any particular facts either of the past or future, but indicates the deceptive nature of Egypt as the standing characteristic of that kingdom. At the same time, to give greater vivacity to the description, the words concerning Egypt are changed into a direct address to the Egyptians, i.e., not to Pharaoh, but to the Egyptian people regarded as a single individual. The expression &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1498; causes some difficulty, since the ordinary meaning of &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; (hand) is apparently unsuitable, inasmuch as the verb &#1514;&#1468;&#1512;&#1493;&#1509;, from &#1512;&#1510;&#1509;, to break or crack (not to break in pieces, i.e., to break quite through), clearly shows that the figure if the reed is still continued. The Keri &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1468;&#1507; is a bad emendation, based upon the rendering "to grasp with the hand," which is grammatically inadmissible. &#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1513;&#1474; with &#1489; does not mean to grasp with something, but to seize upon something, to take hold of a person (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/3-6.htm">Isaiah 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/9-17.htm">Deuteronomy 9:17</a>), so that &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1498; can only be an explanatory apposition to &#1489;&#1468;&#1498;. The meaning grip, or grasp of the hand, is also unsuitable and cannot be sustained, as the plural &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; alone is used in this sense in Sol 5:5. The only meaning appropriate to the figure is that of branches, which is sustained, so far as the language is concerned, by the use of the plural &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1493;&#1514; for palm-branches in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/23-40.htm">Leviticus 23:40</a>, and of the singular &#1499;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1492; for the collection of branches in <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/15-32.htm">Job 15:32</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/9-13.htm">Isaiah 9:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/19-15.htm">Isaiah 19:15</a>; and this is apparently in perfect harmony with natural facts, since the tall reed of the Nile, more especially the papyrus, is furnished with hollow, sword-shaped leaves at the lower part of the talk. When it cracks, the reed-staff pierces the shoulder of the man who has grasped it, and tears it; and if a man lean upon it, it breaks in pieces and causes all the loins to tremble. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1497;&#1491; cannot mean to cause to stand, or to set upright, still less render stiff and rigid. The latter meaning cannot be established from the usage of the language, and would be unsuitable here. For if a stick on which a man leans should break and penetrate his loins, it would inflict such injury upon them as to cause him to fall, and not to remain stiff and rigid. &#1492;&#1506;&#1502;&#1491; cannot have any other meaning than that of &#1492;&#1502;&#1506;&#1491;, to cause to tremble or relax, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/69-24.htm">Psalm 69:24</a>, to shake the firmness of the loins, so that the power to stand is impaired.<p>In the apodosis the thought of the land gives place to that of the people; hence the use of the feminine suffixes &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; and &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1498; in the place of the masculine suffixes &#1489;&#1468;&#1498; and &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-7.htm">Ezekiel 29:7</a>. Man and beast shall be cut off, and the land made into a desert waste by the sword, i.e., by war. This is carried out still further in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-9.htm">Ezekiel 29:9-12</a>; and once again in the protasis 9b (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-3.htm">Ezekiel 29:3</a>) the inordinate pride of the king is placed in the foreground as the reason for the devastation of his land and kingdom. The Lord will make of Egypt the most desolate wilderness. &#1495;&#1512;&#1489;&#1493;&#1514; is intensified into a superlative by the double genitive &#1495;&#1512;&#1489; &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;, desolation of the wilderness. Throughout its whole extent from Migdol, i.e., Magdolo, according to the Itiner. Anton. p. 171 (ed. Wessel), twelve Roman miles from Pelusium; in the Coptic Meshtol, Egyptian Ma&#768;ktr (Brugsch, Geogr. Inschr. I pp. 261f.), the most northerly place in Egypt. &#1505;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;, to Syene (for the construction see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a>), &#x3a3;&#x3c5;&#x3b7;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3b7;, Sun in the inscriptions, according to Brugsch (Geogr. Inschr. I. p. 155), probably the profane designation of the place (Coptic Souan), the most southerly border town of Egypt in the direction of Cush, i.e., Ethiopia, on the eastern bank of the Nile, some ruins of which are still to be seen in the modern Assvan (Assuan, Arab. aswa equals n), which is situated to the north-east of them (vid., Brugsch, Reiseber. aus. Aegypten, p. 247, and Leyrer in Herzog's Encyclopaedia). The additional clause, "and to the border of Cush," does not give a fresh terminal point, still further advanced, but simply defines with still greater clearness the boundary toward the south, viz., to Syene, where Egypt terminates and Ethiopia beings. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-11.htm">Ezekiel 29:11</a> the desolation is more fully depicted. &#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;, it will not dwell, poetical for "be inhabited," as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/4.htm">Joel 4</a> (3):20, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-20.htm">Isaiah 13:20</a>, etc. This devastation shall last for forty years, and so long shall the people of Egypt be scattered among the nations. But after the expiration of that time they shall be gathered together again (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-13.htm">Ezekiel 29:13</a>). The number forty is neither a round number (Hitzig) nor a very long time (Ewald), but is a symbolical term denoting a period appointed by God for punishment and penitence (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>), which is not to be understood in a chronological sense, or capable of being calculated.</body></html>
