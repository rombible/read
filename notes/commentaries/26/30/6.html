The Egyptians and Ethiopians being confederates, the ill news of the conquest of Egypt could not but greatly affect the Ethiopians.<a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>30:1-19 The prophecy of the destruction of Egypt is very full. Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>6. from the tower of Syene&#8212;(see on [1073]Eze 29:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They also that uphold Egypt; </span> either the princes, counsellors, and martial men in Egypt, or those abroad, that favour her and help her. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The pride of her power; </span> the glory of all her strength, of which she was proud. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall come down; </span> be trodden under foot.
