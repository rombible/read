Those who take their lot with God's enemies, shall be with them in punishment. The king of Babylon and his army shall be instruments of this destruction. God often makes one wicked man a scourge to another. No place in the land of Egypt shall escape the fury of the Chaldeans. The Lord is known by the judgments he executes. Yet these are only present effects of the Divine displeasure, not worthy of our fear, compared with the wrath to come, from which Jesus delivers his people.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/30.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>See the marginal reference note. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/30.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>7. in the midst of &#8230; countries &#8230; desolate&#8212;Egypt shall fare no better than they (Eze 29:10).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/30.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They shall know; </span> all that act, and all that suffer, in this tragedy, shall by the evidence of the things be enforced to own God’s hand, and ascribe justice, and truth, and glory to him. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">A fire; </span> that war, which like increasing fire consumeth all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Shall be destroyed; </span> the destruction of so many and powerful aids shall prove that it was God’s hand did it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/30.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>And they shall know that I am the Lord,....
