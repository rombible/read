Some of the ancient versions and some manuscripts have modified the text; but the meaning seems to be, if the text is taken as it stands, “Thy mother is like a vine living in the blood (<span class= "ital">i.e., </span>in the life) of her children.” This would then be a statement amplified in the following, “fruitful and full of branches.” The general sense is plain: Israel is described as having been planted a strong and fruitful vine, with every advantage for growth and full development.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/19.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/19-10.htm" title="Your mother is like a vine in your blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters....">Ezekiel 19:10-14</a></span>. <span class="ital">Thy mother is like a vine — </span>Here another similitude is made use of, and the Jewish nation is compared, as it frequently is in other places, to a vine. <span class="ital">In thy blood — </span>So the Hebrew and Vulgate; but the LXX. read, <span class="greekheb">ως ανθος εν ροα</span>, <span class="ital">as a flower on a pomegranate-tree; </span>and Bishop Newcome, who supposes the LXX. to have read <span class="greekheb">כרמן</span>, and not <span class="greekheb">בדמךְ</span>, renders the clause, <span class="ital">like a pomegranate, planted by the waters, </span>&c. — “The Jewish nation, whence the royal family had their original, was like a fruitful vine in a very flourishing condition.” <span class="ital">And she had strong rods,</span> &c. — From her sprung valiant princes, fit to sway the sceptre.

The clause is equivalent to "Thy mother is a vine, living in thy blood," i. e., in the life of thee and of thy children. The excellency of a vine is in her fruitful branches; the glory of a mother in her noble children. Jeremiah was to write Jehoiachin childless (see the note at <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/22-30.htm">Jeremiah 22:30</a>); Ezekiel here takes a general view of the king and princes of the blood royal. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10.

The Jews from the first were planted in Canaan to take root there [Calvin]. Grotius translates as the Margin, "in thy quietness," that is, in the period when Judah had not yet fallen into her present troubles. English Version is better. Glassius explains it well, retaining the metaphor, which Calvin's explanation breaks, "in the blood of thy grapes," that is, in her full strength, as the red wine is the strength of the grape.

Another simile is here made use of, relating to the same persons; the same that were compared to a lioness are here compared to a vine, as the people of the Jews frequently are, <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/80-8.htm">Psalm 80:8</a>; the same person is here addressed, the then reigning prince, Zedekiah, whose mother, the Jewish people, from whence he sprung, had been in times past, and still was, like a vine; and especially with respect to his blood, the royal family from, chore he descended: the allusion is to the use of blood laid to the roots of vines, by which they became more fruitful. It may have regard; as Calvin thinks, to the original of the Jewish nation, who, when in their blood, or as soon as they were born, that is, as soon as they became a nation, were at first like a flourishing vine. Some render the words, "in thy likeness"; so Jarchi, Kimchi, and Ben Melech; to which the Targum agrees, <p>"the congregation of Israel, when it did according to the law, was like to a vine, &amp;c.'' <p>planted by the waters; for in those hot countries vines required water, and thrived the better for bring near to them, or for being in watery places; this may denote the many privileges, blessings, laws, and ordinances, which were for the advantage of the Jewish people; both in their civil and ecclesiastical state: <p>she was fruitful and full of branches, by reason of many waters; grew populous, rich, and wealthy. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thy <span class="cverse3">{g}</span> mother <i>is</i> like a vine in thy blood, planted by the waters: she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many waters.</span><p>(g) He speaks this in the reproach of this wicked king, in whose blood, that is in the race of his predecessors, Jerusalem would have been blessed according to God's promise and flourished as a fruitful vine.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">10</span>. <span class="ital">is like a vine</span>] <span class="bld">was</span> like, in contrast to “but now she is planted in the wilderness” (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-13.htm" title="And now she is planted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty ground.">Ezekiel 19:13</a></span>).

LXX. read “on a pomegranate” (<span class="ital">brmn</span> for <span class="ital">bdmk</span>). Ew. suggests: “a vine of Carmel,” Ges. “a vine of thy vineyard;” Corn. as usual “zu streichen.” Others: “in thy likeness” “in thy thought,” “in thy rest”—all without sense. More tolerable: “in her height” (rumah), <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/19-11.htm" title="And she had strong rods for the scepters of them that bore rule, and her stature was exalted among the thick branches, and she appeared in her height with the multitude of her branches.">Ezekiel 19:11</a></span>.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">10–14</span>.

Now she is torn up and thrown down, carried into the wilderness, and planted in a dry and barren soil. A fire also has gone out from one of her strong rods which has consumed her. Her last prince, Zedekiah, has finally broken the state to pieces (cf. ch. 17).<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/19.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 10.</span> - Another parable comes close upon the heels of the first. <span class="cmt_word">Thy mother;</span> <span class="accented">sc</span>.

But as the prophet was not merely concerned with the correction of the error contained in the proverb which was current among the people, but still more with the rescue of the people themselves from destruction, he follows up the refutation with another earnest call to repentance. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>. If a wicked man turneth from his wickedness which he hath done, and doeth right and righteousness, he will keep his soul alive. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>. If he seeth and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall live and not die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>. And the house of Israel saith, The way of the Lord is not right. Are may ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not rather your ways that are not right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>. Therefore, every one according to his ways, will I judge you, O house of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Turn and repent of all your transgressions, that it may not become to you a stumbling-block to guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>. Cast from you all your transgressions which ye have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! And why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>. For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Therefore repent, that ye may live. - For the purpose of securing an entrance into their hearts for the call to repentance, the prophet not only repeats, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>, the truth declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>, that he who turns from his sin finds life, but refutes once more in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>, as he has already done in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, the charge that God's ways are not right. The fact that the singular &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; is connected with the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, does not warrant our altering the plural into &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, but may be explained in a very simple manner, by assuming that the ways of the people are all summed up in one, and that the meaning is this: what you say of my way applies to your own ways, - namely, "it is not right; there is just measure therein." &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, "therefore, etc.;" because my way, and not yours, is right, I will judge you, every one according to his way. Repent, therefore, if ye would escape from death and destruction. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is rendered more emphatic by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, sc. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>. In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be taken as the subject of the sentence according to the accents, but is a genitive dependent upon &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; and the subject is to be found in the preceding clause: that it (the sinning) may not become to you a stumbling-block of iniquity, i.e., a stumbling-block through which ye fall into guilt and punishment. - The appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a> points back to the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-18.htm">Ezekiel 11:18-19</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to cast away. The application of this word to transgressions may be explained from the fact that they consisted for the most part of idols and idolatrous images, which they had made. - "Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit:" a man cannot, indeed, create either of these by his own power; God alone can give them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). But a man both can and should come to God to receive them: in other words, he can turn to God, and let both heart and spirit be renewed by the Spirit of God. And this God is willing to do; for He has no pleasure &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;, in the death of the dying one. In the repetition of the assurance given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; is very appropriately substituted for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to indicate to the people that while in sin they are lying in death, and that it is only by conversion and renewal that they can recover life again. </body></html>
