He must compare the kings of Judah to a lion's whelps; they were cruel and oppressive to their own subjects. The righteousness of God is to be acknowledged, when those who have terrified and enslaved others, are themselves terrified and enslaved. When professors of religion form connexions with ungodly persons, their children usually grow up following after the maxims and fashions of a wicked world. Advancement to authority discovers the ambition and selfishness of men's hearts; and those who spend their lives in mischief, generally end them by violence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Another - Jehoiachin who soon showed himself no less unworthy than Jehoahaz.

But if the righteous man turn from his righteousness, and doeth wickedness, and acteth according to all the abominations which the ungodly man hath done, should he live? All the righteousness that he hath done shall not be remembered: for his unfaithfulness that he hath committed, and for his sin that he hath sinned, for these he shall die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>. And ye say, "The way of the Lord is not right." Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not right? Is it not your ways that are not right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-26.htm">Ezekiel 18:26</a>. If a righteous man turneth from his righteousness, and doeth wickedness, and dieth in consequence, he dieth for his wickedness that he hath done. - The proof that every one must bear his sin did not contain an exhaustive reply to the question, in what relation the righteousness of God stood to the sin of men? For the cases supposed in vv. 5-20 took for granted that there was a constant persistence in the course once taken, and overlooked the instances, which are by no means rare, when a man's course of life is entirely changed. It still remained, therefore, to take notice of such cases as these, and they are handled in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21-26</a>. The ungodly man, who repents and turns, shall live; and the righteous man, who turns to the way of sin, shall die. "As the righteous man, who was formerly a sinner, is not crushed down by his past sins; so the sinner, who was once a righteous man, is not supported by his early righteousness. Every one will be judged in that state in which he is found" (Jerome). The motive for the pardon of the repenting sinner is given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, in the declaration that God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked man, but desires his conversion, that he may live. God is therefore not only just, but merciful and gracious, and punishes none with death but those who either will not desist from evil, or will not persevere in the way of His commandments. Consequently the complaint, that the way of the Lord, i.e., His conduct toward men, is not weighed (&#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503;, see comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_samuel/2-3.htm">1 Samuel 2:3</a>), i.e., not just and right, is altogether unfounded, and recoils upon those who make it. It it not God's ways, but the sinner's, that are wrong (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>). The proof of this, which Hitzig overlooks, is contained in the declarations made in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-26.htm">Ezekiel 18:26</a>, - viz. in the fact that God does not desire the death of the sinner, and in His mercy forgives the penitent all his former sins, and does not lay them to his charge; and also in the fact that He punishes the man who turns from the way of righteousness and gives himself up to wickedness, on account of the sin which he commits; so that He simply judges him according to his deeds. - In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24</a>, &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1492; is the continuation of the infinitive &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, and &#1493;&#1495;&#1497; is interrogatory, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>. </body></html>
