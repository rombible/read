The righteousness of God is to be acknowledged, when those who have terrified and enslaved others, are themselves terrified and enslaved. When professors of religion form connexions with ungodly persons, their children usually grow up following after the maxims and fashions of a wicked world. Advancement to authority discovers the ambition and selfishness of men's hearts; and those who spend their lives in mischief, generally end them by violence.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/19.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The nations - are here the Chaldaeans: see the marginal references. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/19.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. in chains&#8212;(2Ch 36:6; Jer 22:18).

But as the prophet was not merely concerned with the correction of the error contained in the proverb which was current among the people, but still more with the rescue of the people themselves from destruction, he follows up the refutation with another earnest call to repentance. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>. If a wicked man turneth from his wickedness which he hath done, and doeth right and righteousness, he will keep his soul alive. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>. If he seeth and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall live and not die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>. And the house of Israel saith, The way of the Lord is not right. Are may ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not rather your ways that are not right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>. Therefore, every one according to his ways, will I judge you, O house of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Turn and repent of all your transgressions, that it may not become to you a stumbling-block to guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>. Cast from you all your transgressions which ye have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! And why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>. For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Therefore repent, that ye may live. - For the purpose of securing an entrance into their hearts for the call to repentance, the prophet not only repeats, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>, the truth declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>, that he who turns from his sin finds life, but refutes once more in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>, as he has already done in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, the charge that God's ways are not right. The fact that the singular &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; is connected with the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, does not warrant our altering the plural into &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, but may be explained in a very simple manner, by assuming that the ways of the people are all summed up in one, and that the meaning is this: what you say of my way applies to your own ways, - namely, "it is not right; there is just measure therein." &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, "therefore, etc.;" because my way, and not yours, is right, I will judge you, every one according to his way. Repent, therefore, if ye would escape from death and destruction. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is rendered more emphatic by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, sc. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>. In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be taken as the subject of the sentence according to the accents, but is a genitive dependent upon &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; and the subject is to be found in the preceding clause: that it (the sinning) may not become to you a stumbling-block of iniquity, i.e., a stumbling-block through which ye fall into guilt and punishment. - The appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a> points back to the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-18.htm">Ezekiel 11:18-19</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to cast away. The application of this word to transgressions may be explained from the fact that they consisted for the most part of idols and idolatrous images, which they had made. - "Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit:" a man cannot, indeed, create either of these by his own power; God alone can give them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). But a man both can and should come to God to receive them: in other words, he can turn to God, and let both heart and spirit be renewed by the Spirit of God. And this God is willing to do; for He has no pleasure &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;, in the death of the dying one. In the repetition of the assurance given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; is very appropriately substituted for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to indicate to the people that while in sin they are lying in death, and that it is only by conversion and renewal that they can recover life again. </body></html>
