This vine being turned into a degenerate plant of a strange vine; or the people of the Jews becoming wicked, disobedient to God, and disregarding his laws and ordinances, the wrath of God came upon them, and let in the Assyrians among them, who carried off ten tribes at once; and the tribes of Judah and Benjamin not taking warning hereby, but continuing and increasing in sinful courses, great part of them were carried captive into Babylon, with their king Jeconiah, who succeeded Jehoiakim before mentioned; when the kingdom seemed to be utterly ruined and destroyed, and is what is here referred to: <p>she was cast down to the ground; a phrase expressive of, he entire overthrow of the nation; for a vine, though plucked up, yet, if immediately planted again, might grow; but being plucked up, and left on the ground, and there lie, there is no hope of it; so that this denotes the desperate case of this people at this time, being in captivity. So the Targum paraphrases both clauses, <p>"and it was rooted up with strength out of the land of the house of the Shechinah, and translated into another land;'' <p>and the east wind dried up her fruit; Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and the Chaldean army, compared to an east wind, because hurtful and pernicious, as that is to trees and fruit, and because Babylon lay northeast of Judea; the people of, he land are meant by the fruit of the vine, with their wealth and riches, which were seized upon and wasted, or carried into Babylon. So the Targum, <p>"and a king strong as the east wind slew her people;'' <p>her strong rods were broken and withered; or, "strong rod"; the singular for the plural; which may design King Jeconiah particularly, who with his mother, wives, princes, and officers, and the mighty of the land, even all the mighty men of valour, with the craftsmen and smiths, were taken and carried captive, <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-14.htm">2 Kings 24:14</a>; <p>the fire consumed them; the wrath of God, which is often compared to fire, the same with fury in the beginning of the verse; which shows that it was for sin, which had provoked the Lord to wrath and anger, that all this ruin came upon the Jewish nation. The Targum is, <p>"her strong governors removed, and were carried captive; and the people which are strong, as fire consumed them.'' <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/19.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">But she was plucked up in fury, she was cast down to the ground, and the <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> east wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods were broken and withered; the fire consumed them.</span><p>(h) Meaning, that the Chaldeans would destroy them as the east wind does the fruit of the vine.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/19.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>.

But as the prophet was not merely concerned with the correction of the error contained in the proverb which was current among the people, but still more with the rescue of the people themselves from destruction, he follows up the refutation with another earnest call to repentance. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>. If a wicked man turneth from his wickedness which he hath done, and doeth right and righteousness, he will keep his soul alive. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>. If he seeth and turneth from all his transgressions which he hath committed, he shall live and not die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>. And the house of Israel saith, The way of the Lord is not right. Are may ways not right, O house of Israel? Is it not rather your ways that are not right? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>. Therefore, every one according to his ways, will I judge you, O house of Israel, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Turn and repent of all your transgressions, that it may not become to you a stumbling-block to guilt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a>. Cast from you all your transgressions which ye have committed, and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! And why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>. For I have no pleasure in the death of the dying, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. Therefore repent, that ye may live. - For the purpose of securing an entrance into their hearts for the call to repentance, the prophet not only repeats, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-28.htm">Ezekiel 18:28</a>, the truth declared in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>, that he who turns from his sin finds life, but refutes once more in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29</a>, as he has already done in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, the charge that God's ways are not right. The fact that the singular &#1497;&#1514;&#1468;&#1499;&#1503; is connected with the plural &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, does not warrant our altering the plural into &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1499;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501;, but may be explained in a very simple manner, by assuming that the ways of the people are all summed up in one, and that the meaning is this: what you say of my way applies to your own ways, - namely, "it is not right; there is just measure therein." &#1500;&#1499;&#1503;, "therefore, etc.;" because my way, and not yours, is right, I will judge you, every one according to his way. Repent, therefore, if ye would escape from death and destruction. &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; is rendered more emphatic by &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, sc. &#1508;&#1504;&#1497;&#1499;&#1501;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-6.htm">Ezekiel 14:6</a>. In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-30.htm">Ezekiel 18:30</a>, &#1506;&#1493;&#1503; is not to be taken as the subject of the sentence according to the accents, but is a genitive dependent upon &#1502;&#1499;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1500;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-19.htm">Ezekiel 7:19</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-3.htm">Ezekiel 14:3</a>; and the subject is to be found in the preceding clause: that it (the sinning) may not become to you a stumbling-block of iniquity, i.e., a stumbling-block through which ye fall into guilt and punishment. - The appeal in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-31.htm">Ezekiel 18:31</a> points back to the promise in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-18.htm">Ezekiel 11:18-19</a>. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500;&#1497;&#1498;, to cast away. The application of this word to transgressions may be explained from the fact that they consisted for the most part of idols and idolatrous images, which they had made. - "Make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit:" a man cannot, indeed, create either of these by his own power; God alone can give them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-19.htm">Ezekiel 11:19</a>). But a man both can and should come to God to receive them: in other words, he can turn to God, and let both heart and spirit be renewed by the Spirit of God. And this God is willing to do; for He has no pleasure &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1514;, in the death of the dying one. In the repetition of the assurance given in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1514; is very appropriately substituted for &#1512;&#1513;&#1473;&#1506;, to indicate to the people that while in sin they are lying in death, and that it is only by conversion and renewal that they can recover life again. </body></html>
