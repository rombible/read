But they were now as the refuse that is consumed in the furnace, or thrown away when the silver is refined. Sinners, especially backsliding professors, are, in God's account, useless and fit for nothing. When God brings his own people into the furnace, he sits by them as the refiner by his gold, to see that they are not continued there any longer than is fitting and needful. The dross shall be wholly separated, and the good metal purified. Let those who suffer pains, or lingering sickness, and find that their hearts can scarcely bear these light and momentary afflictions, take warning to flee from the wrath to come; for if these trials are not sanctified by the power of the Holy Spirit, to the cleansing their hearts and hands from sin, far worse things will come upon them.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/22.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Dross - A frequent metaphor which denotes not only the corruption of the people, who have become like base metal, but also a future purification whereby, the "dross" being burned away, the remnant of good may appear. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/22.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18. dross &#8230; brass&#8212;Israel has become a worthless compound of the dross of silver (implying not merely corruption, but degeneracy from good to bad, Isa 1:22, especially offensive) and of the baser metals. Hence the people must be thrown into the furnace of judgment, that the bad may be consumed, and the good separated (Jer 6:29, 30).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/22.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> No text from Poole on this verse. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/22.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Yea, I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath,....

Those near and those far off from thee shall ridicule thee as defiled in name, rich in confusion. - The expression '&#1492;&#1514;&#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1468;&#1496; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; proves this address to be a continuation of the reproof of Israel's sins, which commenced in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-4.htm">Ezekiel 20:4</a>. The epithet city of blood-guiltiness, as in Ezekiel E<a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/24-6.htm">Zechariah 24:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-9.htm">Ezekiel 24:9</a> (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/3-1.htm">Nahum 3:1</a>), is explained in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a>. The apodosis commences with &#1493;&#1492;&#1493;&#1491;&#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, and is continued in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-3.htm">Ezekiel 22:3</a> (&#1493;&#1488;&#1502;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;). &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488; &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, that her time, i.e., her time of punishment, may come: &#1506;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, like &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1493; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-30.htm">Ezekiel 21:30</a>. &#1493;&#1506;&#1513;&#1474;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; is not a continuation of the infinitive &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;, but of the participle &#1513;&#1473;&#1508;&#1499;&#1514;. &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;, of which different renderings have been given, does not mean "over itself," i.e., as a burden with which it has laden itself (Hvernick); still less "for itself" (Hitzig), a meaning which &#1506;&#1500; never has, but literally "upon," i.e., in itself, covering the city with it, as it were. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1497;, thou hast brought near, brought on thy days, that is to say, the days of judgment, and hast come to, arrived at thy years, sc. the years of visitation and punishment (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/11-23.htm">Jeremiah 11:23</a>). This meaning is readily supplied by the context. &#1496;&#1502;&#1488;&#1514; &#1492;, defiled, unclean with regard to the name, i.e., having forfeited the name of a holy city through capital crimes and other sinful abominations. &#1502;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468;&#1502;&#1492; is internal confusion, both moral and religious, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/3-9.htm">Amos 3:9</a> (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/55-10.htm">Psalm 55:10-12</a>).<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-12</a> there follows an enumeration of a multitude of sins which had been committed in Jerusalem. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>. Behold, the princes of Israel are every one, according to his arm, in thee to shed blood. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a>. Father and mother they despise in thee; toward the foreigner they act violently in the midst of thee; orphans and widows they oppress in thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a>. Thou despisest my holy things, and desecratest my Sabbaths. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>. Slanderers are in thee to shed blood, and they eat upon the mountains in thee; they practise lewdness in thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a>. They uncover the father's nakedness in thee; they ravish the defiled in her uncleanness in thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>. They take gifts in thee to shed blood; interest and usury thou takest, and overreachest thy neighbours with violence, and thou forgettest me, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah. - By the repetition of the refrain, to shed blood (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>), the enumeration is divided into three groups of sins, which are placed in the category of blood-guiltiness by the fact that they are preceded by this sentence and the repetition of it after the form of a refrain. the first group (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-6.htm">Ezekiel 22:6-8</a>) embraces sins which are committed in daring opposition to all the laws of morality. By the princes of Israel we are to understand primarily the profligate kings, who caused innocent persons to be put to death, such, for example, as Jehoiakim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/24-4.htm">2 Kings 24:4</a>), Manasseh (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/21-16.htm">2 Kings 21:16</a>), and others. The words &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;  are rendered by Hitzig and Kliefoth, they were ready to help one another; and in support of the rendering they appeal to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-9.htm">Psalm 83:9</a>. But in that case &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506;&#1493; would stand for &#1500;&#1494;&#1512;&#1506; &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; rof dnat, or rather for &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; &#1494;&#1512;&#1493;&#1506; &#1500;&#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;, - a substitution which cannot be sustained. Nor can they be taken in the sense proposed by Hvernick, every one relying upon his arm, i.e., looking to physical force alone, but simply every one according to his arm, i.e., according to his strength or violence, are they in thee. In this case &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; does not require anything to be supplied, any more than in the similar combination in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9</a>. Followed by &#1500;&#1502;&#1506;&#1503; with an infinitive, it means to be there with the intention of doing anything, or making an attempt, i.e., to direct his efforts to a certain end. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-7.htm">Ezekiel 22:7</a> it is not the princes who are the subject, but the ungodly in general. &#1492;&#1511;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; is the opposite of &#1499;&#1468;&#1489;&#1468;&#1491; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/20-12.htm">Exodus 20:12</a>). In the reproofs which follow, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/22-20.htm">Exodus 22:20</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-13.htm">Leviticus 19:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/24-14.htm">Deuteronomy 24:14</a>. With insolence and violence toward men there is associated contempt of all that is holy. For <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-8.htm">Ezekiel 22:8</a>, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-13.htm">Ezekiel 20:13</a>. - In the second group, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-9.htm">Ezekiel 22:9-11</a>, in addition to slander and idolatry, the crimes of lewdness and incest are the principal sins for which the people are reproved; and here the allusion to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18.htm">Leviticus 18</a> and 19 is very obvious. The reproof of slander also points back to the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-16.htm">Leviticus 19:16</a>. Slander to shed blood, refers to malicious charges and false testimony in a court of justice (vid., <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_kings/21-10.htm">1 Kings 21:10-11</a>). For eating upon the mountains, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-6.htm">Ezekiel 18:6</a>. The practice of zimma&#770;h is more specifically described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-10.htm">Ezekiel 22:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a>. For the thing itself, compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/18-7.htm">Leviticus 18:7-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-15.htm">Leviticus 19:15</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/19-9.htm">Leviticus 19:9</a>. The threefold &#1488;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-11.htm">Ezekiel 22:11</a> does not mean every one, but one, another, and the third, as the correlative &#1512;&#1506;&#1492;&#1493;&#1468; shows. - The third group, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/22-12.htm">Ezekiel 22:12</a>, is composed of sins of covetousness. For the first clause, compare the prohibition in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/23-2.htm">Exodus 23:2</a>; for the second, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-8.htm">Ezekiel 18:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-13.htm">Ezekiel 18:13</a>. The reproof finishes with forgetfulness of God, which is closely allied to covetousness.</body></html>
