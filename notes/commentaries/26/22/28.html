This serves to explain the fact that the only sins mentioned as exciting the wrath of God are covetousness and blood-guiltiness. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; , as <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/11-12.htm">2 Kings 11:12</a> clearly shows, is a contracted expression for &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a>), and the smiting of the hands together is a gesture indicative of wrathful indignation.
