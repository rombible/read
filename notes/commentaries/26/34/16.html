(See <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-15.htm" title="But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: you are waxen fat, you are grown thick, you are covered with fatness; then he forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.">Deuteronomy 32:15</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/28-27.htm" title="For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.">Acts 28:27</a>, &c.)<p><span class= "bld">With judgment.—</span>This does not mean, as the ambiguous sense of the English word might make it possible to suppose, <span class= "ital">with wisdom,</span> but with righteousness and authority, as is plainly seen from the connection with the following verses.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/34.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>34:7-16 The Lord declared that he intended mercy towards the scattered flock. Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With judgment - It is characteristic of Yahweh as a shepherd that He judges between sheep and sheep, rejecting the proud and accepting the penitent and broken-hearted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>16.

As all men are in Adam, and through his fall, and by their own actual transgressions; and so the elect of God among the rest; who are lost not with respect to God's knowledge of them, love to them, and care for them; but with respect to their knowledge of him, affection for him, and regard to his will, service, and glory; they are lost to themselves, they know not where they are, what is their state and condition, and how to get out of it; they cannot help themselves, nor can any other creature help them; and they see themselves to be in this lost and undone condition, when they are enlightened by the Spirit of God: but they are not irretrievably lost, for they are preserved in Christ Jesus; and he has been sent to seek and to save them; which he has done by redeeming them from sin, Satan, and the law; and, in the effectual calling, he goes after them, he sends his Gospel to them, and his Spirit unto them, and returns them to himself, the Shepherd and Bishop of souls; and whereas after this they go astray like lost sheep, he seeks and looks them up, and restores their souls, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/119-176.htm">Psalm 119:176</a>, <p>and bring again that which was driven away; through the power and prevalence of unbelief, from holding fast to the head Christ, departing at least partially from the living God; from dealing by faith with his precious person, blood, and righteousness; and from the precious promises, as not belonging to them, and refusing to be comforted by them; but the Lord brings back such again, and causes them to believe: Thomas is a notorious instance of this, <a href="http://biblehub.com/john/20-24.htm">John 20:24</a>, such also who are driven away through the force of Satan's temptations from the throne of grace; from the word and ordinances; and from private conversation with the saints, being hypocrites, as he suggests unto them; these the Lord brings back, by rebuking the tempter, and delivering out of his temptations: likewise such as are driven out of the right way of truth, and carried away with the error of the wicked, through the influence of bad pastors or false teachers, <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-1.htm">Jeremiah 23:1</a>, these will he restore again; for it is impossible the elect of God should be finally deceived: moreover, such as are driven away by the force of persecution, and scattered abroad, in God's due time have rest, and return to their folds again; see <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-17.htm">Jeremiah 50:17</a>, <p>and will bind up that which was broken; such who have broken hearts, broken with a sense of sin; made truly contrite by the Spirit and grace of God, through the word; which is a hammer to them, that breaks the rocky heart in pieces; to these the Lord has respect; their broken hearts are acceptable to him; he dwells with them, to revive them; he speaks and restores comforts to them; pours in oil and wine into their wounds, like the good Samaritan, and binds them up; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/147-3.htm">Psalm 147:3</a> and such who have broken bones, who have fallen into sin to the breaking of their bones, to the destroying of their peace, joy, and comfort, as David, Peter, and others have done; he sets their broken bones, and restores the joys of his salvation; and causes the bones which were broken to rejoice; at the discoveries of his pardoning grace and mercy, <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/51-8.htm">Psalm 51:8</a>, <p>and will strengthen that which was sick; sick through sin, as all men are; sick of sin, as sensible sinners be; sickly and weak, and ready to die, as fallen professors, backsliders, are; sick of love, through want of the discoveries of it; long after them; cannot be easy without them, as Christ's spouse sometimes is; and sick for want of food, faint and languid for want of spiritual refreshment; as the persons were Christ had compassion on, being as sheep without a shepherd, <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/9-36.htm">Matthew 9:36</a> each of these the Lord strengthens with the discoveries and applications of pardoning grace; with the flagons of his love, and apples of his promises; with the food of the Gospel, which strengthens men's hearts; and with grace out of his fulness, whereby they are strengthened against sin, snares, and temptations, and to exercise grace, and do the will of God: <p>but I will destroy the fat and the strong; that are full of themselves, lifted up with pride, conceited with their riches or righteousness, and despise others, whom they thrust with side and shoulder, and push with their horns, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-21.htm">Ezekiel 34:21</a>. So the Targum interprets it of wicked men, <p>"and I will consume the ungodly and sinners;'' <p>but the Septuagint, Vulgate Latin, Syriac, and Arabic versions, render it, "I will keep the fat and the strong"; in the plight and condition in which they are, and make them still stronger, and more fat and flourishing; so Jerom interprets it of saints and godly persons; and this agrees with the preceding clauses; only the original Hebrew text is against it, which does not admit of a various reading; and this rendering seems to arise in the Septuagint, the others follow, from the mistake of a similar letter: "I will feed them with judgment"; meaning either the whole flock, consisting of fat and lean cattle, making a distinction between them, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-17.htm">Ezekiel 34:17</a>, feeding them with discretion, and judging them according to their deserts; or else the fat and the strong ones, by inflicting righteous vengeance on them, feeding them with wormwood and gall; or his own people and sheep only.

The "fat and the strong," as contrasted with the "broken" and the "sick," are, when we interpret the Darable, the noble and wealthy who, under the kings of Judah, had been allowed to work their evil will upon the people. Of these he says that <span class="cmt_word">he will feed them with</span> (better, in) <span class="cmt_word">judgment</span>, that for them there must be the discipline of punishment.

The threat contained in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, of which Ezekiel had repeatedly reminded the people with warning, and, last of all, when predicting the conquest and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), had pressed heavily upon their heart, when the threatened judgment took place, so that they quote the words, not "in self-defence," as Hvernick erroneously supposes, but in despair of any deliverance. Ezekiel is to meet this despair of little faith by the announcement that the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but desires his conversion and his life. Ezekiel had already set this word of grave before the people in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, accompanied with the summons to salvation for them to lay to heart: there, it was done to overthrow the delusion that the present generation had to atone for the sins of the fathers; but here, to lift up the hearts of those who were despairing of salvation; and for this reason it is accompanied with the asseveration (wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>): "as truly as I live, saith the Lord," and with the urgent appeal to repent and turn. But in order to preclude the abuse of this word of consolation by making it a ground of false confidence in their own righteousness, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-20</a> the principal thoughts contained in that announcement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>) - namely, first of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-16</a>, the thought that the righteousness of the righteous is of no avail to him if he gives himself up to the unrighteousness, and that the sinner will not perish on account of his sin if he turns from his wickedness and strives after righteousness (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24-25</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>; and for <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>, more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>); and then, secondly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17-20</a>, the reproof of those who find fault with the way of the Lord (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29-30</a>). </body></html>
