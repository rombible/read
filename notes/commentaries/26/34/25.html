By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>One shepherd - One, as ruling over an undivided people, the distinction between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah having been done away.<p>My servant David - David was a fit type of the True King because he was a true and faithful servant of Yahweh.

The Septuagint and Arabic versions read, <p>"I will make with David a covenant of peace:'' <p>and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land; which was literally fulfilled when the Jews returned from Babylon; during their captivity, the land being uninhabited, evil beasts increased in it, and possessed it; but upon their return these ceased, being either destroyed, or driven away: but figuratively these design wicked men, who, for the malignity of their nature, manners, and conversation, are called evil beasts, as the Cretians were, <a href="http://biblehub.com/titus/1-12.htm">Titus 1:12</a>, particularly false teachers may be designed; those grievous wolves that spare not, but wrong the flock; but now shall be no more, being either forced to quit their place, or truly converted; so that the wolf shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard lie down with the kid; which will be the peaceable and comfortable state of the church in the latter day; when there will be none to hurt and destroy in the Lord's holy mountain, <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm">Isaiah 11:6</a>, <p>and they shall dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods; not only in their houses, but in the fields, and even in the wilderness, and in the woods, where wild beasts used to resort; but now being clear of all, and under the protection of such a Shepherd and Prince as David the servant of the Lord, they shall have no dread upon their mind, no fear of any danger; but dwell in the utmost security, lie down and sleep in peace and safety, the Lord sustaining them; and whom they shall serve without fear of any enemy all their days, in righteousness and holiness, being delivered out of the hands of them all. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">And I will make with them a covenant of peace, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they shall <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> dwell safely in the wilderness, and sleep in the woods.</span><p>(l) This declares that under Christ the flock would be truly delivered from sin and hell, and so be safely preserved in the Church where they would never perish.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">25</span>. <span class="ital">a covenant of peace</span>] a covenant securing everlasting peace and therefore implying the removal of all that would injure or disturb them. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm" title="I will even betroth you to me in faithfulness: and you shall know the LORD.">Hosea 2:20</a> the sense is somewhat different: Jehovah makes a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, that they shall not hurt. In Hos. “beasts” is used literally (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-6.htm" title="The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the fatted calf together; and a little child shall lead them.">Isaiah 11:6</a>), here figuratively, meaning foes, heathen assailants, though the figure of the flock is still maintained (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm" title="And I will give peace in the land, and you shall lie down, and none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.">Leviticus 26:6</a>). The “wilderness” is the uncultivated pasture land as distinguished from that under tillage, covered with crops or fruit-trees (Carmel). Even in the “woods,” the parts covered with bush, the haunts of wild beasts, the flock shall sleep safely.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/34.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 25.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">I will make with them a servant of peace</span>. The whole verse is an echo of <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-6.htm">Leviticus 26:6</a>, in part also of <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/2-20.htm">Hosea 2:20</a> [English version, ver. 18]. The words are less definite as to the nature of the covenant than those of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/31-31.htm">Jeremiah 31:31</a>, but probably the same thought underlies both. Sins are pardoned, the capacity for righteousness, righteousness itself, are given. In bright contrast with the picture of a country haunted by the lion, the jackal, and the wolf - the "evil beasts" of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-15.htm">Ezekiel 14:15</a> - so that no man could pass through without risk, we have that of a land from which such evil boasts have been cleared out, so that men may sleep safely even in the <span class="cmt_word">wilderness and the woods</span>. The language, however, is figurative rather than literal. As the "sheep" are the people of the true Israel, so the evil beasts must, at least, include the enemies, Chaldeans, Edomites, Philistines, and others, that had before made havoc of them. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/33.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Tidings of the Fall of Jerusalem, and the Consequences with Regard to the Prophet<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a>. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth (month), on the fifth of the month after our being taken captive, there came to me a fugitive from Jerusalem, and said, The city is smitten. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>. And the hand of Jehovah had come upon me in the evening before the arrival of the fugitive, and He opened my mouth, till he came to me in the morning; and so was my mouth opened, and I was silent no more. - In these verses the fulfilment of the promise made by God to the prophet in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25-27</a>, after the prediction of the destruction of Jerusalem, is recorded. The chronological datum, as to the precise time at which the messenger arrived with the account of the destruction of Jerusalem, serves to mark with precision the point of time at which the obstacle was removed, and the prophet was able to speak and prophesy without restraint. - The fact that the tidings of the destruction of Jerusalem, which took place in the fifth month of the eleventh year, are said to have only reached the exiles in the tenth month of the twelfth year, that is to say, nearly a year and a half after it occurred, does not warrant our following the Syriac, as Doederlein and Hitzig have done, calling in question the correctness of the text and substituting the eleventh year for the twelfth. With the distance at which Ezekiel was living, namely, in northern Mesopotamia, and with the fearful confusion which followed the catastrophe, a year and a half might very easily pass by before a fugitive arrived with the information. But Hitzig's assertion, that Ezekiel would contradict himself, inasmuch as, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-1.htm">Ezekiel 26:1-2</a>, he received intelligence of the affair in the eleventh year, is founded upon a misinterpretation of the passage quoted. It is not stated there that Ezekiel received this information through a fugitive or any man whatever, but simply that God had revealed to him the fall of Jerusalem even before it occurred. &#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, after our being led away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/40-1.htm">Ezekiel 40:1</a>), coincides with &#1500;&#1490;&#1500;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1500;&#1498; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-2.htm">Ezekiel 1:2</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1514;&#1492;, smitten, i.e., conquered and destroyed, exterminated. In the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1491; &#1497;&#1492;&#1493;&#1492; , the verb &#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492; is a pluperfect, and &#1488;&#1500;&#1497; stands for &#1506;&#1500;&#1497;, according to the later usage. The formula indicates the translation of the prophet into an ecstatic state (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/1-3.htm">Ezekiel 1:3</a>), in which his mouth was opened to speak, that is to say, the silence imposed upon him was taken away. The words, "till he came to me in the morning," etc., are not to be understood as signifying that the prophet's mouth had only been opened for the time from evening till morning; for this would be opposed to the following sentence. They simply affirm that the opening of the mouth took place before the arrival of the fugitive, the night before the morning of his arrival. &#1493;&#1497;&#1468;&#1508;&#1468;&#1514;&#1495; &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;, which follows, is an emphatic repetition, introduced as a link with which to connect the practically important statement that from that time forward he was not speechless any more. - It was in all probability shortly afterwards that Ezekiel was inspired with the word of God which follows in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-23.htm">Ezekiel 33:23-33</a>, as we may infer from the contents of the word itself, which laid the foundation for the prophet's further prophesying. But nothing can be gathered from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a> with regard to the time when this and the following words of God (as far as <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/39.htm">Ezekiel 39</a>), of which no chronological data are given, were communicated to the prophet and uttered by him. His being "silent no more" by no means involves immediate or continuous speaking, but simply recalls the command to be speechless. There is no ground for the assumption that all these words of God were communicated to him in one night (Hvernick, Hengstenberg, and others), either in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a> or in the contents of these divine revelations. </body></html>
