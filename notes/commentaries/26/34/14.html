Doubtless this, in the first place, had reference to the restoration of the Jews. It also represented the good Shepherd's tender care of the souls of his people. He finds them in their days of darkness and ignorance, and brings them to his fold. He comes to their relief in times of persecution and temptation. He leads them in the ways of righteousness, and causes them to rest on his love and faithfulness. The proud and self-sufficient, are enemies of the true gospel and of believers; against such we must guard. He has rest for disquieted saints, and terror for presumptuous sinners.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The cloudy and dark day - Contrasted with the day in which the Lord will be among them like a shepherd to gather them together again. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>14. good pasture&#8212;(Ps 23:2).<p>high mountains of Israel&#8212;In Eze 17:23; 20:40, the phrase is "the mountain of the height of Israel" in the singular number.

Or with good food, as the Targum: such as the fulness of grace in Christ, where believers go in and out, and find pasture; and where they may feed to the full, have bread enough, and to spare; and may draw water with joy out of the full wells of salvation: this is good food; food indeed, in opposition to that which was typical, or is imaginary; this is spiritual food, suitable to the spirits of men, brought by the Spirit of God, and relished by a spiritual man; this is savoury food, soul satisfying and soul strengthening food; this is nourishing food, and what will endure to everlasting life: and such is the Gospel, the promises and doctrines of it, in which there is a variety of food; milk for babes, and meat for strong men; sweet to the taste, and health to the bones; salutary and nourishing, and which makes glad the heart; and of the same kind are the ordinances of the Gospel, the breasts of consolation, the goodness and fatness of the Lord's house; which he makes his people partakers of, and satisfies them with. <p>And upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be; there shall they lie in a good fold; of the same nature and use are the churches of Christ as a fold is to the sheep; as that they are separated, divided, and distinguished from others; as into a fold, the sheep of Christ are gathered into churches; where they lie together, are united and knit together in love, and where they have communion with one another, and keep each other warm, and stir up one another to love and good works; whereby the vitals of religion are preserved; here they are kept in the night season, and fed in the winter; these like a fold are a sort of fence unto them, and a preservation of them from wolves and bears; and here they lie down, and have spiritual rest, ease, and safety: and as in a fold there are lambs, and sheep, and goats, so in churches there are different sorts folded together, weaker and stronger Christians; and some only nominal ones, who will be separated at the last day. A fold may be taken down, and removed from place to place, and so may visible congregated churches; the candlestick may be removed out of its place, the word and ordinances; and so a Gospel church state may be carried from place to place; and there is but one fold for Jews and Gentiles, and this is a good one; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/john/10-16.htm">John 10:16</a>. <p>And in a fat pasture shall they feed on the mountains of Israel; on the feast of fat things there, and so become fat and flourishing; See Gill on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-13.htm">Ezekiel 34:13</a>. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">I will feed them in a good pasture, and upon the high mountains of Israel shall their fold be: there shall they lie in a good fold, and in a fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>.

Thou then, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Ye rightly say, Our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and in them we vanish away; how, then, can we live? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. Say to them, As   truly as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the sinner; but when the sinner turneth from his way, he shall live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways! for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>. And thou, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and the sinner will not fall through his sin in the day that he turneth from his sin, and the righteous man will not be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-13.htm">Ezekiel 33:13</a>. If I say to the righteous man that he shall live, and he relies upon his righteousness and does wrong, all his righteousnesses will not be remembered; and for his wrong that he has done, he will die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a>. If I say to the sinner, Thou shalt die, and he turns from his sin, and does justice and righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>. So that the wicked returns the pledge, restores what has been robbed, walks in the statutes of life without doing wrong, he will live, not die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>. All his sins which he has committed shall not be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness, he will live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>. And the sons of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not right; but they - their way is not right. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-18.htm">Ezekiel 33:18</a>. If the righteous man turneth from his righteousness and doeth wrong, he shall die thereby; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-19.htm">Ezekiel 33:19</a>. But if the wicked man turneth from his wickedness and doeth right and righteousness, he will live thereby. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-20.htm">Ezekiel 33:20</a>. And yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not right. I will judge you every one according to his ways, O house of Israel. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a> the prophet's calling for the future is set before him, inasmuch as God instructs him to announce to those who are in despair on account of their sins the gracious will of the Lord. The threat contained in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, of which Ezekiel had repeatedly reminded the people with warning, and, last of all, when predicting the conquest and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), had pressed heavily upon their heart, when the threatened judgment took place, so that they quote the words, not "in self-defence," as Hvernick erroneously supposes, but in despair of any deliverance. Ezekiel is to meet this despair of little faith by the announcement that the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but desires his conversion and his life. Ezekiel had already set this word of grave before the people in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, accompanied with the summons to salvation for them to lay to heart: there, it was done to overthrow the delusion that the present generation had to atone for the sins of the fathers; but here, to lift up the hearts of those who were despairing of salvation; and for this reason it is accompanied with the asseveration (wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>): "as truly as I live, saith the Lord," and with the urgent appeal to repent and turn. But in order to preclude the abuse of this word of consolation by making it a ground of false confidence in their own righteousness, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-20</a> the principal thoughts contained in that announcement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>) - namely, first of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-16</a>, the thought that the righteousness of the righteous is of no avail to him if he gives himself up to the unrighteousness, and that the sinner will not perish on account of his sin if he turns from his wickedness and strives after righteousness (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24-25</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>; and for <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>, more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>); and then, secondly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17-20</a>, the reproof of those who find fault with the way of the Lord (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29-30</a>). </body></html>
