By good pastures and deep waters, are meant the pure word of God and the dispensing of justice. The latter verses, 23-31, prophesy of Christ, and of the most glorious times of his church on earth. Under Him, as the good Shepherd, the church would be a blessing to all around. Christ, though excellent in himself, was as a tender plant out of a dry ground. Being the Tree of life, bearing all the fruits of salvation, he yields spiritual food to the souls of his people. Our constant desire and prayer should be, that there may be showers of blessings in every place where the truth of Christ is preached; and that all who profess the gospel may be filled with fruits of righteousness.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/34.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>With judgment - It is characteristic of Yahweh as a shepherd that He judges between sheep and sheep, rejecting the proud and accepting the penitent and broken-hearted. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/34.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>18, 19.

When you are full fed, and others hungry and ready to starve, who might live on that you leave if you did not spoil it, do you think such killing is no crime? Is it not a very great cruelty, and a most barbarous inhumanity? You great ones, who have much more than others, partly by the bounty of the Lord of the sheep, and partly by your injustice and rapine, you eat the fat and sweet, and what you cannot eat you waste and spoil; and what would you say, if your proud, fat, and spiteful servants in your houses should do so to their weaker, leaner, and modester servants? <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The deep waters; </span> which are clear to the eye and pleasant, which are sweet to their palate, which are wholesome to the drinker. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Ye must foul the residue with your feet; </span> in spite as much as wantonness you stamp in them, raise all the mud from the bottom, that makes the waters unfit to be drunk: is this a trivial thing thus to starve and choke those you should feed and refresh? Such hath been the carriage of you rich, powerful, ruling, and governing part of my people, who have been forced either to live on what you made unwholesome and noxious, or to starve at home, or seek somewhat abroad; this hath destroyed many and dispersed more, but I will not always wink at and bear this. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/34.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Seemeth it a small thing unto you to have eaten up the good pasture,.... This is directed to the rams and he goats, to the people of power and wealth, or who had the key of knowledge and instruction; who, by their conduct, showed as if it was not enough for them to eat and drink the best of things themselves, to enjoy their wealth and riches, and keep their posts of honour and profit, and the revenues of them, in church and state: <p>but ye must tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures? and to have drunk of the deep waters, but ye must foul the residue with your feet? but they must oppress the poor, by taking away from them that little they have; or by making their lives uncomfortable to them, by their severities and exactions; so that that small pittance they had, they cannot enjoy with any pleasure, The allusion is to beasts in pasture, which tread down and put dung what they do not eat, which makes what is left unfit for others; and to cattle, at ponds of water, which having drank, foul the rest with their feet; as camels particularly are said to do; so that others cannot drink after them, at least not so agreeably: this may be applied to the Scribes and Pharisees, and such as they were, who devoured widows' houses, and made void the word and commandments of God, by their traditions; teaching for doctrines the commandments of men; and so polluted the pure waters of the sanctuary; defiled the Scriptures of truth, and delivered out such doctrines as were not food and drink to the souls of men, and yet were obliged to receive them; and such are heretical persons, who sometimes arise out of the churches, are a part of the flock, that corrupt the word of God, pervert the Scriptures, and handle them deceitfully; and may be said to tread down and trample upon the wholesome truths of the Gospel, and to muddy the clear doctrines of grace; so that the children of God cannot, as they desire, have the pure, unmixed, sincere milk of the word. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/34.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><i>Seemeth it</i> a small thing to you to have eaten up the good <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> pasture, but ye must tread down with your feet the rest of your pastures? and to have drank of the deep waters, but ye must foul the rest with your feet?</span><p>(i) By good pasture and deep waters is meant the pure word of God and the administration of justice which they did not distribute to the poor till they had corrupted it.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/34.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">18</span>.

Thou then, son of man, say to the house of Israel, Ye rightly say, Our transgressions and our sins lie upon us, and in them we vanish away; how, then, can we live? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a>. Say to them, As   truly as I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, I have no pleasure in the death of the sinner; but when the sinner turneth from his way, he shall live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways! for why will ye die, O house of Israel? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>. And thou, son of man, say to the sons of thy people, The righteousness of the righteous man will not deliver him in the day of his transgression, and the sinner will not fall through his sin in the day that he turneth from his sin, and the righteous man will not be able to live thereby in the day that he sinneth. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-13.htm">Ezekiel 33:13</a>. If I say to the righteous man that he shall live, and he relies upon his righteousness and does wrong, all his righteousnesses will not be remembered; and for his wrong that he has done, he will die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a>. If I say to the sinner, Thou shalt die, and he turns from his sin, and does justice and righteousness, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>. So that the wicked returns the pledge, restores what has been robbed, walks in the statutes of life without doing wrong, he will live, not die. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-16.htm">Ezekiel 33:16</a>. All his sins which he has committed shall not be remembered against him; he has done justice and righteousness, he will live. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17</a>. And the sons of thy people say, The way of the Lord is not right; but they - their way is not right. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-18.htm">Ezekiel 33:18</a>. If the righteous man turneth from his righteousness and doeth wrong, he shall die thereby; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-19.htm">Ezekiel 33:19</a>. But if the wicked man turneth from his wickedness and doeth right and righteousness, he will live thereby. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-20.htm">Ezekiel 33:20</a>. And yet ye say, The way of the Lord is not right. I will judge you every one according to his ways, O house of Israel. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-10.htm">Ezekiel 33:10</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-11.htm">Ezekiel 33:11</a> the prophet's calling for the future is set before him, inasmuch as God instructs him to announce to those who are in despair on account of their sins the gracious will of the Lord. The threat contained in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>), &#1497;&#1502;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468; &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1501;, of which Ezekiel had repeatedly reminded the people with warning, and, last of all, when predicting the conquest and destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>), had pressed heavily upon their heart, when the threatened judgment took place, so that they quote the words, not "in self-defence," as Hvernick erroneously supposes, but in despair of any deliverance. Ezekiel is to meet this despair of little faith by the announcement that the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but desires his conversion and his life. Ezekiel had already set this word of grave before the people in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>, accompanied with the summons to salvation for them to lay to heart: there, it was done to overthrow the delusion that the present generation had to atone for the sins of the fathers; but here, to lift up the hearts of those who were despairing of salvation; and for this reason it is accompanied with the asseveration (wanting in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-23.htm">Ezekiel 18:23</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-32.htm">Ezekiel 18:32</a>): "as truly as I live, saith the Lord," and with the urgent appeal to repent and turn. But in order to preclude the abuse of this word of consolation by making it a ground of false confidence in their own righteousness, Ezekiel repeats in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-20</a> the principal thoughts contained in that announcement (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-20.htm">Ezekiel 18:20-32</a>) - namely, first of all, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12-16</a>, the thought that the righteousness of the righteous is of no avail to him if he gives himself up to the unrighteousness, and that the sinner will not perish on account of his sin if he turns from his wickedness and strives after righteousness (&#1497;&#1499;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1500; , <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-12.htm">Ezekiel 33:12</a>, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/5-5.htm">Hosea 5:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-15.htm">Jeremiah 6:15</a>; compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-24.htm">Ezekiel 18:24-25</a>, and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-21.htm">Ezekiel 18:21</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-22.htm">Ezekiel 18:22</a>; and for <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-14.htm">Ezekiel 33:14</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-15.htm">Ezekiel 33:15</a>, more especially <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-5.htm">Ezekiel 18:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-7.htm">Ezekiel 18:7</a>); and then, secondly, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-17.htm">Ezekiel 33:17-20</a>, the reproof of those who find fault with the way of the Lord (compare <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-25.htm">Ezekiel 18:25</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-27.htm">Ezekiel 18:27</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/18-29.htm">Ezekiel 18:29-30</a>). </body></html>
