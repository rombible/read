Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind!

The Egyptians themselves, or rather they that are after mentioned. The Targum is, <p>"the prophet said, a lamentation is this prophecy, and it shall be for a lamentation;'' <p>he was bid at the beginning of it to take up a lamentation, and now at the end of it he pronounces it to be one, and that it should be sung as such: <p>the daughters of the nations shall lament for her; either literally understood, it being the business and custom of women to say or sing the funeral dirge, or the lamentation at the interment of the deceased; or figuratively, the inhabitants of other nations. So Ben Melech and the Targum, <p>"the villages of the people shall lament her''; <p>that is, the inhabitants of them, who were in alliance with Egypt, and under its protection: <p>they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude; for the desolation of the land, and for the vast numbers of people that should be slain with the sword, or carried captive: <p>saith the Lord God; which is added for the confirmation of it; for what he has spoken shall be done. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/32.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">This is the lamentation wherewith they shall lament her: the daughters of the nations shall lament her: they shall lament for her, even for Egypt, and for all her multitude, saith the Lord GOD.</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/32.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">16</span>.

And I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them in the lands, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-24.htm">Ezekiel 30:24</a>.

I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharaoh will fall; and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I give my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, that he may stretch it against the land of Egypt. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a>. I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, and disperse them in the lands; and they shall know that I am Jehovah. - The perfect &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> is not a prophetic utterance of the certainty of the future, but a pure preterite. This may be seen "both from the allusion in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> to the condition resulting from the shbr &#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1512;, and also to the obviously antithetical relation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>, in which future events are predicted" (Hitzig). The arm is a figurative expression for power, here for military power, as it wields the sword. God broke the arm of Pharaoh by the defeat which the Chaldeans inflicted upon Pharaoh Hophra, when he was marching to the relief of besieged Jerusalem. &#1495;&#1489;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1492; is a present, as is apparent from the infinitive clauses ('&#1500;&#1514;&#1514; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;) which follow, altogether apart from &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492;; and &#1495;&#1489;&#1513;&#1473; signifies to bind up, for the purpose of healing a broken limb, that remedies may be applied and a bandage put on. &#1500;&#1495;&#1494;&#1511;&#1492;&#1468;, that it may become strong or sound, is subordinate to the preceding clause, and governs the infinitive which follows. The fact that the further judgment which is to fall upon Pharaoh is introduced with &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; (therefore) here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-22.htm">Ezekiel 30:22</a>), notwithstanding the fact that it has not been preceded by any enumeration of the guilt which occasioned it, may be accounted for on the ground that the causal &#1500;&#1499;&#1503; forms a link with the concluding clause of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-21.htm">Ezekiel 30:21</a> : the arm shall not be healed, so as to be able to grasp or hold the sword. Because Pharaoh is not to attain any more to victorious power, therefore God will shatter both of his arms, the strong, i.e., the sound one and the broken one, that is to say, will smite it so completely, that the sword will fall from his hand. The Egyptians are to be scattered among the nations, as is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-23.htm">Ezekiel 30:23</a> verbatim from <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/29-12.htm">Ezekiel 29:12</a>. God will give the sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and equip and strengthen him to destroy the might of Pharaoh, that the latter may groan before him like one who is pierced with the sword. This thought is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-25.htm">Ezekiel 30:25</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-26.htm">Ezekiel 30:26</a> with an intimation of the purpose of this divine procedure. That purpose it: that men may come to recognise Jehovah as God the Lord. The subject to &#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; is indefinite; and the rendering of the lxx is a very good one, &#x3ba;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;&#768; &#x3b3;&#x3bd;&#x3c9;&#769;&#x3c3;&#x3bf;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; &#x3c0;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3bd;&#x3c4;&#x3b5;&#x3c2;. </body></html>
