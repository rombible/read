Great oppressors are, in God's account, no better than beasts of prey. Those who admire the pomp of this world, will wonder at the ruin of that pomp; which to those who know the vanity of all things here below, is no surprise. When others are ruined by sin, we have to fear, knowing ourselves guilty. The instruments of the desolation are formidable. And the instances of the desolation are frightful. The waters of Egypt shall run like oil, which signifies there should be universal sadness and heaviness upon the whole nation. God can soon empty those of this world's goods who have the greatest fulness of them. By enlarging the matters of our joy, we increase the occasions of our sorrow. How weak and helpless, as to God, are the most powerful of mankind!

It was situated on the eastern arm of the Nile, to which it gave its name, at a distance of twenty stadia from the sea. The Egyptian name Pehromi also signifies dirty, or muddy. From this the Arabs have made Elfarama; and in the vicinity of the few ruins of the ancient Pelusium there is still a castle called Arab. t, Tineh (compare the Chaldee &#1496;&#1497;&#1504;&#1488;, clay, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/daniel/2-41.htm">Daniel 2:41</a>). Ezekiel calls it the "fortress or bulwark of Egypt," because, as Strabo (l.c.) observes, "Egypt is difficult of access here from places in the East;" for which reason Hirtius (de bell. Al. c. 27) calls it "the key of Egypt," and Suidas (s.v.) "the key both of the entrance and exit of Egypt." On the history of this city, see Leyrer in Herzog's Encyclopaedia. In &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; &#1504;&#1488; many of the commentators find a play upon the name of the god &#1488;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/46-25.htm">Jeremiah 46:25</a>), the chief deity of Thebes, which is possible, but not very probable, as we should not expect to find a god mentioned again here after <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-13.htm">Ezekiel 30:13</a>; and &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497; would be inappropriate. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-16.htm">Ezekiel 30:16</a> Sin ( equals  Pelusium) is mentioned again as the border fortress, No ( equals  Memphis) as the capital of Upper Egypt, as all falling within the range of the judgment. The expression &#1504;&#1507; &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; has caused some difficulty and given occasion to various conjectures, none of which, however, commend themselves as either simple or natural explanations.<p>(Note: Ewald proposes to alter &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; into &#1510;&#1491;&#1497; (after the Aramaean), "rust," and renders it: "Memphis will be eternal rust." But to this Hitzig has very properly objected that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-6.htm">Ezekiel 24:6</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-11.htm">Ezekiel 24:11</a>, rust is called &#1495;&#1500;&#1488;&#1492;; and that even in <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/6-3.htm">Psalm 6:3</a> &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; does not mean perpetual or eternal. Hvernick proposes to explain &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501;, from the Aramaean zer', to rend or tear in pieces, "Memphis shall become perpetual rents." To this also it may be objected, that &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in Hebrew has the standing meaning of oppressors; and that &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501;, interdiu, is not equivalent to perpetual; and still further, that the preposition &#1500; could not be omitted before &#1510;&#1512;&#1497;.)<p>As Hitzig has correctly observed, &#1510;&#1512;&#1497; &#1497;&#1493;&#1502;&#1501; is the same as &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1510;&#1468;&#1492;&#1512;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-8.htm">Jeremiah 15:8</a>, and is the opposite of &#1513;&#1473;&#1491;&#1491;&#1497; &#1500;&#1497;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/obadiah/1-5.htm">Obadiah 1:5</a>. The enemy who comes by day, not in the night, is the enemy who does not shun open attack. The connection with &#1504;&#1507; is to be explained by the same rule as <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/24-2.htm">Jeremiah 24:2</a>, "the one basket - very good figs." Memphis will have enemies in broad daylight, i.e., will be filled with them. &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;  equals   &#1488;&#1493;&#1503;, &#1488;&#1503;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-50.htm">Genesis 41:50</a> (Egyptian An, or Anu), is the popular name of Heliopolis in Lower Egypt (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>); and the form &#1488;&#1493;&#1503; (a vain thing, or idol) is probably selected intentionally in the sense of an idol-city (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-15.htm">Hosea 4:15</a>), because On-Heliopolis (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-13.htm">Jeremiah 43:13</a>) was from time immemorial one of the principal seats of the Egyptian worship of the sun, and possessed a celebrated temple of the sun, with a numerous and learned priesthood (see the comm. on <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/41-45.htm">Genesis 41:45</a>, ed. 2). &#1508;&#1468;&#1497;&#1470;&#1489;&#1505;&#1514;, i.e., &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3bf;&#769;&#x3c2; (lxx), or &#x3b2;&#x3bf;&#x3c5;&#x3b2;&#x3b1;&#x3c3;&#x3c4;&#x3b9;&#769;&#x3bd; (Herod. ii. 59), Egyptian Pi-Pasht, i.e., the place of Pasht, so called from the cat-headed Bubastis or Pasht, the Egyptian Diana, which was worshipped there in a splendid temple. It was situated on the royal canal leading to Suez, which was begun by Necho and finished under Ptolemy II, not far from its junction with the Pelusiac arm of the Nile. It was the chief seat of the Nomos Bubastites, was destroyed by the Persians, who demolished its walls (Diod. Sic. xvi. 51), and has entirely disappeared, with the exception of some heaps of ruins which still bear the name of Tel Bastah, about seven hours' journey from the Nile (compare Ges. Thes. pp. 1101ff., and Leyrer in Herzog's Encyclopaedia, s.v.). The Nomos of Bubastis, according to Herod. ii. 166, was assigned to the warrior-caste of Calasirians.

This explanation of &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1492; is commended by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>. &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1508;&#1504;&#1495;&#1505; or &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1495;&#1505; (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/46-14.htm">Ezekiel 46:14</a>), and &#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1508;&#1504;&#1505; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-16.htm">Jeremiah 2:16</a> (Chetib), is &#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9;, &#x3a4;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b7; (lxx), or &#x394;&#x3b1;&#769;&#x3c6;&#x3bd;&#x3b1;&#x3b9; (Herod. ii. 30. 107), a frontier city of Egypt in the vicinity of Pelusium, after the time of Psammetichus a fortification with a strong garrison, where a palace of Pharaoh was also to be found, according to <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>. After the destruction of Jerusalem, a portion of the Jews took refuge there, and to them Jeremiah predicted the punishment of God on the conquest of Egypt by Nebuchadnezzar (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-7.htm">Jeremiah 43:7</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/44-1.htm">Ezekiel 44:1</a>.). In the case of &#1492;&#1513;&#1498; the reading varies; the printed Masora at <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/39-3.htm">Genesis 39:3</a> giving &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; as the reading to be found in all the codices examined by the author of the Masora; whereas many of the codices and printed editions have &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;, and this is adopted in all the ancient versions. This is evidently the correct reading, as &#1495;&#1513;&#1474;&#1498; does not furnish an appropriate meaning, and the parallel passages, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-8.htm">Ezekiel 32:8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/8-9.htm">Amos 8:9</a>, all favour &#1495;&#1513;&#1473;&#1498;. The darkening of the day is the phenomenal prognostic of the dawning of the great day of judgment upon the nations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/2-10.htm">Joel 2:10</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/joel/3-4.htm">Joel 3:4</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/joel/3-15.htm">Joel 3:15</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/13-10.htm">Isaiah 13:10</a>, etc.). This day is to dawn upon Egypt at Tachpanches, the border fortress of the land towards Syria and Palestine, when the Lord will break the yokes of Egypt. These words point back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-13.htm">Leviticus 26:13</a>, where the deliverance of Israel from the bondage of Egypt is called the breaking in pieces of its yokes (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-27.htm">Ezekiel 34:27</a>). That which took place then is to be repeated here. The yokes which Egypt put upon the nations are to be broken; and all the proud might of that kingdom is to be brought to an end (&#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1492;&#1468;, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-6.htm">Ezekiel 30:6</a>). In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-18.htm">Ezekiel 30:18</a>, &#1492;&#1497;&#1488;, which stands at the head in an absolute form, points back to &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1495;&#1508;&#1504;&#1495;&#1505;. The city (Daphne) will be covered with cloud, i.e., will be overthrown by the judgment; and her daughters, i.e., the smaller cities and hamlets dependent upon her (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-46.htm">Ezekiel 16:46</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-6.htm">Ezekiel 26:6</a>), will go into captivity in the persons of their inhabitants. It follows from this that Daphne was the chief city of a Nomos in Lower Egypt; and this is confirmed by the circumstance that there was a royal palace there. If we compare the threat in this verse, that in Tachpanches an end is to be put to the proud might of Pharaoh, with the threatening words of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-9.htm">Jeremiah 43:9</a>., to the effect that Nebuchadnezzar would set up his throne at Tachpanches and smite Egypt, it is evident that the situation of Daphne must at that time have been such that the war between Egypt and Babylonia would necessarily be decided in or near this city. These prophetic utterances cannot be explained, as Kliefoth supposes, from the fact that many Jews had settled in Daphne; nor do the contents of this verse furnish any proof that Ezekiel did not utter this prophecy of his till after the Jews had settled there (<a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/43-1.htm">Jeremiah 43:1-13</a> and 44). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/30-19.htm">Ezekiel 30:19</a> serves to round off the prophecy. </body></html>
