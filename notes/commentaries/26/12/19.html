Of Chaldea, where the prophet now was; not the natives of the land, but the Israelites, who were captives in it; who were ready to murmur and repine at their own case, as miserable; and at that of the Jews at Jerusalem, as happy; and therefore they are taught by this sign, as well as by the following prophecy, that they were mistaken: <p>thus saith the Lord God of the inhabitants of Jerusalem; or to them, or "concerning" them (y); whom the captives in Chaldea thought lived so happily, and would continue so: <p>and of the land of Israel; or, "upon the land of Israel" (z); inhabitants on it; to this sense the Targum and Septuagint Version interpret it, and also Kimchi: <p>they shall eat their bread with carefulness, and drink their water with astonishment; meaning at the siege of Jerusalem, when they could not eat and drink in peace; but, while they were eating and drinking, were disturbed and put into fear and surprise by the besiegers; and also, hearing that their provisions would not hold out, were careful how they ate and drank, and were frightened with the thoughts of being reduced to extreme want: <p>that her land may be desolate from all that is therein; or, "from its fulness" (a); men and cattle, cities, towns, houses, vineyards, fields, fruits, and plenty of all good things. Jarchi expounds it of riches: <p>because of the violence of all them that dwell therein; not the violence of the Chaldeans, making a prey of all they met with, plundering cities and towns, and making forage of the fruits of the earth, by which means the land was desolate; but the rapine, oppression, and injustice of the Jews, which were the cause of all these calamities which came upon their country. <p>(y)  "habitatoribus Hierosolymorum", Montanus, Starckius; "de habitatoribus", Piscator; "de habitantibus Hierosolymam", Cocceius.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a>. Son of man, thou dwellest amidst the refractory generation, who have eyes to see, and see not; and have ears to hear, and hear not; for they are a refractory generation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Ezekiel 12:3</a>. And thou, son of man, make thyself an outfit for exile, and depart by day before their eyes; and depart from thy place to another place before their eyes: perhaps they might see, for they are a refractory generation. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-4.htm">Ezekiel 12:4</a>. And carry out thy things like an outfit for exile by day before their eyes; but do thou go out in the evening before their eyes, as when going out to exile. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-5.htm">Ezekiel 12:5</a>. Before their eyes break through the wall, and carry it out there. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-6.htm">Ezekiel 12:6</a>. Before their eyes take it upon thy shoulder, carry it out in the darkness; cover thy face, and look not upon the land; for I have set thee as a sign to the house of Israel. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>. And I did so as I was commanded: I carried out my things like an outfit for exile by day, and in the evening I broke through the wall with my hand; I carried it out in the darkness; I took it upon my shoulder before their eyes. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-2.htm">Ezekiel 12:2</a> the reason is assigned for the command to perform the symbolical action, namely, the hard-heartedness of the people. Because the generation in the midst of which Ezekiel dwelt was blind, with seeing eyes, and deaf, with hearing ears, the prophet was to depict before its eyes, by means of the sign that followed, the judgment which was approaching; in the hope, as is added in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-3.htm">Ezekiel 12:3</a>, that they might possibly observe and lay the sign to heart. The refractoriness (&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1514; &#1502;&#1512;&#1497;, as in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/2-5.htm">Ezekiel 2:5-6</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a>, etc.) is described as obduracy, viz., having eyes, and not seeing; having ears, and not hearing, after <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-3.htm">Deuteronomy 29:3</a> (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/5-21.htm">Jeremiah 5:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/6-9.htm">Isaiah 6:9</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/matthew/13-14.htm">Matthew 13:14-15</a>). The root of this mental blindness and deafness was to be found in obstinacy, i.e., in not willing; "in that presumptuous insolence," as Michaelis says, "through which divine light can obtain no admission." &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497; &#1490;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492;, the goods (or outfit) of exile, were a pilgrim's staff and traveller's wallet, with the provisions and utensils necessary for a journey. Ezekiel was to carry these out of the house into the street in the day-time, that the people might see them and have their attention called to them. Then in the evening, after dark, he was to go out himself, not by the door of the house, but through a hole which he had broken in the wall. He was also to take the travelling outfit upon his shoulder and carry it through the hole and out of the place, covering his face all the while, that he might not see the land to which he was going. "Thy place" is thy dwelling-place. &#1499;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1510;&#1488;&#1497; : as the departures of exiles generally take place, i.e., as exiles are accustomed to depart, not "at the usual time of departure into exile," as H&#1492;vernick proposes. For &#1502;&#1493;&#1495;&#1488;, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/5-1.htm">Micah 5:1</a>. &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492; differs from &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1512;&#1489;, and signifies the darkness of the depth of night (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/15-17.htm">Genesis 15:17</a>); not, however, "darkness artificially produced, equivalent to, with the eyes shut, or the face covered; so that the words which follow are simply explanatory of &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1500;&#1496;&#1492;," as Schmieder imagines. Such an assumption would be at variance not only with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>, but also with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-12.htm">Ezekiel 12:12</a>, where the covering or concealing of the face is expressly distinguished from the carrying out "in the dark." The order was to be as follows: In the day-time Ezekiel was to take the travelling outfit and carry it out into the road; then in the evening he was to go out himself, having first of all broken a hole through the wall as evening was coming on; and in the darkness of night he was to place upon his shoulders whatever he was about to carry with him, and take his departure. This he was to do, because God had made him a mo&#772;phe&#772;th for Israel: in other words, by doing this he was to show himself to be a marvellous sign to Israel. For mo&#772;phe&#772;th, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/12-7.htm">Ezekiel 12:7</a>, the execution of the command, which evidently took place in the strictness of the letter, is fully described. There was nothing impracticable in the action, for breaking through the wall did not preclude the use of a hammer or some other tool. </body></html>
