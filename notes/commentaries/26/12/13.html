Josephus has a curious story (<span class= "ital">Antiq. </span>x. 7, § 2), that Zedekiah was inclined to believe the warnings of Jeremiah that he should be carried captive to Babylon; but when Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, saying that he should not see the land, he conceived the two prophecies to be contradictory, and so disbelieved them both. Zedekiah’s death in Babylon is mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm" title="Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.">Jeremiah 52:11</a>.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/12.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>12:1-16 By the preparation for removal, and his breaking through the wall of his house at evening, as one desirous to escape from the enemy, the prophet signified the conduct and fate of Zedekiah.

Meaning the Chaldean army, which the Lord raised up, and brought against him, and gave success unto: <p>and he shall be taken in my snare; as a bird is taken in the snare of the fowler; or a wild beast by the hunter. The Jews have a tradition, which is mentioned both by Jarchi, Kimchi, and Abendana on the place, that there was a cave which reached from Zedekiah's house to the plains of Jericho, by the way of which he fled; and that God prepared a deer, which went upon the top of the cave; and the Chaldeans pursued it; and when it came to the mouth of the cave, Zedekiah was coming out, and they took him: <p>and I will bring him to Babylon to the land of the Chaldeans; yet shall he not see it; his eyes being put out at Riblah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-7.htm">Jeremiah 39:7</a>. The Prophet Jeremiah says that his eyes should behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>; and yet here Ezekiel says that he should not see the land of the Chaldeans. Josephus (u) observes, that Zedekiah thought these two prophecies contradicted each other, and therefore gave credit to neither; but they both proved true; he saw the king of Babylon at Riblah; but his eyes being there put out, he saw not Babylon, whither he was carried captive: <p>though he shall die there; as he did, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-11.htm">Jeremiah 52:11</a>. <p>(u) Joseph.

The king’s flight shall be unavailing; he shall be captured and brought blinded to Babylon, where he shall die.

The prediction of ver. 12 is reiterated with emphasis. Zedekiah shall be in Babylon, yet shall not see. Josephus ('Ant.,' 10. 7:2; 8:2) relates that Ezekiel sent this prophecy to Jerusalem, and that Zedekiah, finding an apparent discrepancy in the words that he should not see Babylon, and those of Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-4.htm">Jeremiah 32:4</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-3.htm">Jeremiah 34:3</a>), hardened himself in his unbelief. There is no reason, however, for supposing that Josephus had access to any other records than the books of the two prophets, and his narrative looks rather like an imagined history of what might have been. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/11.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The promise that the Lord would preserve to Himself a holy seed among those who had been carried away captive, brought to a close the announcement of the judgment that would fall upon the ancient Israel and apostate Jerusalem. All that is now wanting, as a conclusion to the whole vision, is the practical confirmation of the announcement of judgment. This is given in the two following verses. - <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-22.htm">Ezekiel 11:22</a>. And the cherubim raised their wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was up above them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-23.htm">Ezekiel 11:23</a>. And the glory of Jehovah ascended from the midst of the city, and took its stand upon the mountain which is to the east of the city. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-24.htm">Ezekiel 11:24</a>. And wind lifted me up, and brought me to Chaldea to the exiles, in the vision, in the Spirit of God; and the vision ascended away from me, which I had seen. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-25.htm">Ezekiel 11:25</a>. And I spoke to the exiles all the words of Jehovah, which He had shown to me. - The manifestation of the glory of the Lord had already left the temple, after the announcement of the burning of Jerusalem, and had taken its stand before the entrance of the eastern gate of the outer court, that is to say, in the city itself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/10-19.htm">Ezekiel 10:19</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/11-1.htm">Ezekiel 11:1</a>). But now, after the announcement had been made to the representatives of the authorities of their removal from the city, the glory of the God of Israel forsook the devoted city also, as a sign that both temple and city had ceased to be the seats of the gracious presence of the Lord. The mountain on the east of the city is the Mount of Olives, which affords a lofty outlook over the city. There the glory of God remained, to execute the judgment upon Jerusalem. Thus, according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/14-4.htm">Zechariah 14:4</a>, will Jehovah also appear at the last judgment on the Mount of Olives above Jerusalem, to fight thence against His foes, and prepare a way of escape for those who are to be saved. It was from the Mount of Olives also that the Son of God proclaimed to the degenerate city the second destruction (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/19-21.htm">Luke 19:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/matthew/24-3.htm">Matthew 24:3</a>); and from the same mountain He made His visible ascension to heaven after His resurrection (<a href="https://biblehub.com/luke/24-50.htm">Luke 24:50</a>; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/acts/1-12.htm">Acts 1:12</a>); and, as Grotius has observed, "thus did Christ ascend from this mountain into His kingdom, to execute judgment upon the Jews."<p>After this vision of the judgments of God upon the ancient people of the covenant and the kingdom of God, Ezekiel was carried back in the spirit into Chaldea, to the river Chaboras. The vision then vanished; and he related to the exiles all that he had seen. </body></html>
