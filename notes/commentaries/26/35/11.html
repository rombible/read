In the multitude of words, not one is unknown to God; not the most idle word; and the most daring is not above his rebuke. In the destruction of the enemies of the church, God designs his own glory; and we may be sure that he will not come short of his design.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2</a>. Son of man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel; prophesy, and say to them, to the shepherds, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Woe to the shepherds of Israel, who fed themselves; should not the shepherds feed the flock? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3</a>. Ye eat the fat, and clothe yourselves whit the wool; ye slay the fattened; the flock ye do not feed. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>. The weak ones ye do not strengthen, and that which is sick ye do not cure, the wounded one ye bind not up, the scattered ye bring not back, and the lost one ye do not seek; and ye rule over them with violence and with severity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>. Therefore they were scattered, because without shepherd, and became food to all the beasts of the field, and were scattered. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>. My sheep wander about on all the mountains, and on every high hill; and over all the land have my sheep been scattered, and there is no one who asks for them, and no one who seeks them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-7.htm">Ezekiel 34:7</a>. Therefore, ye shepherds, hear ye the word of Jehovah: <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a>. As I live, is the saying of the Lord Jehovah, because my sheep become a prey, and my sheep become food to all the beasts of the field, because there is no shepherd, and my shepherds do not inquire after my sheep, and the shepherds feed themselves, but do not feed the sheep, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-9.htm">Ezekiel 34:9</a>. Therefore, ye shepherds, hear ye the word of Jehovah, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm">Ezekiel 34:10</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will deal with the shepherds, and will demand my sheep from their hand, and cause them to cease to feed my flock, that they may feed themselves no more; and I will deliver my sheep from their mouth, that they may be food to them no more. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-2.htm">Ezekiel 34:2</a> &#1500;&#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501; is an explanatory apposition to &#1488;&#1500;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;, and is not to be taken in connection with &#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1488;&#1502;&#1512; &#1497;&#1497;, in opposition to the constant use of this formula, as Kliefoth maintains. The reason for the woe pronounced is given in the apposition, who fed themselves, whereas they ought to have fed the flock; and the charge that they only care for themselves is still further explained by a description of their conduct (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>), and of the dispersion of the flock occasioned thereby (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>). Observe the periphrastic preterite &#1492;&#1497;&#1493;&#1468; &#1512;&#1506;&#1497;&#1501;, they were feeding, which shows that the woe had relation chiefly to the former shepherds or rulers of the nation. &#1488;&#1493;&#1514;&#1501; is reflective, se ipsos (cf. Gesen. 124. 1b). The disgracefulness of their feeding themselves is brought out by the question, "Ought not the shepherds to feed the flock?" <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3</a> shows how they fed themselves, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a> how they neglected the flock. &#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, the fat, which Bochart and Hitzig propose to alter into &#1492;&#1495;&#1500;&#1489;, the milk, after the Septuagint and Vulgate, is not open to any objection. The fat, as the best portion of the flesh, which was laid upon the altar, for example, in the case of the sacrifices, as being the flower of all the flesh, is mentioned here as pars melior pro toto. Hvernick has very properly pointed, in vindication of the reading in the text, to <a href="http://biblehub.com/zechariah/11-16.htm">Zechariah 11:16</a>, where the two clauses, ye eat the fat, and slay the fattened, are joined together in the one clause, "the flesh of the fattened one will he eat." There is no force in the objection raised by Hitzig, that "the slaughtering of the fat beasts, which ought to be mentioned first, is not introduced till afterwards;" for this clause contains a heightening of the thought that they use the flock to feed themselves: they do not even kill the leaner beasts, but those that are well fattened; and it follows very suitably after the general statement, that they make use of both the flesh and the wool of the sheep for their own advantage. They care nothing for the wellbeing of the flock: this is stated in the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-3.htm">Ezekiel 34:3</a>, which is explained in detail in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>. &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; is the Niphal participle of &#1495;&#1500;&#1492;, and is a contracted form of &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514;, like &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/17-11.htm">Isaiah 17:11</a>. The distinction between &#1504;&#1492;&#1500;&#1493;&#1514; and &#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1492; is determined by the respective predicates &#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511; and &#1512;&#1508;&#1488;. According to these, &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;&#1492; signifies that which is weak in consequence of sickness, and &#1495;&#1500;&#1492; that which is weak in itself. &#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;, literally, that which is broken, an animal with a leg or some other member injured. &#1504;&#1491;&#1468;&#1495;, scattered, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/22-1.htm">Deuteronomy 22:1</a>.<p>In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-4.htm">Ezekiel 34:4</a>, the neglect of the flock is summed up in the positive expression, to rule over them with violence and severity. &#1512;&#1491;&#1492; &#1489;&#1508;&#1512;&#1498; is taken from <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-43.htm">Leviticus 25:43</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-46.htm">Leviticus 25:46</a>; but there as well as here it points back to <a href="http://biblehub.com/exodus/1-13.htm">Exodus 1:13-14</a>, where &#1489;&#1508;&#1512;&#1498; is applied to the tyrannical measures adopted by Pharaoh for the oppression of the Israelites. The result of this (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>) was, that the sheep were scattered, and became food to the beasts of prey. &#1502;&#1489;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;, on account of there not being a shepherd, i.e., because there was no shepherd worthy of the name. This took place when Israel was carried away into exile, where it became a prey to the heathen nations. When we find this mournful fate of the people described as brought about by the bad shepherds, and attributable to faults of theirs, we must not regard the words as applying merely to the mistaken policy of the kings with regard to external affairs (Hitzig); for this was in itself simply a consequence of their neglect of their theocratic calling, and of their falling away from the Lord into idolatry. It is true that the people had also made themselves guilty of this sin, so that it was obliged to atone not only for the sins of its shepherds, but for its own sin also; but this is passed by here, in accordance with the design of this prophecy. And it could very properly be kept out of sight, inasmuch as the rulers had also occasioned the idolatry of the people, partly by their neglect of their duty, and partly by their bad example. &#1493;&#1514;&#1468;&#1508;&#1493;&#1468;&#1510;&#1497;&#1504;&#1492; is repeated with emphasis at the close of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-5.htm">Ezekiel 34:5</a>; and the thought is still further expanded in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>. The wandering upon all the mountains and hills must not be understood as signifying the straying of the people to the worship on high places, as Theodoret and Kliefoth suppose. The fallacy of this explanation is clearly shown by the passage on which this figurative description rests (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/22-17.htm">1 Kings 22:17</a>), where the people are represented as scattered upon the mountains in consequence of the fall of the king in battle, like a flock that had no shepherd. The words in the next clause, corresponding to the mountains and hills, are &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1508;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509;, the whole face of the land, not "of the earth" (Kliefoth). For although the dispersion of the flock actually consisted in the carrying away of the people into heathen lands, the actual meaning of the figure is kept in the background here, as is evident from the fact that Ezekiel constantly uses the expression &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1510;&#1493;&#1514; (plural) when speaking of the dispersion among the heathen (cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/13.htm">Ezekiel 13</a>). The distinction between &#1491;&#1468;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; and &#1489;&#1468;&#1511;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473; is, that &#1491;&#1512;&#1513;&#1473; taht , signifies rather to ask, inquire for a thing, to trouble oneself about it, whereas &#1489;&#1511;&#1513;&#1473; means to seek for that which has strayed or is lost. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-7.htm">Ezekiel 34:7-10</a>, the punishment for their unfaithfulness is announced to the shepherds themselves; but at the same time, as is constantly the case with Ezekiel, their guilt is once more recapitulated as an explanation of the threatening of punishment, and the earnest appeal to listen is repeated in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-9.htm">Ezekiel 34:9</a>. The Lord will demand His sheep of them; and because sheep have been lost through their fault, He will dispose them from the office of shepherd, and so deliver the poor flock from their violence. If we compare with this <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/23-2.htm">Jeremiah 23:2</a> : "Behold, I will visit upon you the wickedness of your doings," the threat in Ezekiel has a much milder sound. There is nothing said about the punishment of the shepherd, but simply that the task of keeping the sheep shall be taken from them, so that they shall feed themselves no more. This distinction is to be explained from the design of our prophecy, which is not so much to foretell the punishment of the shepherds, as the deliverance from destruction of the sheep that have been plunged into misery. The repetition of &#1510;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, my flock (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-8.htm">Ezekiel 34:8</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-10.htm">Ezekiel 34:10</a>, as before in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-6.htm">Ezekiel 34:6</a>), is also connected with this. The rescue of the sheep out of the hand of the bad shepherds had already commenced with the overthrow of the monarchy on the destruction of Jerusalem. If, then it is here described as only to take place in the future, justice is not done to these words by explaining them, as Hitzig does, as signifying that what has already actually taken place is now to be made final, and not to be reversed. For although this is implied, the words clearly affirm that the deliverance of the sheep out of the hand of the shepherds has not yet taken place, but still remains to be effected, so that the people are regarded as being at the time in the power of bad shepherds, and their rescue is predicted as still in the future. How and when it will be accomplished, by the removal of the bad shepherds, is shown in the announcement, commencing with <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/34-11.htm">Ezekiel 34:11</a>, of what the Lord will do for His flock. </body></html>
