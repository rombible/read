But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Garrisons - pillars, on which stood statues of some protecting god.

The rendering “pillars of thy strength,” those in which Tyre confided and thought her strength to lie (Ges.), is rather out of the way here; more naturally, her proud or majestic pillars, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm" title="Speak to the house of Israel, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the excellency of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and that which your soul pities; and your sons and your daughters whom you have left shall fall by the sword.">Ezekiel 24:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm" title="Also, you son of man, shall it not be in the day when I take from them their strength, the joy of their glory, the desire of their eyes, and that whereupon they set their minds, their sons and their daughters,">Ezekiel 24:25</a>.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/26.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 11.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">Thy strong garrisons</span>; literally, <span class="accented">the pillars of thy strength</span> (Revised Version).

The words probably refer to the two famous columns standing in the temple of the Tyrian Hercules, one of gold and one of emerald (possibly malachite or lapis-lazuli), as symbols of strength, or as pedestals surmounted by a statue of Baal (Herod., 2:44). <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/25.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Against the Philistines<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-15.htm">Ezekiel 25:15</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because the Philistines act with revenge, and avenge themselves with contempt in the soul to destroy in everlasting enmity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand over the Philistines, and cut off the Cretans, and destroy the remnant by the seashore. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-17.htm">Ezekiel 25:17</a>. And I will execute great vengeance upon them through chastisements of wrath, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring my vengeance upon them. - The Philistines resembled the Edomites and Ammonites in their disposition towards the covenant nation, the former in their thirst for revenge, the latter in their malicious rejoicing at Israel's fall. For this reason they had already been classed by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>) with Edom, Moab, and Ammon as enemies, who would be successfully attacked and overcome by Israel, when the Lord had gathered it again from its dispersion. In the description of its sin towards Israel we have a combination of elements taken from the conduct of Edom and Ammon (vv. 12 and 6). They execute revenge with contempt in the soul (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, as in v. 6), with the intention to destroy (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;) Israel; and this revenge springs from eternal, never-ending hostility. The Lord will cut off the whole of the people of the Philistines for this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, Cretans, originally a branch of the Philistian people, settled in the south-west of Canaan. The name is used by Ezekiel for the people, as it had already been by Zephaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>), for the sake of the paronomasia with &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The origin of the name is involved in obscurity, as the current derivation from Creta rests upon a very doubtful combination (cf. Stark, Gaza, pp. 66 and 99ff.). By the "remnant of the sea-coast," i.e., the remnant of the inhabitants of the coast of the Mediterranean, in other words, of the Philistines, the destruction of which had already been predicted by Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>), Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>), and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm">Jeremiah 42:4</a>), we are to understand the whole nation to the very last man, all that was still left of the Philistines (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>). - The execution of the vengeance threatened by God began in the Chaldean period, in which Gaza was attacked by Pharaoh, and, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1-7</a>, the whole of Philistia was laid waste by the Chaldeans (see the fuller comments on this in the exposition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1-7</a>). But the ultimate fulfilment will take place in the case of Philistia also, through the Messianic judgment, in the manner described in the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. </body></html>
