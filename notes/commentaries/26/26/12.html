It is no longer Nebuchadnezzar who does these things, but “they.” This may intimate that the prophet’s vision now again passes beyond the immediate future to the long succession of calamities, beginning indeed with Nebuchadnezzar’s conquest, with which Tyre was to be visited. The “spoil” and “prey” is to be understood more of what the Tyrians lost than of what the conquerors gained. In the long-continued sieges to which the city was subjected there was great waste of its substance; but their command of the water generally enabled them before the close to send away their moveable wealth, so that the booty of the victor was small. (With the close of the verse comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-4.htm" title="And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.">Ezekiel 26:4</a>.) The situation of Tyre led naturally to her ruins being thrown into the sea.

Howl, you ships of Tarshish; for it is laid waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.">Isaiah 23:1</a>. It was also fulfilled with respect to the new city, which “received a great blow from Alexander, not only by his taking and burning it, but much more by his building of Alexandria in Egypt, which in time deprived it of much of its trade, and thereby contributed more effectually to its ruin. It had the misfortune afterward of changing its masters often, being sometimes in the hands of the Ptolemies, kings of Egypt, and sometimes of the Seleucidæ, kings of Syria, till at length it fell under the dominion of the Romans. It was taken by the Saracens about the year of Christ 639, in the reign of Omar, their third emperor. It was retaken by the Christians, during the time of the holy war, in the year 1124: Baldwin, the second of that name, being then king of Jerusalem, and assisted by a fleet of the Venetians. From the Christians it was taken again, in the year 1289, by the Mamelukes of Egypt, under their sultan, Alphix, who sacked and razed this, and Zidon, and other strong towns, that they might not ever again afford any harbour or shelter to the Christians. From the Mamelukes it was again taken, in the year 1516, by Selim, the ninth emperor of the Turks, and under their dominion it continues at present. But, alas! how fallen! how changed from what it was formerly! for, from being the centre of trade, frequented by all the merchant ships of the east and west, it is now become a heap of ruins, visited only by the boats of a few poor fisher-men: see note on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-4.htm" title="And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.">Ezekiel 26:4</a>.

But it comes from a selfish, covetous principle, and from that love of the world as our happiness, which the love of God expressly forbids. He often blasts the projects of those who would raise themselves on the ruin of others. The maxims most current in the trading world, are directly opposed to the law of God. But he will show himself against the money-loving, selfish traders, whose hearts, like those of Tyre, are hardened by the love of riches. Men have little cause to glory in things which stir up the envy and rapacity of others, and which are continually shifting from one to another; and in getting, keeping, and spending which, men provoke that God whose wrath turns joyous cities into ruinous heaps.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/26.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Garrisons - pillars, on which stood statues of some protecting god.

When its lofty buildings and towers fall, surrounded as it was with the sea which entered its double harbor and washed its ramparts, the "stones &#8230; timbers &#8230; and dust" appropriately are described as thrown down "in the midst of the water." Though Ezekiel attributes the capture of Tyre to Nebuchadnezzar (see on [1066]Eze 29:18), yet it does not follow that the final destruction of it described is attributed by him to the same monarch. The overthrow of Tyre by Nebuchadnezzar was the first link in the long chain of evil&#8212;the first deadly blow which prepared for, and was the earnest of, the final doom. The change in this verse from the individual conqueror "he," to the general "they," marks that what he did was not the whole, but only paved the way for others to complete the work begun by him. It was to be a progressive work until she was utterly destroyed. Thus the words here answer exactly to what Alexander did. With the "stones, timber," and rubbish of Old Tyre, he built a causeway in seven months to New Tyre on the island and so took it [Curtius, 4, 2], 322 B.C.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/26.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">They; </span> Chaldean soldiers. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make a spoil; </span> hinder thy trade during the war, and plunder thee in the end of the war. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Make a prey of thy merchandise; </span> intercepting much, as it is coming to thee whilst besieged, and taking what they find, when they conquer. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Break down thy walls:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-4.htm" title="And they shall destroy the walls of Tyrus, and break down her towers: I will also scrape her dust from her, and make her like the top of a rock.">Ezekiel 26:4</a>,9</span>; there he speaks of the walls of the city, here of the walls of private houses, as appears by that which follows.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Because the Philistines act with revenge, and avenge themselves with contempt in the soul to destroy in everlasting enmity, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-16.htm">Ezekiel 25:16</a>. Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will stretch out my hand over the Philistines, and cut off the Cretans, and destroy the remnant by the seashore. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-17.htm">Ezekiel 25:17</a>. And I will execute great vengeance upon them through chastisements of wrath, and they shall know that I am Jehovah, when I bring my vengeance upon them. - The Philistines resembled the Edomites and Ammonites in their disposition towards the covenant nation, the former in their thirst for revenge, the latter in their malicious rejoicing at Israel's fall. For this reason they had already been classed by Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-14.htm">Isaiah 11:14</a>) with Edom, Moab, and Ammon as enemies, who would be successfully attacked and overcome by Israel, when the Lord had gathered it again from its dispersion. In the description of its sin towards Israel we have a combination of elements taken from the conduct of Edom and Ammon (vv. 12 and 6). They execute revenge with contempt in the soul (&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496; &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, as in v. 6), with the intention to destroy (&#1500;&#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1495;&#1497;&#1514;) Israel; and this revenge springs from eternal, never-ending hostility. The Lord will cut off the whole of the people of the Philistines for this. &#1499;&#1468;&#1512;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, Cretans, originally a branch of the Philistian people, settled in the south-west of Canaan. The name is used by Ezekiel for the people, as it had already been by Zephaniah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-5.htm">Zephaniah 2:5</a>), for the sake of the paronomasia with &#1492;&#1499;&#1512;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;. The origin of the name is involved in obscurity, as the current derivation from Creta rests upon a very doubtful combination (cf. Stark, Gaza, pp. 66 and 99ff.). By the "remnant of the sea-coast," i.e., the remnant of the inhabitants of the coast of the Mediterranean, in other words, of the Philistines, the destruction of which had already been predicted by Amos (<a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>), Isaiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/14-30.htm">Isaiah 14:30</a>), and Jeremiah (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/42-4.htm">Jeremiah 42:4</a>), we are to understand the whole nation to the very last man, all that was still left of the Philistines (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/1-8.htm">Amos 1:8</a>). - The execution of the vengeance threatened by God began in the Chaldean period, in which Gaza was attacked by Pharaoh, and, judging from <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1-7</a>, the whole of Philistia was laid waste by the Chaldeans (see the fuller comments on this in the exposition of <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/47-1.htm">Jeremiah 47:1-7</a>). But the ultimate fulfilment will take place in the case of Philistia also, through the Messianic judgment, in the manner described in the commentary on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>. </body></html>
