It is now generally taken for that which is glorious or beautiful. Israel has run its circle; prosperity has developed pride, and pride has culminated in all wickedness; now the end has come, they and their tumult (marg., <span class= "ital">for multitude</span>) disappear together, and of their glory there shall be nothing left.<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rod - Used here for tribe <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>. The people of Judah have blossomed into proud luxuriance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a> it means the rod to punish wickedness. The meaning of the passage is obscure, owing to the brief and enigmatic form of the utterance. We may adopt the following explanation. The Jews had ever exulted in their national privileges - everything great and noble was to be from them and from theirs; but now Yahweh raises up the rod of the oppressor to confound and punish the rod of His people. The furious Chaldaean has become an instrument of God's wrath, endued with power emanating not from the Jews or from the multitude of the Jews, or from any of their children or people; nay, the destruction shall be so complete that none shall be left to make lamentation over them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>11. Violence (that is, the violent foe) is risen up as a rod of (that is, to punish the Jews') wickedness (Zec 5:8).<p>theirs&#8212;their possessions, or all that belongs to them, whether children or goods. Grotius translates from a different Hebrew root, "their nobles," literally, "their tumultuous trains" (Margin) which usually escorted the nobles. Thus "nobles" will form a contrast to the general "multitude."<p>neither &#8230; wailing&#8212;(Jer 16:4-7; 25:33). Gesenius translates, "nor shall there be left any beauty among them." English Version is supported by the old Jewish interpreters. So general shall be the slaughter, none shall be left to mourn the dead.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Violence; </span> with fierceness, which is their natural temper, a bitter and hasty nation, <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm" title="For, see, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to possess the dwelling places that are not theirs.">Habakkuk 1:6</a></span>; with eagerness and impetuous vigour executing, and with injustice and violence oppressing all. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Is risen up; </span> is grown up to be, though a rod to punish bad men, yet to be worse than those it punisheth; in brief, you may expect the very worst from the power, pride, and violence of those I am now letting in upon you.

And though the words may have this double aspect, yet I take them to refer principally and first to the Jews, and their near approaching sorrows. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/7.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness,.... Some understand this of the Chaldeans, who came with great violence against the Jews, and were a rod in the hand of the Lord, to scourge them for their wickedness; and this seems to be the sense of the Targum, <p>"spoilers are risen up to visit the wicked;'' <p>but rather the violence, oppression, and rapine of the Jews are meant, and mentioned as the cause of their punishment; for this their oppression of the poor and needy, the widow and the fatherless, among them, God suffered the king of Babylon, a wicked prince, to come and chastise them: <p>none of them shall remain, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs; meaning not the Chaldean army, as if they came not of themselves, but of God, and much less were cut off, for they returned to their own land again; but the Jews, who either should die in the siege with the famine and pestilence, or be put to death by the sword, or be carried into captivity: <p>neither shall there be wailing for them; the destruction should be so general, that there would be but few left to mourn; and those that were left would be struck with such a stupor and amazement at the calamity, that they would not be capable of mourning; or with such a dread of the enemy, that there would be no place for lamentation over their dead friends and relations. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2"><span class="cverse3">{g}</span> Violence hath risen into a rod of wickedness: none of them <i>shall remain</i>, nor of their multitude, nor of any of theirs: neither <i>shall there be</i> wailing for them.</span><p>(g) This cruel enemy will be a sharp scourge for their wickedness.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">11</span>. “Violence” must be that in Israel, not that of the enemy. This violence has risen up so as to be, or to bring down a rod of wickedness, i.e. a rod due to wickedness or in chastisement of it (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-23.htm" title="Make a chain: for the land is full of bloody crimes, and the city is full of violence.">Ezekiel 7:23</a></span>).

The general sense conveyed when the words <span class="ital">shall remain</span> (A.V.) are inserted is that Israel and her multitude and her possessions shall be wholly swept away.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">nor of any of theirs</span>] Ges. conjectured: <span class="ital">nor of their wealth</span>, so R.V.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">wailing for them</span>] Ges. conjectured: <span class="ital">magnificence</span>, so R.V. <span class="ital">neither shall there be eminency</span> among them. Both words rendered “wealth” and “eminency” are entirely unknown; the former is probably no word at all but a false repetition of the previous expression “none of them;” if it be a word the natural rendering is that of Ew., moaning or sighing (<span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-16.htm" title="But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.">Ezekiel 7:16</a></span> of doves), or unquietness. For the word “eminency” recourse is had to the Arab., generally a precarious proceeding. LXX. renders no account of either of the words. In his reconstruction of the text Corn. follows LXX. generally to the end of <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-9.htm" title="And my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: I will recompense you according to your ways and your abominations that are in the middle of you; and you shall know that I am the LORD that smites.">Ezekiel 7:9</a></span>; <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/7-10.htm" title="Behold the day, behold, it is come: the morning is gone forth; the rod has blossomed, pride has budded....">Ezekiel 7:10-11</a></span> he emends thus: “Behold the crown (as <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/28-5.htm" title="In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory, and for a diadem of beauty, to the residue of his people,">Isaiah 28:5</a>) is come forth, the sceptre blossoms; but the crown shall wither 11 and the sceptre fade; what are they, and what their multitude?” The crown and sceptre are those of Israel.

"None of them; none of their multitude; none of their wealth." <span class="cmt_word">Neither shall there be wailing for them.</span> The noun is not found elsewhere. Taken, as the Authorized Version takes it, the thought, like that of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>, is that the usual rites of burial would be neglected, and that there would be "no widows to make lamentation" (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/78-64.htm">Psalm 78:64</a>). The Revised Version "eminency" implies the loss of all that constituted greatness. Cornill and the LXX. ("beauty" or "gaiety") practically agree with this. The Vulgate gives <span class="accented">requies</span>, and Furst "a gathering, or tumult of the people."

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Woe on all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel! that they must perish by sword, hunger, and pestilence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. He that is afar off will die by the pestilence; and he that is near at hand shall fall by the sword; and he who survives and is preserved will die of hunger: and I shall accomplish my wrath upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when your slain lie in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, upon all the summits of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-leaved terebinth, on the places where they brought their pleasant incense to all their idols. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>. And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land waste and desolate more than the wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings: so shall ye know that I am Jehovah. - Through clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet - the gestures which indicate violent excitement - the prophet is to make known to the displeasure of Jehovah at the horrible idolatry of the people, and thereby make manifest that the penal judgment is well deserved. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> expressed more distinctly by &#1492;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500; , "to strike one hand against the other," i.e., "to clap the hands;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>. &#1488;&#1495;, an exclamation of lamentation, occurring only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, is a conjunction, "at." Their abominations are so wicked, that they must be exterminated on account of them. This is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. No one will escape the judgment: he who is far removed from its scene as little as he who is close at hand; while he who escapes the pestilence and the sword is to perish of hunger. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, servatus, preserved, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The signification "besieged" (lxx, Vulgate, Targum, etc.), Hitzig can only maintain by arbitrarily expunging &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; as a gloss.

On account of the prevalence of idolatry in all parts, God will make the land entirely desolate. The union of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;  serves to strengthen the idea; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>. The words &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; are obscure, either "in the wilderness towards Diblath" (even to Diblath), or "more than the wilderness of Diblath" (&#1502;&#1503; of comparison). There is no doubt that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is a nom. prop.; cf. the name of the city &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>. The second acceptation of the words is more probable than the first. For, if &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is the terminus a quo, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; the terminus ad quem of the extent of the land, then must &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; be punctuated not only as status absolut., but it must also have the article; because a definite wilderness - that, namely, of Arabia - is meant. The omission of the article cannot be justified by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a> or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a> (Hitzig, Ewald), because both passages contain general designations of the quarters of the world, with which the article is always omitted. In the next place, no Dibla can be pointed out in the north; and the change of Diblatha into Ribla, already proposed by Jerome, and more recently brought forward again by J. D. Michaelis, has not only against it the authority of all the old versions, but also the circumstance that the Ribla mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a> did not form the northern boundary of Palestine, but lay on the other side of it, in the land of Hamath; while the &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, is a place on the eastern boundary to the north of the Sea of Gennesareth, which would, moreover, be inappropriate as a designation of the northern boundary. Finally, the extent of the land from the south to the north is constantly expressed in a different way; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-65.htm">2 Kings 14:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>; and even by Ezekiel himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>) &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  is named as the boundary on the north. The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is similar to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, although the name is hardly to be explained, with Hvernick, as an appellation, after the Arabic dibl, calamitas, exitium. The wilderness of Diblah is unknown.
