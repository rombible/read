Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal.

The Chaldeans will be masters of the land, so that neither shall the buyer have any good of his purchase, nor the seller any loss; nor shall the latter (Eze 7:13) return to his inheritance at the jubilee year (see Le 25:13). Spiritually this holds good now, seeing that "the time is short"; "they that rejoice should be as though they rejoiced not, and they that buy as though they possessed not": Paul (1Co 7:30) seems to allude to Ezekiel here. Jer 32:15, 37, 43, seems to contradict Ezekiel here. But Ezekiel is speaking of the parents, and of the present; Jeremiah, of the children, and of the future. Jeremiah is addressing believers, that they should hope for a restoration; Ezekiel, the reprobate, who were excluded from hope of deliverance.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The time is come:</span> see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-2.htm" title="Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land.">Ezekiel 7:2</a>,3,6,7</span>.

According to the Targum, the time of the recompence of iniquities, and the day of punishment of sins; of the sins of the Jews, by the Chaldean army, which no doubt is true; but it seems chiefly to refer to what follows: and the sense is, the time was coming on, in which <p>let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn; it is usual for the buyer of houses or lands to rejoice, because an addition is made to his estate, and especially when he has made, as he thinks, a good purchase; and the seller, he mourns because he is obliged to part with his estate to pay his debts, and so is reduced in his circumstances; but now the time was coming when the one would have no occasion to rejoice, nor the other to mourn; not the buyer rejoice, because, being carried captive, he cannot enjoy his possessions; nor the seller mourn, because, if he had not sold his house or field, he must have left it: <p>for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof; upon the whole body of the Jewish nation, high and low, rich and poor, bond and free, buyer and seller; those that are in good circumstances, and those that are in bad ones; so that hereby they were all upon a level, in the same case and condition. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">The time is come, the day draweth near: let not the buyer <span class="cverse3">{i}</span> rejoice, nor the seller <span class="cverse3">{k}</span> mourn: for wrath <i>is</i> upon all its multitude.</span><p>(i) For the present profit.<p>(k) For he will lose nothing.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/7.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">12</span>. The inhabitants shall be overwhelmed in a common ruin, in which all social relations shall be forgotten—the buyer shall not rejoice nor the seller sorrow.

They belonged, it will be remembered, to the nobler and wealthier class (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-19.htm">2 Kings 25:19</a>). They, it would seem, had been compelled to sell their estates at a price which made the "buyer rejoice and the seller mourn." In each case the joy and the sorrow would be but transient. Wrath had gone out against the whole multitude. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/2-2.htm">Micah 2:2</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/5-8.htm">Isaiah 5:8</a> we have parallel instances of the advantage taken by the rich of the distress of the old tree holders. In the story of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-6.htm">Jeremiah 32:6-16</a> we have, though from a very different point of view, the history of a like purchase, while the city was actually surrounded by the Chaldeans. The neglect of the sabbatic year (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/34-8.htm">Jeremiah 34:8-17</a>) makes it probable that the jubilee year also (if, indeed, it had ever been more than an ideal) had fallen into desuetude, and that the buyers comforted themselves with the thought that the land they had got, on cheap terms, weald belong to them and their children forever. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Punishment Is Just and Well Deserved<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Woe on all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel! that they must perish by sword, hunger, and pestilence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. He that is afar off will die by the pestilence; and he that is near at hand shall fall by the sword; and he who survives and is preserved will die of hunger: and I shall accomplish my wrath upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when your slain lie in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, upon all the summits of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-leaved terebinth, on the places where they brought their pleasant incense to all their idols. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>. And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land waste and desolate more than the wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings: so shall ye know that I am Jehovah. - Through clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet - the gestures which indicate violent excitement - the prophet is to make known to the displeasure of Jehovah at the horrible idolatry of the people, and thereby make manifest that the penal judgment is well deserved. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> expressed more distinctly by &#1492;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500; , "to strike one hand against the other," i.e., "to clap the hands;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>. &#1488;&#1495;, an exclamation of lamentation, occurring only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, is a conjunction, "at." Their abominations are so wicked, that they must be exterminated on account of them. This is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. No one will escape the judgment: he who is far removed from its scene as little as he who is close at hand; while he who escapes the pestilence and the sword is to perish of hunger. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, servatus, preserved, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The signification "besieged" (lxx, Vulgate, Targum, etc.), Hitzig can only maintain by arbitrarily expunging &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; as a gloss. On <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>; on 13a, cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a>; and on 13b, cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>. '&#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;, according to later usage, for &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, used in the Pentateuch of sacrifices pleasing to God, is here transferred to idol sacrifices; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>. On account of the prevalence of idolatry in all parts, God will make the land entirely desolate. The union of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;  serves to strengthen the idea; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>. The words &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; are obscure, either "in the wilderness towards Diblath" (even to Diblath), or "more than the wilderness of Diblath" (&#1502;&#1503; of comparison). There is no doubt that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is a nom. prop.; cf. the name of the city &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>. The second acceptation of the words is more probable than the first. For, if &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is the terminus a quo, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; the terminus ad quem of the extent of the land, then must &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; be punctuated not only as status absolut., but it must also have the article; because a definite wilderness - that, namely, of Arabia - is meant. The omission of the article cannot be justified by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a> or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a> (Hitzig, Ewald), because both passages contain general designations of the quarters of the world, with which the article is always omitted. In the next place, no Dibla can be pointed out in the north; and the change of Diblatha into Ribla, already proposed by Jerome, and more recently brought forward again by J. D. Michaelis, has not only against it the authority of all the old versions, but also the circumstance that the Ribla mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a> did not form the northern boundary of Palestine, but lay on the other side of it, in the land of Hamath; while the &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, is a place on the eastern boundary to the north of the Sea of Gennesareth, which would, moreover, be inappropriate as a designation of the northern boundary. Finally, the extent of the land from the south to the north is constantly expressed in a different way; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-65.htm">2 Kings 14:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>; and even by Ezekiel himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>) &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  is named as the boundary on the north. The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is similar to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, although the name is hardly to be explained, with Hvernick, as an appellation, after the Arabic dibl, calamitas, exitium. The wilderness of Diblah is unknown. With '&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the discourse is rounded off in returning to the beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>, while the thoughts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a> are only a variation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4-7</a>. </body></html>
