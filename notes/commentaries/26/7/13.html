Among the Israelites the most important buying and selling was that of land, and it was provided in the law (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/leviticus/25-14.htm" title="And if you sell ought to your neighbor, or buy ought of your neighbor's hand, you shall not oppress one another:">Leviticus 25:14-16</a>) that this should in no case extend beyond the year of jubilee, when all land must revert to its possessor by inheritance. The seller in that year should return to his possession. Now it is foretold that the desolation shall continue so long that, even if the seller lived, he should be unable to avail himself of the jubilee year. “It is a natural thing to rejoice in the purchase of property, and to mourn over its sale, but when slavery and captivity stare you in the face, rejoicing and mourning are equally absurd” (S. Jerome). The idea of the latter part of the verse is, that no one shall grow strong since his life is passed in iniquity.<p><span class= "bld"><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>7:1-15 The abruptness of this prophecy, and the many repetitions, show that the prophet was deeply affected by the prospect of these calamities. Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Although they were yet alive - Though they be yet among the living.<p>Which shall not return ... - He (i. e. the seller) shall not return; and, every man living in his iniquity, they shall gather no strength.

In the year of jubilee, because he shall be in captivity: according to the law in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-13.htm">Leviticus 25:13</a>, when a man had sold his possession, he returned to it again, if alive, in the year of jubilee; let it come sooner or later, within thirty, or twenty, or ten years after the sale, be it as it will: now the Babylonish captivity being seventy years, in that time there must be a jubilee; and yet those that had sold their estates, being captives in another land, could not return to them: <p>although they were yet alive: either though what they have sold is in being, and in good condition; or rather, though they that have sold them are in the land of the living, but, not being in their own land, cannot possess: <p>for the vision is touching the whole multitude thereof; the prophecy of the destruction of the Jews is general, and respects the whole body of the people; men of all ranks and degrees, the buyer and the seller, the rich and the poor: <p>which shall not return; void and of no effect, but shall be fully accomplished; see <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/54-11.htm">Isaiah 54:11</a>; though some think this refers not to prophecy, but to the people, who did not upon it return by repentance; in this sense it is taken by Jarchi and Kimchi; and so the Targum, <p>"for the prophets prophesied to the whole multitude of them to return by repentance, and they returned not:'' <p>neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life: either secure himself from danger by his unrighteous mammon, his ill gotten goods; or think to escape by his daring impiety, and vicious course of life, continued in without repentance. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/7.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">For the seller shall not <span class="cverse3">{l}</span> return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive: for the <span class="cverse3">{m}</span> vision <i>is</i> concerning its whole multitude, <i>which</i> shall not return; <span class="cverse3">{n}</span> neither shall any strengthen himself in the iniquity of his life.</span><p>(l) In the year of the Jubile, meaning that none would enjoy the privilege of the law, Le 25:13 for they would all be carried away captives.<p>(m) This vision signified that all would be carried away, and none would return for the Jubile.<p>(n) No man for all this endeavours himself or takes heart to repent for his evil life.

When they were redeemed the seller would “return to that which was sold.” By the Law real property returned to the original owner at the year of freedom. This hope is vain: the coming calamity shall obliterate all titles. Others conjecture that the prophet has before his mind the case of the captives carried away with Jehoiachin, who were compelled to make forced sales of their property before going into exile, and who longed to return to claim what was theirs.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">although they were yet alive</span>] Or, <span class="bld">while they are</span>; i.e. never, so long as they live.<span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="ital">for the vision</span>] Instead of “vision” <span class="ital">wrath should be read</span>: <span class="bld">for wrath is upon all the multitude thereof</span>,” as <span class="ital"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm" title="The time is come, the day draws near: let not the buyer rejoice, nor the seller mourn: for wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:12</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm" title="They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goes to the battle: for my wrath is on all the multitude thereof.">Ezekiel 7:14</a></span>.

Or if there be no reference to those two classes the statements are general: none shall return to his possessions, and none shall live in his iniquity.<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/7.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 13.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">For the seller shall not return,</span> etc. At first the thought seems only to add to the sorrow of the seller. He is told that he, at least, shall not return to his old estate. Even though they should be alive at the year of jubilee, their exile had to last its appointed time, Ezekiel's forty (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-6.htm">Ezekiel 4:6</a>) and Jeremiah's seventy years (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/25-11.htm">Jeremiah 25:11</a>). This, however, did not exclude the return of their children (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/32-44.htm">Jeremiah 32:44</a>), and in the mean time all private sorrow would fall into the background as compared with the great public woe of the destruction of the holy city. <span class="cmt_word">The vision is touching,</span> etc. The noun is used as a synonym for prophecy, as elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-1.htm">Isaiah 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/1-1.htm">Nahum 1:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/2-1.htm">Habakkuk 2:1</a>). It may be noted that it is specially characteristic of Ezekiel (seven times) and Daniel (eleven times). For the Authorized Version read with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">none shall return</span>, or better (with the Vulgate and Keil), <span class="accented">the vision touching the whole multitude shall not return, i.e.</span> shall go straight onward to do its work (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). So taken, there is a kind of play upon the iterated word: "The seller shall not turn his footsteps back, neither shall the prophecy." <span class="accented">Vestigia nulla retrorsum</span> shall be true of both. I take the other words, with the Revised Version, <span class="accented">no man in the iniquity of his life shall strengthen himself</span>, noting the fact that the word for "strengthen" is that which enters into Ezekiel's name. It is as though he said, "God is the only true source of strength to thee, as thy very name bears witness." <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Punishment Is Just and Well Deserved<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>. Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Woe on all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel! that they must perish by sword, hunger, and pestilence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. He that is afar off will die by the pestilence; and he that is near at hand shall fall by the sword; and he who survives and is preserved will die of hunger: and I shall accomplish my wrath upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when your slain lie in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, upon all the summits of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-leaved terebinth, on the places where they brought their pleasant incense to all their idols. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>. And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land waste and desolate more than the wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings: so shall ye know that I am Jehovah. - Through clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet - the gestures which indicate violent excitement - the prophet is to make known to the displeasure of Jehovah at the horrible idolatry of the people, and thereby make manifest that the penal judgment is well deserved. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> expressed more distinctly by &#1492;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500; , "to strike one hand against the other," i.e., "to clap the hands;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>. &#1488;&#1495;, an exclamation of lamentation, occurring only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, is a conjunction, "at." Their abominations are so wicked, that they must be exterminated on account of them. This is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. No one will escape the judgment: he who is far removed from its scene as little as he who is close at hand; while he who escapes the pestilence and the sword is to perish of hunger. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, servatus, preserved, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The signification "besieged" (lxx, Vulgate, Targum, etc.), Hitzig can only maintain by arbitrarily expunging &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; as a gloss.

'&#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;, according to later usage, for &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, used in the Pentateuch of sacrifices pleasing to God, is here transferred to idol sacrifices; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>. On account of the prevalence of idolatry in all parts, God will make the land entirely desolate. The union of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;  serves to strengthen the idea; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>. The words &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; are obscure, either "in the wilderness towards Diblath" (even to Diblath), or "more than the wilderness of Diblath" (&#1502;&#1503; of comparison). There is no doubt that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is a nom. prop.; cf. the name of the city &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>. The second acceptation of the words is more probable than the first. For, if &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is the terminus a quo, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; the terminus ad quem of the extent of the land, then must &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; be punctuated not only as status absolut., but it must also have the article; because a definite wilderness - that, namely, of Arabia - is meant. The omission of the article cannot be justified by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a> or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a> (Hitzig, Ewald), because both passages contain general designations of the quarters of the world, with which the article is always omitted. In the next place, no Dibla can be pointed out in the north; and the change of Diblatha into Ribla, already proposed by Jerome, and more recently brought forward again by J. D. Michaelis, has not only against it the authority of all the old versions, but also the circumstance that the Ribla mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a> did not form the northern boundary of Palestine, but lay on the other side of it, in the land of Hamath; while the &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, is a place on the eastern boundary to the north of the Sea of Gennesareth, which would, moreover, be inappropriate as a designation of the northern boundary. Finally, the extent of the land from the south to the north is constantly expressed in a different way; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-65.htm">2 Kings 14:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>; and even by Ezekiel himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>) &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  is named as the boundary on the north. The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is similar to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, although the name is hardly to be explained, with Hvernick, as an appellation, after the Arabic dibl, calamitas, exitium. The wilderness of Diblah is unknown. With '&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the discourse is rounded off in returning to the beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>, while the thoughts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a> are only a variation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4-7</a>. </body></html>
