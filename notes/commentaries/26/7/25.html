Behold the day, behold, it cometh; the fate springeth up; the rod sprouteth; the pride blossometh. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a>. The violence riseth up as the rod of evil: nothing of them, nothing of their multitude, nothing of their crowd, and nothing glorious upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm">Ezekiel 7:12</a>. The time cometh, the day approacheth: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller trouble himself; for wrath cometh upon the whole multitude thereof. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>. For the seller will not return to that which was sold, even though his life were still among the living: for the prophecy against its whole multitude will not turn back; and no one will strengthen himself as to his life through his iniquity. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>. They blow the trumpet and make everything ready; but no one goeth into the battle: for my wrath cometh upon all their multitude. - The rod is already prepared; nothing will be left of the ungodly. This is the leading thought of the strophe. The three clauses of <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-10.htm">Ezekiel 7:10</a> are synonymous; but there is a gradation in the thought. The approaching fate springs up out of the earth (&#1497;&#1510;&#1488;, applied to the springing up of plants, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/5-13.htm">1 Kings 5:13</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/11-1.htm">Isaiah 11:1</a>, etc.); it sprouts as a rod, and flowers as pride. Matteh, the rod as an instrument of chastisement (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/10-5.htm">Isaiah 10:5</a>). This rod is then called za equals dho4n, pride, inasmuch as God makes use of a proud and violent people, namely the Chaldeans (<a href="https://biblehub.com/habakkuk/1-6.htm">Habakkuk 1:6</a>.; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/50-31.htm">Jeremiah 50:31</a> seq.), to inflict the punishment. Sprouting and blossoming, which are generally used as figurative representations of fresh and joyous prosperity, denote here the vigorous growth of that power which is destined to inflict the punishment. Both cha&#770;ma&#770;s (violence) and za&#770;dho&#772;n (pride) refer to the enemy who is to chastise Israel. The violence which he employs rises up into the chastening rod of "evil," i.e., of ungodly Israel. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a> the effect of the blow is described in short, broken sentences. The emotion apparent in the frequent repetition of &#1500;&#1488; is intensified by the omission of the verb, which gives to the several clauses the character of exclamations. So far as the meaning is concerned, we have to insert &#1497;&#1492;&#1497;&#1492; in thought, and to take &#1502;&#1503; ekat o in a partitive sense: there will not be anything of them, i.e., nothing will be left of them (the Israelites, or the inhabitants of the land). &#1502;&#1492;&#1501; (of them) is explained by the nouns which follow. &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; and the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0;. &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1500;&#1495;&#1493;&#1500;&#1501;&Aring;&iexcl;, plural of &#1492;&#1501; or &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, both derivatives of &#1492;&#1502;&#1492;, are so combined that &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; signifies the tumultuous multitude of people, &#1492;&#1502;&#1492; the multitude of possessions (like &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503;, <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/60-2.htm">Isaiah 60:2</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/37-16.htm">Psalm 37:16</a>, etc.). The meaning which Hvernick assigns to ha&#770;meh, viz., anxiety or trouble, is unsupported and inappropriate. The &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;. &#1504;&#1492;&#1468; is not to be derived from &#1504;&#1492;&#1492;, to lament, as the Rabbins affirm; or interpreted, as Kimchi - who adopts this derivation - maintains, on the ground of <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-4.htm">Jeremiah 16:4</a>., as signifying that, on account of the multitude of the dying, there will be no more lamentation for the dead. This leaves the Mappik in &#1492; unexplained. &#1504;&#1492;&#1468; is a derivative of a root &#1504;&#1493;&#1492;&#1468;; in Arabic, na equals ha, elata fuit res, eminuit, magnificus fuit; hence  ,&#1504;&#1492;&#1468;res magnifica. When everything disappears in such a way as this, the joy occasioned by the acquisition of property, and the sorrow caused by its loss, will also pass away (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm">Ezekiel 7:12</a>). The buyer will not rejoice in the property he has bought, for he will not be able to enjoy it; and the seller will not mourn that he has been obliged to part with his possession, for he would have lost it in any case.<p>(Note: "It is a natural thing to rejoice in the purchase of property, and to mourn over its sale. But when slavery and captivity stare you in the face, rejoicing and mourning are equally absurd." - Jerome.)<p>The wrath of God is kindled against their whole multitude; that is to say, the judgment falls equally upon them all. The suffix in &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; refers, as Jerome has correctly shown, to the "land of Israel" (admath, Yisra&#770;eel) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-2.htm">Ezekiel 7:2</a>, i.e., to the inhabitants of the land. The words, "the seller will not return to what he has sold," are to be explained from the legal regulations concerning the year of Jubilee in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25.htm">Leviticus 25</a>, according to which all landed property that had been sold was to revert to its original owner (or his heir), without compensation, in the year of jubilee; so that he would then return to his mimka&#770;r (<a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-14.htm">Leviticus 25:14</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/25-27.htm">Leviticus 25:27-28</a>). Henceforth, however, this will take place no more, even if &#1492;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501;, their (the sellers') life, should be still alive (sc., at the time when the return to his property would take place, according to the regulations of the year of jubilee), because Israel will be banished from the land. The clause '&#1493;&#1506;&#1493;&#1491; &#1489;&#1468;&#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1497;&#1501; &#1492; is a conditional circumstantial clause. The seller will not return (&#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;) to his possession, because the prophecy concerning the whole multitude of the people will not return (&#1500;&#1488;), i.e., will not turn back (for this meaning of &#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/45-23.htm">Isaiah 45:23</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/55-11.htm">Isaiah 55:11</a>). As &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489; corresponds to the previous &#1500;&#1488; &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1493;&#1468;&#1489;, so does &#1495;&#1494;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500; &#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; to &#1495;&#1512;&#1493;&#1503; &#1488;&#1500;&#1470;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1492;&#1502;&#1493;&#1504;&#1492;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-12.htm">Ezekiel 7:12</a>. In the last clause of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-13.htm">Ezekiel 7:13</a>, &#1495;&#1497;&#1468;&#1514;&#1493; is not to be taken with &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; in the sense of "in the iniquity of his life," which makes the suffix in &#1489;&#1468;&#1506;&#1493;&#1504;&#1493; superfluous, but with &#1497;&#1514;&#1495;&#1494;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1468;, the Hithpael being construed with the accusative, "strengthen himself in his life." Whether these words also refer to the year of jubilee, as Hvernick supposes, inasmuch as the regulation that every one was to recover his property was founded upon the idea of the restitution and re-creation of the theocracy, we may leave undecided; since the thought is evidently simply this: ungodly Israel shall be deprived of its possession, because the wicked shall not obtain the strengthening of his life through his sin. This thought leads on to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-14.htm">Ezekiel 7:14</a>, in which we have a description of the utter inability to offer any successful resistance to the enemy employed in executing the judgment. There is some difficulty connected with the word &#1489;&#1468;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506;, since the infin. absolute, which the form &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506;  seems to indicate, cannot be construed with either a preposition or the article. Even if the expression  &#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506; &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/6-1.htm">Jeremiah 6:1</a> was floating before the mind of Ezekiel, and led to his employing the bold phrase  &#1468;&#1489;&#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506;, this would not justify the use of the infinitive absolute with a preposition and the article. &#1514;&#1468;&#1511;&#1493;&#1506; must be a substantive form, and denote not clangour, but the instrument used to sound an alarm, viz., the sho&#772;pha&#770;r (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-3.htm">Ezekiel 33:3</a>). &#1492;&#1499;&#1497;&#1503;, an unusual form of the inf. abs. (see <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/7-7.htm">Joshua 7:7</a>), used in the place of the finite tense, and signifying to equip for war, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/nahum/2-4.htm">Nahum 2:4</a>. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1500;, everything requisite for waging war. And no one goes into the battle, because the wrath of God turns against them (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-17.htm">Leviticus 26:17</a>), and smites them with despair (<a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-30.htm">Deuteronomy 32:30</a>). </body></html>
