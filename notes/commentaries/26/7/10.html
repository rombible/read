There will be then an allusion to the rods of the tribes in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm" title="And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds.">Numbers 17:8</a>. There the rod of Aaron was made to bud and blossom by Divine power in evidence of his having been chosen of God; here the rod representing the tribe at Jerusalem in its self-will and pride has budded and blossomed to its destruction.

Or the sense may be, Nebuchadnezzar, the rod of God’s anger, the rod of correction ordained for Judah, is grown in power and pride, in violence and cruelty, and is thus prepared to punish the Jews, whose pride and luxury, injustice and idolatry, have exposed them to this instrument of the divine vengeance. <span class="ital">Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness — </span>Some render this, <span class="ital">Violence is risen up against the rod of wickedness, </span>and understand it of the violent, impetuous Chaldean army rising up against the tribe of Judah, here called the rod of wickedness, to cut it down. <span class="ital">None of them shall remain — </span>The Hebrew only expresses <span class="ital">none of them, </span>the words <span class="ital">shall remain </span>being supplied by our translators.

Such will the destruction of sinners be; for none can avoid it. Oh that the wickedness of the wicked might end before it bring them to an end! Trouble is to the impenitent only an evil, it hardens their hearts, and stirs up their corruptions; but there are those to whom it is sanctified by the grace of God, and made a means of much good. The day of real trouble is near, not a mere echo or rumour of troubles. Whatever are the fruits of God's judgments, our sin is the root of them. These judgments shall be universal. And God will be glorified in all. Now is the day of the Lord's patience and mercy, but the time of the sinner's trouble is at hand.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/7.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Rod - Used here for tribe <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/31-2.htm">Exodus 31:2</a>. The people of Judah have blossomed into proud luxuriance. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-11.htm">Ezekiel 7:11</a> it means the rod to punish wickedness. The meaning of the passage is obscure, owing to the brief and enigmatic form of the utterance. We may adopt the following explanation. The Jews had ever exulted in their national privileges - everything great and noble was to be from them and from theirs; but now Yahweh raises up the rod of the oppressor to confound and punish the rod of His people. The furious Chaldaean has become an instrument of God's wrath, endued with power emanating not from the Jews or from the multitude of the Jews, or from any of their children or people; nay, the destruction shall be so complete that none shall be left to make lamentation over them. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/7.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>10. rod &#8230; blossomed, pride &#8230; budded&#8212;The "rod" is the Chaldean Nebuchadnezzar, the instrument of God's vengeance (Isa 10:5; Jer 51:20). The rod sprouting (as the word ought to be translated), &c., implies that God does not move precipitately, but in successive steps. He as it were has planted the ministers of His vengeance, and leaves them to grow till all is ripe for executing His purpose. "Pride" refers to the insolence of the Babylonian conqueror (Jer 50:31, 32). The parallelism ("pride" answering to "rod") opposes Jerome's view, that "pride" refers to the Jews who despised God's threats; (also Calvin's, "though the rod grew in Chaldea, the root was with the Jews"). The "rod" cannot refer, as Grotius thought, to the tribe of Judah, for it evidently refers to the "smiteth" (Eze 7:9) as the instrument of smiting.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/7.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> If you will open your eyes, you may see the lowering day of vengeance: see <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-7.htm" title="The morning is come to you, O you that dwell in the land: the time is come, the day of trouble is near, and not the sounding again of the mountains.">Ezekiel 7:7</a></span>. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The rod hath blossomed:</span> this and what follows may refer either, <span class="p"><br /><br /></span>1.

The "doom" springs out of the earth; the rod of vengeance blossoms (the word is the same as that which describes the blooming of Aaron's rod (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-8.htm">Numbers 17:8</a>), and the phrase was probably suggested by the history); <span class="cmt_word">pride</span> (either that of the Chaldean ministers of vengeance, or of Israel as working out its own punishment; I incline to the latter) buds and bears fruit. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/27-6.htm">Isaiah 27:6</a> the word follows on "blossom," and therefore seems applicable to the formation of the fruit rather than the flower.

Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Woe on all the wicked abominations of the house of Israel! that they must perish by sword, hunger, and pestilence. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. He that is afar off will die by the pestilence; and he that is near at hand shall fall by the sword; and he who survives and is preserved will die of hunger: and I shall accomplish my wrath upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>. And ye shall know that I am Jehovah, when your slain lie in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on every high hill, upon all the summits of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick-leaved terebinth, on the places where they brought their pleasant incense to all their idols. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a>. And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land waste and desolate more than the wilderness of Diblath, in all their dwellings: so shall ye know that I am Jehovah. - Through clapping of the hands and stamping of the feet - the gestures which indicate violent excitement - the prophet is to make known to the displeasure of Jehovah at the horrible idolatry of the people, and thereby make manifest that the penal judgment is well deserved. &#1492;&#1499;&#1468;&#1492; &#1489;&#1499;&#1508;&#1468;&#1498; is in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-19.htm">Ezekiel 21:19</a> expressed more distinctly by &#1492;&#1498; &#1499;&#1468;&#1507; &#1488;&#1500; , "to strike one hand against the other," i.e., "to clap the hands;" cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/24-10.htm">Numbers 24:10</a>. &#1488;&#1495;, an exclamation of lamentation, occurring only here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-20.htm">Ezekiel 21:20</a>. &#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1512;, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-11.htm">Ezekiel 6:11</a>, is a conjunction, "at." Their abominations are so wicked, that they must be exterminated on account of them. This is specially mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-12.htm">Ezekiel 6:12</a>. No one will escape the judgment: he who is far removed from its scene as little as he who is close at hand; while he who escapes the pestilence and the sword is to perish of hunger. &#1504;&#1510;&#1493;&#1468;&#1512;, servatus, preserved, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/49-6.htm">Isaiah 49:6</a>. The signification "besieged" (lxx, Vulgate, Targum, etc.), Hitzig can only maintain by arbitrarily expunging &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1512; as a gloss.

'&#1488;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;, according to later usage, for &#1506;&#1500; &#1499;&#1468;&#1500;&#1470;&#1490;&#1489;. &#1512;&#1497;&#1495; &#1504;&#1497;&#1495;&#1495;, used in the Pentateuch of sacrifices pleasing to God, is here transferred to idol sacrifices; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/1-9.htm">Leviticus 1:9</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/8-21.htm">Genesis 8:21</a>. On account of the prevalence of idolatry in all parts, God will make the land entirely desolate. The union of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1502;&#1492;  serves to strengthen the idea; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-8.htm">Ezekiel 33:8</a>., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm">Ezekiel 35:3</a>. The words &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; are obscure, either "in the wilderness towards Diblath" (even to Diblath), or "more than the wilderness of Diblath" (&#1502;&#1503; of comparison). There is no doubt that &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is a nom. prop.; cf. the name of the city &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>. The second acceptation of the words is more probable than the first. For, if &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; is the terminus a quo, and &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; the terminus ad quem of the extent of the land, then must &#1502;&#1502;&#1468;&#1491;&#1489;&#1468;&#1512; be punctuated not only as status absolut., but it must also have the article; because a definite wilderness - that, namely, of Arabia - is meant. The omission of the article cannot be justified by reference to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-3.htm">Ezekiel 21:3</a> or to <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/75-7.htm">Psalm 75:7</a> (Hitzig, Ewald), because both passages contain general designations of the quarters of the world, with which the article is always omitted. In the next place, no Dibla can be pointed out in the north; and the change of Diblatha into Ribla, already proposed by Jerome, and more recently brought forward again by J. D. Michaelis, has not only against it the authority of all the old versions, but also the circumstance that the Ribla mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a> did not form the northern boundary of Palestine, but lay on the other side of it, in the land of Hamath; while the &#1492;&#1512;&#1489;&#1500;&#1492;, named in <a href="http://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm">Numbers 34:11</a>, is a place on the eastern boundary to the north of the Sea of Gennesareth, which would, moreover, be inappropriate as a designation of the northern boundary. Finally, the extent of the land from the south to the north is constantly expressed in a different way; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/23-21.htm">Numbers 23:21</a> (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>); <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-5.htm">Joshua 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/8-65.htm">1 Kings 8:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/14-65.htm">2 Kings 14:65</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/amos/6-14.htm">Amos 6:14</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_chronicles/13-5.htm">1 Chronicles 13:5</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/7-8.htm">2 Chronicles 7:8</a>; and even by Ezekiel himself (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/48-1.htm">Ezekiel 48:1</a>) &#1500;&#1489;&#1493;&#1488;  is named as the boundary on the north. The form &#1491;&#1468;&#1489;&#1500;&#1514;&#1492; is similar to &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1514;&#1492; for &#1514;&#1468;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492;, although the name is hardly to be explained, with Hvernick, as an appellation, after the Arabic dibl, calamitas, exitium. The wilderness of Diblah is unknown. With '&#1493;&#1497;&#1491;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468; &#1499;&#1468;&#1497; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493; the discourse is rounded off in returning to the beginning of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a>, while the thoughts in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-13.htm">Ezekiel 6:13</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-14.htm">Ezekiel 6:14</a> are only a variation of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-4.htm">Ezekiel 6:4-7</a>. </body></html>
