Similarly in Greek there is the same word for the last two of these. (Comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/john/3-5.htm" title="Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.">John 3:5-8</a>.)<p><a name="mhc" id="mhc"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/mhc/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary</a></div>37:1-14 No created power could restore human bones to life. God alone could cause them to live. Skin and flesh covered them, and the wind was then told to blow upon these bodies; and they were restored to life. The wind was an emblem of the Spirit of God, and represented his quickening powers. The vision was to encourage the desponding Jews; to predict both their restoration after the captivity, and also their recovery from their present and long-continued dispersion. It was also a clear intimation of the resurrection of the dead; and it represents the power and grace of God, in the conversion of the most hopeless sinners to himself. Let us look to Him who will at last open our graves, and bring us forth to judgment, that He may now deliver us from sin, and put his Spirit within us, and keep us by his power, through faith, unto salvation.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/37.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Prophesy - Not in the sense of predicting what was to come to pass, but simply in that of speaking under the inspiration of God.

I &#8230; cause breath to enter into you&#8212;So Isa 26:19, containing the same vision, refers primarily to Israel's restoration. Compare as to God's renovation of the earth and all its creatures hereafter by His breath, Ps 104:30.<p>ye shall live&#8212;come to life again.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/37.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> My prophet prophesied and spake, but I, saith the Lord, only can and I will surely give life to them. When God had formed Adam’s body, as lifeless as these bones, he created him a living soul, by breathing into his face the breath of life; by a creating power he brings breath into these bones too. The effect shall be sure and speedy, when God brings his power to work it. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/37.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord God unto these bones,.... By the prophet, who was sent to prophesy over them: <p>behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live; and none could do this but the living God, who breathed the breath of life into Adam at first, and he became a living soul; to which there seems to be an allusion here; and when the Lord puts his Spirit into men, or bestows his grace on them, then they shall live, and not till then. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/37.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:</span></div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/37.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">5</span>.

The real agent, therefore, in the resuscitation of the bones was to be, not the prophet or the word, but Jehovah himself; and that the end aimed at by the Divine activity was "life" shows the breath spoken of (ruach) was not to be the wind, as in ver. 9, or the Spirit, but the breath of life, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/6-17.htm">Genesis 6:17</a> and Genesis 7:22 (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/2-7.htm">Genesis 2:7</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/104-30.htm">Psalm 104:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/26-19.htm">Isaiah 26:19</a>). </body></html>
