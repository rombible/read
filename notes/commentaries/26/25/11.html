Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Ammon and Moab, of common origin, whose lands had so often been interchanged, shall now share a common ruin.

And thou, son of man, behold, in the day when I take from them their might, their glorious joy, the delight of their eyes and the desire of their soul, their sons and their daughters, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26</a>. In that day will a fugitive come to thee, to tell it to thine ears. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>. In that day will thy mouth be opened with the fugitive, and thou wilt speak, and no longer be mute; and thus shalt thou be a sign to them that they may know that I am Jehovah. - As the destruction of Jerusalem would exert a powerful influence upon the future history of the exiles on the Chaboras, and be followed by most important results, so was it also to be a turning-point for the prophet himself in the execution of his calling. Hvernick has thus correctly explained the connection between these closing verses and what precedes, as indicated by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25</a>. As Ezekiel up to this time was to speak to the people only when the Lord gave him a word for them, and at other times was to remain silent and dumb (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a>); from the day on which a messenger should come to bring him the tidings of the destruction of Jerusalem and the temple, he was to open his mouth, and not continue dumb any longer. The execution of this word of God is related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21-22</a>. The words, "when I take from them their strength," etc., are to be understood in accordance with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>. Consequently &#1502;&#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1501; is the sanctuary, which was taken from the Israelites through the destruction of Jerusalem. The predicates which follow down to &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; refer to the temple (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>). &#1502;&#1513;&#1468;&#1474;&#1488; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;, an object toward which the soul lifts itself up (&#1504;&#1513;&#1474;&#1488;), i.e., for which it cherishes a desire or longing; hence synonymous with &#1502;&#1495;&#1502;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473; htiw suomynon in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>. The sons and daughters are attached &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;  (in that day), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26</a>, which resumes the words '&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1511; (in the day when I take, etc.) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25</a>, is not the day of the destruction of the temple, but generally the time of this event, or more precisely, the day on which the tidings would reach the prophet. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, with the generic article, a fugitive (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>). &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, to cause the ears to hear (it), i.e., to relate it, namely to the bodily ears of the prophet, whereas he had already heard it in spirit from God. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, a verbal noun, used instead of the infinitive Hiphil. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, with the escaped one, i.e., at the same time "with the mouth of the fugitive" (Hitzig). &#1488;&#1514; expresses association, or so far as the fact is concerned, simultaneousness. The words,"then wilt thou speak, and no longer be dumb," do not imply that it was only from that time forward that Ezekiel was to keep silence, but point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a>, where silence is imposed upon him, with the exceptions mentioned there, from the very commencement of his ministry; and in comparison with that passage, simply involve implicite the thought that the silence imposed upon him then was to be observed in the strictest manner from the present time until the reception of the intelligence of the fall of Jerusalem, when his mouth would be opened once more. Through the "words of God" that were given to His prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-24</a>), the Lord had now said to the people of Israel all that He had to say concerning the approaching catastrophe for them to consider and lay to heart, that they might be brought to acknowledge their sin, and turn with sorrow and repentance to their God. Therefore was Ezekiel from this time forward to keep perfect silence toward Israel, and to let God the Lord speak by His acts and the execution of His threatening words. It was not till after the judgment had commenced that his mouth was to be opened again for still further announcements (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>). - Ezekiel was thereby to become a sign to the Israelites. These words have a somewhat different meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a> from that which they have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>. There, Ezekiel, by the way in which he behaved at the death of his wife, was to be a sign to the people of the manner in which they were to act when the judgment should fall upon Jerusalem; whereas here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>), &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514; refers to the whole of the ministry of the prophet, his silence hitherto, and that which he was still to observe, as well as his future words. Through both of these he was to exhibit himself to his countrymen as a man whose silence, speech, and action were alike marvellous and full of meaning to them, and all designed to lead them to the knowledge of the Lord, the God of their salvation. </body></html>
