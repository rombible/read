Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>Edom, so named from Esau, consisted of various tribes enumerated in <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/36.htm">Genesis 36</a>.

David conquered them, but in the reign of Joram they rebelled and were not again subdued <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/8-20.htm">2 Kings 8:20</a>. Under the name of Idumea the land was conquered by John Hyrcanus (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-14.htm">Ezekiel 25:14</a>), when many of the people adopted the religion of the Jews. In later times the Idumean Herod became king of Palestine, reckoning himself as a Jew. Mount Seir, deserted by its original inhabitants, was occupied by a tribe of Arabians (the Nabatheans), under whelm Petra rose and continued a flourishing city under Roman dominion, until the tide of Mahometan conquest brought it to that ruin in which Edom at last found the complete fulfillment of the prophecies uttered against it <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-1.htm">Ezekiel 35:1-15</a>.<p>Taking vengeance - Referring to the wrong done by Jacob to Esau <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>12. taking vengeance&#8212;literally, "revenging with revengement," that is, the most unrelenting vengeance. It was not simple hatred, but deep-brooding, implacable revenge. The grudge of Edom or Esau was originally for Jacob's robbing him of Isaac's blessing (Ge 25:23; 27:27-41). This purpose of revenge yielded to the extraordinary kindness of Jacob, through the blessing of Him with whom Jacob wrestled in prayer; but it was revived as an hereditary grudge in the posterity of Esau when they saw the younger branch rising to the pre-eminence which they thought of right belonged to themselves. More recently, for David's subjugation of Edom to Israel (2Sa 8:14). They therefore gave vent to their spite by joining the Chaldeans in destroying Jerusalem (Ps 137:7; La 4:22; Ob 10-14), and then intercepting and killing the fugitive Jews (Am 1:11) and occupying part of the Jewish land as far as Hebron.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Edom; </span> the Idumeans, children of Esau. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">The house of Judah; </span> the kingdom of David after the division of the tribes, when but two remained constant to the house of David. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">By taking vengeance</span> for the old quarrel, because Jacob got the blessing from Esau, or rather in revenging a later quarrel, which they had against Judah for the slaughter, spoil, and captivity they suffered by David’s conquering sword. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Hath greatly offended; </span> both in the thing itself, for vengeance belongs to God; and in the manner and measures of executing it, as appears both from <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm" title="Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of Jerusalem; who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof.">Psalm 137:7</a></span>, and the prophecy of <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/obadiah/1-10.htm" title="For your violence against your brother Jacob shame shall cover you, and you shall be cut off for ever....">Obadiah 1:10-15</a></span>, which see, and consider. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord God,....

The moment of Judah's weakness was seized on as an opportunity for gratifying what Ezekiel elsewhere (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-5.htm">Ezekiel 35:5</a>) calls the "perpetual hatred" of the people against Israel, for taking vengeance for the primal wrong which Esau had suffered at the hand of Jacob (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/27-36.htm">Genesis 27:36</a>).

The name, which signifies "South," was probably applied to a district - twice, here and in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-7.htm">Jeremiah 49:7, 8</a>, coupled with Dedan. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-20.htm">Jeremiah 49:20, 21</a> the cry of the inhabitants of Teman is said to have been "heard in the Red Sea," and this determines its geographical position, as being, in accordance with its name, the southern region of Edom. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/2-11.htm">Job 2:11</a> we have Eliphaz the Temanite as one of the patriarch's friends, and the same  name appears as that of a son of Esau (<a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/36-11.htm">Genesis 36:11</a>). In Jeremiah (<span class="accented">loc</span>. <span class="accented">cit</span>.) Teman is named as famous for its wisdom.

It has been inferred from this that there were two branches of the nation, one on the shores of the Persian Gulf, nomadic and trading, as in the "travelling companies" of Dedanim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/21-13.htm">Isaiah 21:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/27-15.htm">Ezekiel 27:15, 20</a>); the other settled in the territory of the Edomites ('Dict.

Hvernick has thus correctly explained the connection between these closing verses and what precedes, as indicated by &#1493;&#1488;&#1514;&#1468;&#1492; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25</a>.

The execution of this word of God is related in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-21.htm">Ezekiel 33:21-22</a>.

The sons and daughters are attached &#x3b1;&#787;&#x3c3;&#x3c5;&#x3bd;&#x3b4;&#x3b5;&#x3c4;&#x3c9;&#834;&#x3c2;. &#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1468;&#1493;&#1501;  (in that day), in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-26.htm">Ezekiel 24:26</a>, which resumes the words '&#1489;&#1468;&#1497;&#1493;&#1501; &#1511; (in the day when I take, etc.) in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-25.htm">Ezekiel 24:25</a>, is not the day of the destruction of the temple, but generally the time of this event, or more precisely, the day on which the tidings would reach the prophet. &#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, with the generic article, a fugitive (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/14-13.htm">Genesis 14:13</a>). &#1500;&#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514; &#1488;&#1494;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, to cause the ears to hear (it), i.e., to relate it, namely to the bodily ears of the prophet, whereas he had already heard it in spirit from God. &#1492;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1506;&#1493;&#1468;&#1514;, a verbal noun, used instead of the infinitive Hiphil. &#1488;&#1514;&#1470;&#1492;&#1508;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1496;, with the escaped one, i.e., at the same time "with the mouth of the fugitive" (Hitzig). &#1488;&#1514; expresses association, or so far as the fact is concerned, simultaneousness. The words,"then wilt thou speak, and no longer be dumb," do not imply that it was only from that time forward that Ezekiel was to keep silence, but point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-26.htm">Ezekiel 3:26</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/3-27.htm">Ezekiel 3:27</a>, where silence is imposed upon him, with the exceptions mentioned there, from the very commencement of his ministry; and in comparison with that passage, simply involve implicite the thought that the silence imposed upon him then was to be observed in the strictest manner from the present time until the reception of the intelligence of the fall of Jerusalem, when his mouth would be opened once more. Through the "words of God" that were given to His prophet (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4.htm">Ezekiel 4-24</a>), the Lord had now said to the people of Israel all that He had to say concerning the approaching catastrophe for them to consider and lay to heart, that they might be brought to acknowledge their sin, and turn with sorrow and repentance to their God. Therefore was Ezekiel from this time forward to keep perfect silence toward Israel, and to let God the Lord speak by His acts and the execution of His threatening words. It was not till after the judgment had commenced that his mouth was to be opened again for still further announcements (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/33-22.htm">Ezekiel 33:22</a>). - Ezekiel was thereby to become a sign to the Israelites. These words have a somewhat different meaning in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a> from that which they have in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>. There, Ezekiel, by the way in which he behaved at the death of his wife, was to be a sign to the people of the manner in which they were to act when the judgment should fall upon Jerusalem; whereas here (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-27.htm">Ezekiel 24:27</a>), &#1500;&#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514; refers to the whole of the ministry of the prophet, his silence hitherto, and that which he was still to observe, as well as his future words. Through both of these he was to exhibit himself to his countrymen as a man whose silence, speech, and action were alike marvellous and full of meaning to them, and all designed to lead them to the knowledge of the Lord, the God of their salvation. </body></html>
