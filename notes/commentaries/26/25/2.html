They were collected together to illustrate their original purpose of warning the nations not to exult in their neighbor's fall. Seven nations are addressed, which have had most contact with the children of Israel - on their eastern borders Moab and Ammon, to the south, Edom, on the south-west Philistia, northward Tyre (the merchant city) and the more ancient Sidon, and lastly Egypt, alternately the scourge and the false stay of the chosen people. The number "seven" is symbolic of completeness. "Seven" prophecies against Egypt the chief of "seven" nations, denote the completeness of the overthrow of the pagan power, the antagonist of the kingdom of God. While other prophets hold out to these pagan nations some prospect of future mercy (e. g., <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/16-14.htm">Isaiah 16:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-6.htm">Jeremiah 49:6</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-11.htm">Jeremiah 49:11</a>), Ezekiel speaks of their complete ruin. He was contemplating "national" ruin. In the case of Jerusalem there would be national restoration, but in the case of the pagan no such recovery. The "national" ruin was irretrievable; the remnant to whom the other prophets hold out hopes of mercy were to find it as individuals gathered into God's Church, not as nations to be again set up. Ezekiel does not, like other prophets, prophesy against Babylon; it was his mission to show that for the moment, Babylon was the righteous instrument of the divine wrath, doing God's work in punishing His foes. In prophesying against foreign nations, Ezekiel often adopts the language of those who preceded him.<p>In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25.htm">Ezekiel 25</a>, the four nations most closely connected with one another by geographical position and by contact, are addressed in a few brief sentences concluding with the same refrain - "Ye shall know that I am the Lord" (e. g. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-5.htm">Ezekiel 25:5</a>). This prophecy was delivered immediately after the capture of the city by Nebuchadnezzar, and so is later, in point of time, than some of the prophecies that follow it.<p>The Ammonites were inveterate foes of the descendants of Abraham.<a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/25.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>CHAPTER 25<p>Eze 25:1-17.

Their ruin was to be utter: Israel's but temporary (Jer 46:28). The nations denounced are seven, the perfect number; implying that God's judgments would visit, not merely these, but the whole round of the heathen foes of God. Babylon is excepted, because she is now for the present viewed as the rod of God's retributive justice, a view too much then lost sight of by those who fretted against her universal supremacy.<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">Set thy face against:</span> the phrase you have <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-46.htm" title="Son of man, set your face toward the south, and drop your word toward the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field;">Ezekiel 20:46</a></span>.

Here we read that when they saw that Jerusalem had been laid waste, they, like Edom (<a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/137-7.htm">Psalm 137:7</a>), exulted in her downfall.

And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a>. Son of man, behold, I take from thee thine eyes' delight by a stroke, and thou shalt not mourn nor weep, and no tear shall come from thee. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-17.htm">Ezekiel 24:17</a>.

And I spake to the people in the morning, and in the evening my wife died, and I did in the morning as I was commanded. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-19.htm">Ezekiel 24:19</a>. Then the people said to me, Wilt thou not show us what this signifies to us that thou doest so? <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-20.htm">Ezekiel 24:20</a>. And I said to them, The word of Jehovah has come to me, saying, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a>. Say to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah, Behold, I will profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the delight of your eyes, and the desire of your soul; and your sons and your daughters, whom ye have left, will fall by the sword. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-22.htm">Ezekiel 24:22</a>. Then will ye do as I have done, ye will not cover the beard, nor eat the bread of men; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a>. And ye will have your head-attired upon your heads, and your shoes upon your feet; ye will not mourn nor weep, but will pine away in your iniquity, and sigh one towards another. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-24.htm">Ezekiel 24:24</a>. Thus will Ezekiel be a sign to you; as he hath done will ye do; when it cometh, ye will know that I the Lord am Jehovah. - From the statements in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-18.htm">Ezekiel 24:18</a>, to the effect that the prophet spoke to the people in the morning, and then in the evening his wife died, and then again in the (following) morning, according to the command of God, he manifested no grief, and in answer to the inquiry of the people explained to them the meaning of what he did, it is evident that the word of God contained in this section came to him on the same day as the preceding one, namely, on the day of the blockade of Jerusalem; for what he said to the people on the morning of this day (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-18.htm">Ezekiel 24:18</a>) is the prophecy contained in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-3.htm">Ezekiel 24:3-14</a>. Immediately after He had made this revelation to him, God also announced to him the approaching death of his wife, together with the significance which this event would have to the people generally. The delight of the eyes (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-16.htm">Ezekiel 24:16</a>) is his wife (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-18.htm">Ezekiel 24:18</a>) &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1490;&#1468;&#1508;&#1492; by a stroke, i.e., by a sudden death inflicted by God (vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/14-37.htm">Numbers 14:37</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/17-13.htm">Numbers 17:13</a>). On the occurrence of her death, he is neither to allow of any loud lamentings, nor to manifest any sign of grief, but simply to sigh in silence. &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501; &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; does not stand for &#1488;&#1489;&#1500; &#1502;&#1514;&#1497;&#1501;, but the words are both accusatives. The literal rendering would be: the dead shalt thou not make an object of mourning, i.e., thou shalt not have any mourning for the dead, as Storr (observv. p. 19) has correctly explained the words. On occasions of mourning it was customary to uncover the head and strew ashes upon it (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>), to go barefoot (<a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/15-30.htm">2 Samuel 15:30</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/20-2.htm">Isaiah 20:2</a>), and to cover the beard, that is to say, the lower part of the face as far as the nose (<a href="https://biblehub.com/micah/3-7.htm">Micah 3:7</a>). Ezekiel is not to do any of these things, but to arrange his head-attire (&#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;, the head-attire generally, or turban, vid., <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-23.htm">Ezekiel 24:23</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/61-3.htm">Isaiah 61:3</a>, and not specially that of the priests, which is called &#1508;&#1468;&#1488;&#1512;&#1497; in <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/39-28.htm">Exodus 39:28</a>), and to put on his shoes, and also to eat no mourning bread. &#1500;&#1495;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; does not mean panis miseroroum, cibus lugentium, in which case &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501; would be equivalent to &#1488;&#1504;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1501;, but bread of men, i.e., of the people, that is to say, according to the context, bread which the people were accustomed to send to the house of mourning in cases of death, to manifest their sympathy and to console and refresh the mourners - a custom which gave rise in the course of time to that of formal funeral meals. These are not mentioned in the Old Testament; but the sending of bread or food to the house of mourning is clearly referred to in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/26-14.htm">Deuteronomy 26:14</a>; <a href="http://biblehub.com/hosea/9-4.htm">Hosea 9:4</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/16-7.htm">Jeremiah 16:7</a> (see also <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_samuel/3-35.htm">2 Samuel 3:35</a>). - When Ezekiel thus abstained from all lamentation and outward sign of mourning on the death of his dearest one, the people conjectured that such striking conduct must have some significance, and asked him what it was that he intended to show thereby. He then announced to them the word of God (<a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-20.htm">Ezekiel 24:20-24</a>). As his dearest one, his wife, had been taken from him, so should it dearest object, the holy temple, be taken from the nation by destruction, and their children by the sword. When this occurred, then would they act as he was doing now; they would not mourn and weep, but simply in their gloomy sorrow sigh in silence on account of their sins, and groan one toward another.<p>The profanation (&#1495;&#1500;&#1468;&#1500;) of the sanctuary is effected through its destruction (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/7-24.htm">Ezekiel 7:24</a>). To show the magnitude of the loss, the worth of the temple in the eyes of the nation is dwelt upon in the following clauses. &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1493;&#1503; &#1506;&#1494;&#1468;&#1499;&#1501; is taken from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-19.htm">Leviticus 26:19</a>. The temple is called the pride of your strength, because Israel based its might and strength upon it as the scene of the gracious presence of God, living in the hope that the Lord would not give up His sanctuary to the heathen to be destroyed, but would defend the temple, and therewith Jerusalem and its inhabitants also (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/7-4.htm">Jeremiah 7:4</a>). &#1502;&#1492;&#1502;&#1500; &#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1501; , the desire or longing of the soul (from &#1492;&#1502;&#1500;, in Arabic, desiderio ferri ad aliquam rem). The sons and daughters of the people are the relatives and countrymen whom the exiles had been obliged to leave behind in Canaan. - The explanation of this lamentation and mourning on account of the destruction of the sanctuary and death of their relations, is to be found in the antithesis: '&#1493;&#1468;&#1504;&#1502;&#1511;&#1468;&#1514;&#1501; &#1489;&#1506;&#1493;, ye will pine or languish away in your iniquities (compare <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-17.htm">Ezekiel 4:17</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-39.htm">Leviticus 26:39</a>). Consequently we have not to imagine either "stolid indifference" (Eichhorn and Hitzig), or "stolid impenitence" (Ewald), but overwhelming grief, for which there were no tears, no lamentation, but only deep inward sighing on account of the sins which had occasioned so terrible a calamity. &#1504;&#1492;&#1501;, lit., to utter a deep growl, like the bears (<a href="https://biblehub.com/isaiah/59-11.htm">Isaiah 59:11</a>); here to sigh or utter a deep groan. "One toward another," i.e., manifesting the grief to one another by deep sighs; not "full of murmuring and seeking the sin which occasioned the calamity in others rather than in themselves," as Hitzig supposes. The latter exposition is entirely at variance with the context. This grief, which consumes the bodily strength, leads to a clear perception of the sin, and also to true repentance, and through penitence and atonement to regeneration and newness of life. And thus will they attain to a knowledge of the Lord through the catastrophe which bursts upon them (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-40.htm">Leviticus 26:40</a>.). For &#1502;&#1493;&#1508;&#1514;, a sign, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/exodus/4-21.htm">Exodus 4:21</a>. </body></html>
