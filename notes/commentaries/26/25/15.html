At times they held the greater part of the land of Israel in subjection, and at times were subdued in their turn. Although belonging to another branch of the Hamitic family, their land was included with that of the Canaanites in the territory to be given to the Israelites (<a href="https://biblehub.com/context/joshua/13-2.htm" title="This is the land that yet remains: all the borders of the Philistines, and all Geshuri,">Joshua 13:2-3</a>). It was never, however, occupied by them, although the cities were fortified and garrisoned by some of the kings. The land lay along the coast of the Mediterranean, on the highway between Egypt and Assyria and Chaldæa, and consequently, in the struggles of those nations with each other the Philistines were gradually more and more reduced, until they disappeared entirely. Among the many prophecies against them, the following may be especially referred to: <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/isaiah/14-29.htm" title="Rejoice not you, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that smote you is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying serpent.">Isaiah 14:29-32</a>; Jeremiah 47; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/amos/1-6.htm" title="Thus said the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them up to Edom:">Amos 1:6-8</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/zephaniah/2-4.htm" title="For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be rooted up.">Zephaniah 2:4-7</a>.<p><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/benson/ezekiel/25.htm">Benson Commentary</a></div><span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/25-15.htm" title="Thus said the Lord GOD; Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge, and have taken vengeance with a despiteful heart, to destroy it for the old hatred;...">Ezekiel 25:15-17</a></span>. <span class="ital">Because the Philistines have dealt by revenge — </span>The Philistines being borderers upon the Jews, were their ancient enemies, from the very time of the judges downward, more particularly in the time of Ahaz: see <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_chronicles/28-18.htm" title="The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh, and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and the villages thereof: and they dwelled there.">2 Chronicles 28:18</a>. <span class="ital">Therefore I will stretch out my hand upon the Philistines </span>— I will bring calamities upon them, and enemies who shall subdue them.

Those who glory in any other defence and protection than the Divine power, providence, and promise, will, sooner or later, be ashamed of their glorying. Those who will not leave it to God to take vengeance for them, may expect that he will take vengeance on them. The equity of the Lord's judgments is to be observed, when he not only avenges injuries upon those that did them, but by those against whom they were done. Those who treasure up old hatred, and watch for the opportunity of manifesting it, are treasuring up for themselves wrath against the day of wrath.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/25.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>The Philistines occupying lands to the south of Judah were a Hamite race <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/10-14.htm">Genesis 10:14</a>, but of a different branch from the Canaanites. They were a powerful people never dispossessed by the Israelites <a href="https://biblehub.com/joshua/13-3.htm">Joshua 13:3</a>. They were a thorn in the side of the chosen people throughout, and joined in attacking Jerusalem in the day of her trouble.

(1Sa 13:1-14:52; 2Ch 28:18). The "old hatred" refers to their continual enmity to the covenant-people. They lay along Judea on the seacoast at the opposite side from Ammon and Moab. They were overthrown by Uzziah (2Ch 26:6), and by Hezekiah (2Ki 18:8). Nebuchadnezzar overran the cities on the seacoast on his way to Egypt after besieging Tyre (Jer 47:1-7). God will take vengeance on those who take the avenging of themselves out of His hands into their own (Ro 12:19-21; Jas 2:13).<div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/poole/ezekiel/25.htm">Matthew Poole's Commentary</a></div> <span class="bld">The Philistines; </span> next neighbours to the Jews, between whom many quarrels, wars, and mutual spoil, slaughter, and injuries happened, as ever among borderers, who make all their own they can catch. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">Have dealt by revenge; </span> took the opportunity to revenge themselves when the Jews were weak and low. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">With a despiteful heart; </span> with hatred to them, and contempt of them. <span class="p"><br /><br /></span><span class="bld">To destroy it for the old hatred:</span> this tells us what their hatred appeared in, it was a hatred to the name and being of Israel, they would cut them off, as <span class="bld"><a href="https://biblehub.com/psalms/83-7.htm" title="Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the inhabitants of Tyre;">Psalm 83:7</a></span>, with a perpetuated, endless enmity pursuing them. <a name="gil" id="gil"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gill/ezekiel/25.htm">Gill's Exposition of the Entire Bible</a></div>Thus saith the Lord God,....

Therefore, behold, I will stretch out my hand against thee, and give thee to the nations for booty, and cut thee off from the peoples, and exterminate thee from the lands; I will destroy thee, that thou mayst learn that I am Jehovah. - In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-28.htm">Ezekiel 21:28</a>., when predicting the expedition of Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem, Ezekiel had already foretold the destruction of the Ammonites, so that these verses are simply a resumption and confirmation of the earlier prophecy. In the passage referred to, Ezekiel, like Zephaniah before him (<a href="http://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-10.htm">Zephaniah 2:10</a>), mentions their reviling of the people of God as the sin for which they are to be punished with destruction. This reviling, in which their hatred of the divine calling of Israel found vent, was the radical sin of Ammon. On the occasion of Judah's fall, it rose even to contemptuous and malicious joy at the profanation of the sanctuary of Jehovah by the destruction of the temple (a comparison with <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-21.htm">Ezekiel 24:21</a> will show that this is the sense in which &#1504;&#1495;&#1500; is to be understood), at the devastation of the land of Israel, and at the captivity of Judah, - in other words, at the destruction of the religious and political existence of Israel as the people of God. The profanation of the sanctuary is mentioned first, to intimate that the hostility to Israel, manifested by the Ammonites on every occasion that presented itself (for proofs, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/zephaniah/2-8.htm">Zephaniah 2:8</a>), had its roots not so much in national antipathies, as in antagonism to the sacred calling of Israel. As a punishment for this, they are not only to lose their land (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-5.htm">Ezekiel 25:5</a>), but to be cut off from the number of the nations (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>). The Lord will give up their land, with its productions, for a possession to the sons of the east, i.e., according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/genesis/25-13.htm">Genesis 25:13-18</a>, to the Arabs, the Bedouins (for &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-3.htm">Judges 6:3</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/job/1-3.htm">Job 1:3</a>). The Piel &#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468;, although only occurring here, is not to be rejected as critically suspicious, and to be changed into Kal, as Hitzig proposes. The Kal would be unsuitable, because the subject of the sentence can only be &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497; &#1511;&#1491;&#1501;, and not &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;&#1497;&#1492;&#1501;; and &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1489; in the Kal has an intransitive sense. For &#1496;&#1497;&#1512;&#1493;&#1514;, tent-villages of nomads, see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/genesis/25-16.htm">Genesis 25:16</a>. &#1502;&#1513;&#1473;&#1499;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, dwellings, are the separate tents of the shepherds. In the last clauses of <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-4.htm">Ezekiel 25:4</a>, &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; is repeated for the sake of emphasis; and Hitzig's opinion, that the first &#1492;&#1502;&#1468;&#1492; corresponds to the subject in the clause '&#1493;&#1497;&#1513;&#1468;&#1473;&#1489;&#1493;&#1468; &#1493;&#1490;&#1493;, the second to that in &#1493;&#1504;&#1514;&#1504;&#1493;&#1468;, is to be rejected as a marvellous flight of imagination, which approaches absurdity in the assertion that &#1508;&#1468;&#1512;&#1497; &#1492;&#1488;&#1512;&#1509; signifies the folds, i.e., the animals, of the land. Along with the fruit of the land, i.e., the produce of the soil, milk is also mentioned as a production of pastoral life, and the principal food of nomads. On the wealth of the Ammonites in flocks and herds, see <a href="https://biblehub.com/judges/6-5.htm">Judges 6:5</a>. The words are addressed to Ammon, as a land or kingdom, and hence the feminine suffix. The capital will also share the fate of the land. Rabbah (see the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/3-11.htm">Deuteronomy 3:11</a>) will become a camel-ground, a waste spot where camels lie down and feed. This has been almost literally fulfilled. The ruins of Ammn are deserted by men, and Seetzen found Arabs with their camels not far off (vid., von Raumer, Palestine, p. 268). In the parallel clause, the sons of Ammon, i.e., the Ammonites, are mentioned instead of their land.<p>In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-6.htm">Ezekiel 25:6</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a>, the Lord announces to the nation of the Ammonites the destruction that awaits them, and reiterates with still stronger emphasis the sin which occasioned it, namely, the malicious delight they had manifested at Israel's fall. &#1489;&#1468;&#1499;&#1500;&#1470;&#1513;&#1473;&#1488;&#1496;&#1498; is strengthened by &#1489;&#1468;&#1504;&#1508;&#1513;&#1473;: with all thy contempt in the soul, i.e., with all the contempt which thy soul could cherish. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-7.htm">Ezekiel 25:7</a> the &#x3b1;&#788;&#x3c0; &#x3bb;&#x3b5;&#x3b3;.. &#1500;&#1489;&#1490; occasions some difficulty. The Keri has substituted &#1500;&#1489;&#1494;, for booty for the nations (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/26-5.htm">Ezekiel 26:5</a>); and all the ancient versions have adopted this. Consequently &#1489;&#1468;&#1490; might be a copyist's error for &#1489;&#1468;&#1494;; and in support of this the circumstance might be adduced, that in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-13.htm">Ezekiel 47:13</a>, where &#1490;&#1468;&#1492; stands for &#1494;&#1492;, we have unquestionably a substitution of &#1490; for &#1494;. But if the Chetib &#1489;&#1494; be correct, the word is to be explained - as it has been by Benfey (Die Montasnamen, p. 194) and Gildemeister (in Lassen's Zeitschrift fr die Kunde des Morgenlandes, iv. 1, p. 213ff.) - from the Sanscrit bha equals ga, pars, portio, and has passed into the Semitic languages from the Aryan, like the Syriac bagaa', esca, which P. Boetticher (Horae aram. p. 21) has correctly traced to the Sanscrit bhaj, conquere. - The executors of the judgment are not named; for the threat that God will give up the land of the Ammonites to the Bedouins for their possession, does not imply that they are to exterminate the Ammonites. On the contrary, a comparison of this passage with <a href="http://biblehub.com/amos/1-13.htm">Amos 1:13-15</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/jeremiah/49-1.htm">Jeremiah 49:1-5</a>, where the Ammonites are threatened not only with the devastation of their land, but also with transportation into exile, will show that the Chaldeans are to be thought of as executing the judgment. (See the comm. on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/25-11.htm">Ezekiel 25:11</a>.) </body></html>
