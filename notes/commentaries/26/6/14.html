Not unto them, in a way of mercy; but upon, or against them, in a way of judgment. The Targum paraphrases it, <p>"and I will lift up the stroke of my power upon them;'' <p>his mighty hand of vengeance: <p>and make the land desolate; by destroying the inhabitants of it: <p>yea, more desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath, in all their habitations; so the Syriac version renders it, "and I will make this land more desolate than the land of Diblath"; but other versions, "I will make the land desolate from the wilderness of Diblath"; to which the Targum agrees; or, "from the wilderness to Diblath": Kimchi and Ben Melech think this is the same with Riblath; as Deuel is put for Reuel in <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/1-14.htm">Numbers 1:14</a>; which was in the land of Hamath, and which, Jerom says, was in his times called Epiphania in Syria; here it was that Nebuchadnezzar brought Zedekiah, and slew his sons before him, <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5</a>; this, though in Hamath in Syria, was on the borders of the land of Israel, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-8.htm">Numbers 34:8</a>; so that "hence from the desert of Diblath", as the Arabic version renders it, "even to Jerusalem", as may be supplied, takes in the whole land, and shows that it should be utterly desolate. There is a Bethdiblathaim mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>; as in Moab; and there is also Almondiblathaim, which was one of the stations of the Israelites; and seems to be in Moab, or on its borders, <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>; and appears, by the places named with it, to be the same as that in Jeremiah; and so was part of that terrible wilderness through which the Israelites passed; and to which the desolation of the land of Israel by the Chaldeans is compared; and which serves to confirm our version, which makes the desolation to be greater than that: <p>and they shall know that I am the Lord; the true God; the one and only Lord God; who never changes his purposes; fulfils his promises and threatenings; and there is no escaping his mighty hand. <a name="gsb" id="gsb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/gsb/ezekiel/6.htm">Geneva Study Bible</a></div><span class="cverse2">So will I stretch out my hand upon them, and make the land desolate, even, more desolate <span class="cverse3">{h}</span> than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the LORD.</span><p>(h) Which was in Syria and bordered on Israel, or from the wilderness which was south, to Diblath which was north: meaning the while country.</div></div><div id="centbox"><div class="padcent"><div class="comtype">EXEGETICAL (ORIGINAL LANGUAGES)</div><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/cambridge/ezekiel/6.htm">Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges</a></div><span class="bld">14</span>. <span class="ital">desolate, yea, more desolate</span>] Rather: <span class="bld">desolate and waste</span> (ch. <a href="https://biblehub.com/context/ezekiel/33-28.htm" title="For I will lay the land most desolate, and the pomp of her strength shall cease; and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, that none shall pass through....">Ezekiel 33:28-29</a>, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-3.htm" title="And say to it, Thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, O mount Seir, I am against you, and I will stretch out my hand against you, and I will make you most desolate.">Ezekiel 35:3</a>) more than the wilderness of Diblah. The comparative “more than,” however, is not probable. Moreover a wilderness of Diblah is unknown; Diblathaim besides being in Moab could not be called desert. The construction is difficult, but probably the reading should be: <span class="ital">from the wilderness to Riblah</span>, i.e. from south to north. Riblah was situated on the northern border of the country (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/34-11.htm" title="And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach to the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:">Numbers 34:11</a>); it is said to be in “the land of Hamath,” <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm" title="Then they took the king, and carried him up to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment on him.">Jeremiah 52:9</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-27.htm" title="And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.">Jeremiah 52:27</a> (where by the converse substitution of <span class="ital">d</span> for <span class="ital">r</span>, LXX. reads Diblah). A few MSS. read Riblah. It must be acknowledged that this way of designating the whole extent of the land from S. to N. is nowhere else employed, the northern limit being usually expressed by “the entering in of Hamath.”<a name="pul" id="pul"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/pulpit/ezekiel/6.htm">Pulpit Commentary</a></div><span class="cmt_sub_title">Verse 14.</span> - <span class="cmt_word">More desolate than the wilderness towards Diblath</span>; better, with the Authorized Version, <span class="accented">from the wilderness.</span> The name does not appear elsewhere, and has not been identified. Assuming the Authorized Version rendering, we must think of Ezekiel as naming, as Dante haines the Valdichiana ('Inf.,' 29:47), some specially horrible and desolate region. For such a region the name of Diblah (a cake of figs) does not seem appropriate. Taking the Revised Version translation ("from the wilderness toward Diblah"), we have a phrase analogous to "from Dan to Beersheba," as denoting the extent of the desolation. The "wilderness" is usually applied to the nomad region south of Palestine, and this would lead us to look for Diblah in the north, and so to look elsewhere than to the two places Beth-diblathaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/48-22.htm">Jeremiah 48:22</a>) and Almon-diblathaim (<a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/33-46.htm">Numbers 33:46</a>), both of which are in Moab. The difficulty was solved by Jerome by the conjectural emendation of Riblah, the two Hebrew letters for <span class="accented">d</span> and <span class="accented">r</span> being often written by copyists for each other. Riblah (it is a suggestive fact that the two chief manuscripts of the LXX. the Alexandrian and the Vatican, have <span class="accented">Deblatha</span>, or <span class="accented">Deblaa</span>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6</a>) was a fortified town on the north road from Palestine to Babylon, where the Babylonian kings used to take up their position during their invasions of the former. Within a short time after Ezekiel wrote this chapter, it became memorable in its connection with Zedekiah's sufferings (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/23-33.htm">2 Kings 23:33</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_kings/25-6.htm">2 Kings 25:6, 20, 21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/39-5.htm">Jeremiah 39:5, 6</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/52-9.htm">Jeremiah 52:9, 10, 26</a>). Its probable site is fixed on the banks of the Orontes. The evidence, on the whole, is, I think, in favour of this interpretation. It is adopted by Ewald, Cornill, Smend, Gesenius, and most recent critics. An additional fact in its favour is that Hamath, in the same region, appears as an ideal northern boundary in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/47-16.htm">Ezekiel 47:16</a>.  <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <span class="p"><br /><br /></span> <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/6.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>The Desolation of the Land, and Destruction of the Idolaters<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-1.htm">Ezekiel 6:1</a>.

The prophet is to prophesy against the mountains of Israel. That the mountains are mentioned (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-2.htm">Ezekiel 6:2</a>) as pars pro toto, is seen from <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-3.htm">Ezekiel 6:3</a>, when to the mountains and hills are added also the valleys and low grounds, as the places where idolatry was specially practised; cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/hosea/4-13.htm">Hosea 4:13</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/2-20.htm">Jeremiah 2:20</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/3-6.htm">Jeremiah 3:6</a>; see on Hos. l.c. and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/12-2.htm">Deuteronomy 12:2</a>. &#1488;&#1508;&#1497;&#1511;&#1497;&#1501;, in the older writings, denotes the "river channels," "the beds of the stream;" but Ezekiel uses the word as equivalent to valley, i.e., &#1504;&#1495;&#1500;, a valley with a brook or stream, like the Arabic wady. &#1490;&#1468;&#1497;&#1488;, properly "deepening," "the deep ground," "the deep valley;" on the form &#1490;&#1468;&#1488;&#1497;&#1493;&#1514;, cf. Ewald, 186da. The juxtaposition of mountains and hills, of valleys and low grounds, occurs again in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-4.htm">Ezekiel 36:4</a>, <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/36-6.htm">Ezekiel 36:6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/35-8.htm">Ezekiel 35:8</a>; the opposition between mountains and valleys also, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/32-5.htm">Ezekiel 32:5-6</a>, and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. The valleys are to be conceived of as furnished with trees and groves, under the shadow of which the worship of Astarte especially was practised; see on v. 15. On the mountains and in the valleys were sanctuaries erected to Baal and Astarte. The announcement of their destruction is appended to the threatening in <a href="http://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>, which Ezekiel takes up and describes at greater length. Beside the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514;, the places of sacrifice and worship, and the &#1495;&#1502;&#1468;&#1504;&#1497;&#1501;, pillars or statues of Baal, dedicated to him as the sun-god, he names also the altars, which, in Lev. l.c. and other places, are comprehended along with the &#1489;&#1468;&#1502;&#1493;&#1514; eht htiw; see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/1_kings/3-3.htm">1 Kings 3:3</a>. With the destruction of the idol temples, altars, and statues, the idol-worshippers are also to be smitten, so as to fall down in the presence of their idols. The fundamental meaning of the word &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1468;&#1493;&#1468;&#1500;&#1497;&#1501;, "idols," borrowed from Lev. l.c., and frequently employed by Ezekiel, is uncertain; signifying either "logs of wood," from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;&#1500;, "to roll" (Gesen.), or stercorei, from &#1490;&#1468;&#1500;, "dung;" not "monuments of stone" (Hvernick). <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-5.htm">Ezekiel 6:5</a> is taken quite literally from <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-30.htm">Leviticus 26:30</a>. The ignominy of the destruction is heightened by the bones of the slain idolaters being scattered round about the idol altars. In order that the idolatry may be entirely rooted out, the cities throughout the whole land, and all the high places, are to be devastated, <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-6.htm">Ezekiel 6:6</a>. The forms &#1514;&#1468;&#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1504;&#1492; and &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493;&#1468; are probably not to be derived from &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501; (Ewald, 138b), but to be referred back to a stem-form &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1501;, with the signification of &#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1501;, the existence of which appears certain from the old name &#1497;&#1513;&#1473;&#1497;&#1502;&#1493;&#1503; in <a href="http://biblehub.com/psalms/68.htm">Psalm 68</a> and elsewhere. The &#1488; in &#1497;&#1488;&#1513;&#1473;&#1502;&#1493; is certainly only mater lectonis. In <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/6-7.htm">Ezekiel 6:7</a>, the singular &#1495;&#1500;&#1500; stands as indefinitely general. The thought, "slain will fall in your midst," involves the idea that not all the people will fall, but that there will survive some who are saved, and prepares for what follows. The falling of the slain - the idolaters with their idols - leads to the recognition of Jehovah as the omnipotent God, and to conversion to Him. </body></html>
