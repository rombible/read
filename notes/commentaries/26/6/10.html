True penitents see sin to be that abominable thing which the Lord hates. Those who truly loathe sin, loathe themselves because of sin. They give glory to God by their repentance. Whatever brings men to remember Him, and their sins against him, should be regarded as a blessing.<a name="bar" id="bar"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/barnes/ezekiel/6.htm">Barnes' Notes on the Bible</a></div>I am broken ... - Translate: "because" I have broken "their whorish heart, which hath departed from me," and their eyes etc. Since Ezekiel is addressing the Church of God through Israel, we are to note here that the general principle of the divine administration is laid down. Sin leads to judgment, judgment to repentance, repentance to forgiveness, forgiveness to reconciliation, reconciliation to a knowledge of communion with God. <a name="jfb" id="jfb"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jfb/ezekiel/6.htm">Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary</a></div>9. they that escape of you shall remember me&#8212;The object of God's chastisements shall at last be effected by working in them true contrition. This partially took place in the complete eradication of idolatry from the Jews ever since the Babylonian captivity. But they have yet to repent of their crowning sin, the crucifixion of Messiah; their full repentance is therefore future, after the ordeal of trials for many centuries, ending with that foretold in Zec 10:9; 13:8, 9; 14:1-4, 11. "They shall remember me in far countries" (Eze 7:16; De 30:1-8).<p>I am broken with their whorish heart&#8212;Fairbairn translates, actively, "I will break" their whorish heart; English Version is better.

To "labour in vain" is the great misery of all workers for God. A time will come when he shall see that God has not sent him to such a work "in vain." What before was dark will be made clear unto him (comp. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-23.htm">Ezekiel 14:23</a>). Ezekiel's words, "not in vain," are echoed frequently by St. Paul (<a href="https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/15-14.htm">1 Corinthians 15:14, 58</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/2_corinthians/6-1.htm">2 Corinthians 6:1</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/philippians/2-16.htm">Philippians 2:16</a>, <span class="accented">et al.</span>). The corresponding phrase, "I have broken their eyes," sounds strange to us; but, after all, the heart is not literally broken more than the eyes, and figuratively the same words may be applied to either, so that there is no need for supposing, with some critics, that a more appropriate verb has been dropped out. Eyes and heart were alike involved in the sin (<a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/20-7.htm">Ezekiel 20:7, 8, 24</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/numbers/15-39.htm">Numbers 15:39</a>), and both came under the same chastisement that was to lead them to repentance. <a name="kad" id="kad"></a><div class="vheading2"><a href="https://biblehub.com/commentaries/kad/ezekiel/5.htm">Keil and Delitzsch Biblical Commentary on the Old Testament</a></div>Further Execution of this Threat<p><a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a>. Therefore shall fathers devour their children in thy midst, and children shall devour their fathers: and I will exercise judgments upon thee, and disperse all thy remnant to the winds. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a>. Therefore, as I live, is the declaration of the Lord Jehovah, Verily, because thou hast polluted my sanctuary with all thine abominations and all thy crimes, so shall I take away mine eye without mercy, and will not spare. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>. A third of thee shall die by the pestilence, and perish by hunger in thy midst; and the third part shall fall by the sword about thee; and the third part will I scatter to all the winds; and will draw out the sword after them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-13.htm">Ezekiel 5:13</a>. And my anger shall be fulfilled, and I will cool my wrath against them, and will take vengeance. And they shall experience that I, Jehovah, have spoken in my zeal, when I accomplish my wrath upon them. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. And I will make thee a desolation and a mockery among the nations which are round about thee, before the eyes of every passer-by. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>. And it shall be a mockery and a scorn, a warning and a terror for the nations round about thee, when I exercise my judgments upon thee in anger and wrath and in grievous visitations. I, Jehovah, have said it. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>. When I send against thee the evil arrows of hunger, which minister to destruction, which I shall send to destroy you; for hunger shall I heap upon you, and shall break to you the staff of bread. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a>. And I shall send hunger upon you, and evil beasts, which shall make thee childless; and pestilence and blood shall pass over thee; and the sword will I bring upon thee. I, Jehovah, have spoken it. - As a proof of the unheard-of severity of the judgment, there is immediately mentioned in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-10.htm">Ezekiel 5:10</a> a most horrible circumstance, which had been already predicted by Moses (<a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-29.htm">Leviticus 26:29</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-53.htm">Deuteronomy 28:53</a>) as that which should happen to the people when hard pressed by the enemy, viz., a famine so dreadful, during the siege of Jerusalem, that parents would eat their children, and children their parents; and after the capture of the city, the dispersion of those who remained "to all the winds, i.e., to all quarters of the world." This is described more minutely, as an appendix to the symbolical act in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>, in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-11.htm">Ezekiel 5:11</a> and <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>, with a solemn oath, and with repeated and prominent mention of the sins which have drawn down such chastisements. As sin, is mentioned the pollution of the temple by idolatrous abominations, which are described in detail in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/8.htm">Ezekiel 8</a>. The &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, which is variously understood by the old translators (for which some Codices offer the explanatory correction &#1488;&#1490;&#1491;&#1506;), is to be explained, after <a href="http://biblehub.com/job/36-7.htm">Job 36:7</a>, of the "turning away of the eye," and the &#1506;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497; following as the object; while &#1493;&#1500;&#1488;&#1470;&#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1505;, "that it feel no compassion," is interjected between the verb and its object with the adverbial signification of "mercilessly." For that the words &#1493;&#1500;&#1488; &#1514;&#1495;&#1493;&#1505; are adverbially subordinate to &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506;, distinctly appears from the correspondence - indicated by &#1493;&#1490;&#1501; &#1488;&#1504;&#1497; - between &#1488;&#1490;&#1512;&#1506; and &#1500;&#1488; . Moreover, the thought, "Jehovah will mercilessly withdraw His care for the people," is not to be termed "feeble" in connection with what follows; nor is the contrast, which is indicated in the clause &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497;, lost, as Hvernick supposes. &#1493;&#1490;&#1501;&#1470;&#1488;&#1504;&#1497; does not require &#1490;&#1468;&#1512;&#1506; to be understood of a positive act, which would correspond to the desecration of the sanctuary. This is shown by the last clause of the verse. The withdrawal without mercy of the divine providence is, besides, in reality, equivalent to complete devotion to destruction, as it is particularized in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a>. For <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-12.htm">Ezekiel 5:12</a> see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-1.htm">Ezekiel 5:1</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-2.htm">Ezekiel 5:2</a>. By carrying out the threatened division of the people into three parts, the wrath of God is to be fulfilled, i.e., the full measure of the divine wrath upon the people is to be exhausted (cf. 7, 8), and God is to appear and "cool" His anger. &#1492;&#1504;&#1497;&#1495; &#1495;&#1502;&#1492;, "sedavit iram," occurs again in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/16-42.htm">Ezekiel 16:42</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/21-22.htm">Ezekiel 21:22</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/24-13.htm">Ezekiel 24:13</a>. &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, Hithpael, pausal form for &#1492;&#1504;&#1468;&#1495;&#1502;&#1514;&#1468;&#1497;, "se consolari," "to procure satisfaction by revenge;" cf. <a href="http://biblehub.com/isaiah/1-24.htm">Isaiah 1:24</a>, and for the thing, <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/28-63.htm">Deuteronomy 28:63</a>. In <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-14.htm">Ezekiel 5:14</a>. the discourse turns again from the people to the city of Jerusalem. It is to become a wilderness, as was already threatened in <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-31.htm">Leviticus 26:31</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/26-33.htm">Leviticus 26:33</a> to the cities of Israel, and thereby a "mockery" to all nations, in the manner described in <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/29-23.htm">Deuteronomy 29:23</a>. &#1493;&#1492;&#1497;&#1514;&#1492;, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-15.htm">Ezekiel 5:15</a>, is not to be changed, after the lxx, Vulgate, and some MSS, into the second person; but Jerusalem is to be regarded as the subject which is to become the object of scorn and hatred, etc., when God accomplishes His judgments. &#1502;&#1493;&#1468;&#1505;&#1512; is a warning-example. Among the judgments which are to overtake it, in <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-16.htm">Ezekiel 5:16</a>, hunger is again made specially prominent (cf. <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/4-16.htm">Ezekiel 4:16</a>) and first in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/5-17.htm">Ezekiel 5:17</a> are wild beasts, pestilence, blood, and sword added, and a quartette of judgments announced as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. For pestilence and blood are comprehended together as a unity by means of the predicate. Their connection is to be understood according to <a href="http://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-19.htm">Ezekiel 14:19</a>, and the number four is significant, as in <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>; <a href="https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/15-3.htm">Jeremiah 15:3</a>. For more minute details as to the meaning, see on <a href="https://biblehub.com/ezekiel/14-21.htm">Ezekiel 14:21</a>. The evil arrows point back to <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-23.htm">Deuteronomy 32:23</a>; the evil beasts, to <a href="https://biblehub.com/leviticus/24-22.htm">Leviticus 24:22</a> and <a href="https://biblehub.com/deuteronomy/32-24.htm">Deuteronomy 32:24</a>. To produce an impression, the prophet heaps his words together. Unum ejus consilium fuit penetrare in animos populi quasi lapideos et ferreos. Haec igitur est ratio, cur hic tanta varietate utatur et exornet suam doctrnam variis figuris (Calvin). </body></html>
